Hotel Workers Agree to Keep On Negotiating
At the urging of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York City hotel owners and their union workers agreed yesterday to continue negotiating into the holiday weekend and to put off a strike or lockout, at least until midnight on Tuesday.
The collective bargaining agreement between the Hotel Association of New York City, which is representing 79 of its member hotels in the talks, and the 22,000-member New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, expired last night.
Union members -- bellhops, waiters, bartenders, room attendants and others -- voted earlier this week in favor of a strike called by union leaders against any or all of the association's hotels.


Celebrating the Holiday Weekend


Bachauer Competition Announces Winners
The Juilliard School has named the winners of its 1995 Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition.
They are Sean Botkin, a 1993 master's graduate of the Juilliard School, and Min-Kyung Kwon, a Korean-born graduate of the Curtis Institute of Music.


F.B.I. Checks Bomber Credo For New Clues
Experts at the Federal Bureau of Investigation spent today poring over the lengthy manifesto written by the self-described anarchist who has engaged in a 17-year campaign of mail bombings, but agents offered no new theories in the case.
The man, suspected of having mailed 16 bombs that killed three people and injured 23, disrupted airline flights and mail delivery in California this week by threatening to blow up an airplane.
He later said the threat was a prank intended to draw attention to his credo, expressed in a lengthy manuscript mailed to The New York Times and The Washington Post.


Not Conventional, but Well Received
No one would confuse the free production of Verdi's "Lombardi" by the New York Grand Opera in Central Park on Wednesday with a fully realized, strongly cast production.
But in some ways it was a chastisement to concert and opera producers who claim audiences demand conventional programming.
"I Lombardi," the fourth installment of a project to present all 28 Verdi operas in order over seven summers, drew a capacity audience to Rumsey Playfield; for the most part, they listened attentively.


Sports of The Times; There's No Luxury Tax For Coaches
HERE is David Stern's communique to his players, on the morning of the first work stoppage in National Basketball Association history: Don Nelson can negotiate his millions, unfettered by luxury taxes, caps and lockouts, but you can't.
Have a great holiday weekend.
The N.B.A.'s commissioner and benevolent dictator said he tried, really tried, to avoid a summer shutdown that could eventually drag his upscale sport into the gutter baseball now tries to crawl out of.
Michael Jordan and the gang of unholy agents gave him no choice.
They submarined the deal the league agreed to with representatives of the players union.
Not his fault.


How the March of Dimes Got Behind Dr. Salk; A Child's Prayer
To the Editor:
The passing of Dr.
Jonas Salk brought back childhood memories.
In Michigan, in 1954, I was one of the children who participated in the testing of the Salk vaccine.
I remember lining up for the shots and knowing that half of us would receive the real vaccine and half of us the placebo and praying that I would be in the "real" group, so I wouldn't have to go back and get the shots over again.


Man Who Killed Escobar Gets 43 Years
The gunman who killed a soccer star after the player's blunder helped eliminate Colombia from last year's World Cup was sentenced yesterday in Bogota to 43 years in prison.
HUMBERTO MUNOZ CASTRO, a driver for a business executive, was sentenced in a court in Medellin.
He shot Andres Escobar on July 2, 1994, in Medellin, 155 miles northwest of Bogota.
Days earlier, Escobar had accidentally kicked the ball into his own team's net in a match the United States won, 2-1, to eliminate Colombia. (AP)


RESULTS PLUS
ROWING Washington and Princeton Advance
Advancing on the Thames as smoothly as the gaggle of geese that glidingly interrupted yesterday's third-round races at the Henley Royal Regatta, the varsity heavyweight eights from the University of Washington and Princeton made it to the semifinals of the Ladies Challenge Plate, the major test among college eights at the regatta.
Washington outdistanced a Cambridge crew, the Free Press, named after a local Cambridge pub, by three boat lengths in other competition in Henley-on-Thames, England.
Princeton defeated a Leander Club-Oxford University crew by one and one-half boat lengths in a commanding effort.
Harvard's lightweight varsity took an immediate lead on Syracuse's varsity, which was no match for the Crimson finesse, and won by 1 1/4 lengths to become the only United States crew to make it to the quarterfinals of the Thames Challenge Cup; Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford Rowing Club joined Syracuse in the losers column.
CYCLING Armstrong's Tour Goal: To Finish
When he begins his third Tour de France today in Saint-Brieuc, Lance Armstrong of the United States wants to go where he never has been -- to the finish line.
After two planned desertions to protect his young body, Armstrong, the 1993 world champion is convinced he has finally come of cycling age at 23 and hopes to finish when the Tour ends in Paris on July 23.
After a lackluster 1994 season, Armstrong started well this year, winning the Tour DuPont, the biggest United States race.
Overshadowing Armstrong's campaign will be the quest of Miguel Indurain for a record fifth consecutive triumph.
Challenging him over the 2,254 miles will be the Swiss veteran Tony Rominger and the Russian Yevgeny Berzin. (AP)


Canadiens Trade Bellows After Off Season
The Montreal Canadiens yesterday traded BRIAN BELLOWS to the Tampa Bay Lightning for wing MARC BUREAU.
Bellows, 30, a former 50-goal scorer and a member of Montreal's 1993 Stanley Cup champions, is coming off a disappointing season of 8 goals and 8 assists in 41 games. (AP)


Mayor Says Casino Plan Excludes New York
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vowed yesterday to oppose a ballot referendum that would permit casino gambling in New York State unless legislators change the measure to permit gambling in New York City.
Late Thursday, the State Legislature approved a resolution that would allow casinos in certain areas of the state, including Niagara Falls, Lake George, and the Catskills -- but not in New York City or on Long Island.
To become law, the constitutional amendment must be approved again by the Legislature in 1997 and would then go before voters late that year or in 1998.


Boeing Will Reduce Production of 2 Planes
The Boeing Company said yesterday that it would scale back production of its 737 and 757 commercial jets, but the company said the changes would not result in job losses beyond those announced earlier this year.
Analysts said the announcement was not surprising because the 737 models being cut were soon to be superseded and the 757 had seen its sales cannibalized by larger variants of the 737.


Journal; Newt To the Rescue
My new hero is Newt Gingrich, who has stood up to Bob Dole, Ralph Reed and the rest of our preacher politicians to say no to a Senate computer "decency act" that isn't just cybersilly but plain old-fashioned idiotic.
This bipartisan folly, concocted by the Democrat James Exon and the Republican Dan Coats, purports to protect our computer-fixated kids from pornography but in fact would fail at that even as it maims the Internet, abridges the First Amendment and creates a new bureaucracy to rival the Pentagon.
Why does the Speaker stand tall on this issue?
I hope principle comes first.
He also has the advantage of actually being conversant with computers.
The same cannot be said of his grandstanding colleagues, who, when they aren't condemning movies they haven't seen, will destroy a technology they've apparently never used.


Warehouse Workers Fall Ill
A wave of nausea, dizziness and headaches hit the night shift at the United Parcel Service warehouse in Raritan Center yesterday, forcing the evacuation of 300 workers, 29 of whom were taken to hospitals, where they were treated and released.
There were no serious injuries.
"We did extensive testing and weren't able to locate a source for the problem," said Richard Kozub, chief of the Middlesex County hazardous materials unit, which dispatched eight inspectors to the scene.
"But it's a huge facility with trucks in and out all night." The inspectors tested the air and the conveyor machinery, and no problems were found.
Drums of hazardous material routinely pass through the warehouse, a major U.P.S. shipment point.


Jeffries's Successor at City College Defends Ex-Department Head
The man chosen to succeed Dr.
Leonard Jeffries as head of the department of black studies at City College defended his predecessor yesterday, while steadfastly refusing to comment on Dr.
Jeffries's widely criticized views.
The new leader said the department had to move "in the direction of reconciliation and healing."
Whatever the new chairman, Prof.
Moyibi J. Amoda, really thinks of his colleague's views on Jews or his characterization of blacks as "sun" people and whites as "ice" people, it was clear in a telephone interview from London that the department has a politically cautious man who, by his words or presence, would appear unlikely to polarize the campus.


Taking In the Air Along With the Sights


Roberto De Lamonica, 62, Artist, Dies
Roberto De Lamonica, an artist and teacher of graphics at the Art Students League for nearly 30 years, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan.
He was 62 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause was emphysema, said Lawrence Campbell, archivist of the Art Students League.


In Stronghold, Serbs Cite Dread of Muslim Rule
War has transformed this remote mountain village from a placid outpost at the foot of a ski slope to the improbable headquarters of a regime that has been condemned around the world for savagery and ethnic chauvinism.
The Bosnian Serbs made Pale their capital three years ago, and from a scattering of chalets on the nearby hillsides their leaders direct a brutal military campaign while wondering why they are so misunderstood.


Hate Messages in the Schools
The prom season has turned mean and teachers, administrators and other students are searching desperately for reasons and responses.
Recently, three seniors at Norman Thomas High School in Manhattan sent an anti-Semitic note to a teacher, and two Jewish students at Midwood High School in Brooklyn were linked to a yearbook advertisement construed as both anti-Semitic and anti-black.
It was also discovered that five seniors at the Greenwich, Conn., high school spread a hateful message directed against blacks under the pictures in their yearbook.
Chancellor Ramon Cortines was going to allow the Norman Thomas students to attend graduation ceremonies until protests from teachers, the Board of Education and several City Council members persuaded him to reverse himself and ban them.
The Midwood students were also banned from graduation ceremonies.
The students involved in both incidents will receive their diplomas.


Governor Signs Budget, Vetoing Many Insertions
Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman signed her budget for the coming fiscal year today, praising Republican legislative leaders for giving her everything she wanted while using her veto power to eliminate most of the things they wanted.
Shortly afterward, hundreds of Motor Vehicles Department employees walked off their jobs when they learned that among the items vetoed were provisions aimed at preventing Mrs.
Whitman from turning almost two dozen agency branch offices over to private management companies.


Venezuela's Working to Reassure Investors
To the Editor:
"Yankees, Phone Home! GTE Role in Venezuela Is Warning on Privatization" (Business Day, June 21) states that the negative experience of GTE, the managing partner of the private consortium that manages and partly owns Venezuela's national telephone company, Cantv, should discourage others from investing in Venezuela.
None of the statements attributed to Cantv, GTE and Salomon Brothers support what your headline asserts.


Hairs Resembling Simpson's Are Identified by an Expert
A prosecution expert testified today that 12 hairs matching those of O. J. Simpson were found on both sides of the blue knit cap found near the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman, and that other hairs resembling Mr.
Simpson's were lifted from Mr.
Goldman's shirt and a crucial leather glove.
In a day devoted to tracing how hair migrated from one person or object to another and what that movement means, the expert, Douglas Deedrick of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, also testified that hairs resembling Mrs.
Simpson's and Mr.
Goldman's were found on the crumpled leather glove retrieved from behind Mr.
Simpson's house on Rockingham Avenue here.


No Easy Victory in the Cocaine Wars
Authorities in Colombia have made some impressive arrests of leaders of the Cali cocaine cartel in recent weeks.
Most notable was the capture of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, one of the cartel's most powerful figures.
His younger brother, Jorge Eliecer Rodriguez Orejuela, was arrested in March.
At about the same time, President Clinton gave Colombia a failing grade on its efforts to stop the drug trade.
Since then Bogota has been trying harder, with the help of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration, to crack down on the drug lords.
But it is still too early to declare victory.
In March Mr.
Clinton sensibly waived the sanctions that usually accompany a negative assessment on drug interdiction, maintaining it would serve Washington's interests better to continue helping Colombia fight its drug lords.
They are, after all, serving a seemingly endless demand from North America.
The cooperative approach has produced some victories.

N.B.A. Locks Out Players in First Work Stoppage
The National Basketball Association, previously untarnished by the labor conflicts that have damaged all of the other major professional sports, said yesterday that it was locking out its players and suspending its operations until a new collective bargaining agreement is reached.
The lockout, which began at 12:01 A.M. today, is the first labor action in N.B.A. history but the third in professional sports in less than a year.
Baseball players struck last Aug. 12, and the National Hockey League locked out its players Oct. 1.


Corrections
An article last Saturday about Waneta E. Hoyt, who is awaiting sentencing for killing her five children over a seven-year span, from 1965 to 1971, misstated the first name of her lawyer.
He is William Sullivan, not Robert.


Legislators Pass Bill to Seize A School District in Nassau
In an action that could lead to the first state takeover of a local school district in New York history, lawmakers in Albany today approved legislation to give state officials broad authority over the troubled Roosevelt school system in Nassau County.
The bill, adopted by both houses of the Legislature just before the end of the legislative session, would not only create a panel of experts to oversee improvements in the district, but would also allow the state to take control of the system if the local school board drags its feet.

Some Bed-Wetting Is Linked to a Gene
Researchers say a gene somewhere on chromosome 13 is linked to the most problematic form of bed-wetting, primary enuresis, in which children 7 years old or older wet the bed three or more times a week.
Only the general location of the gene has been found, not the exact site, and it may not be the entire explanation or the only gene involved.


Investment Fund for Colleges Says Trader Caused $128 Million Loss
The Common Fund, which oversees almost $20 billion of funds for colleges and other educational institutions, said yesterday that a rogue trader had caused it to lose an estimated $128 million.
The loss resulted from "unauthorized trading" at First Capital Strategists Inc., a securities firm in York, Pa., that manages some of the securities owned by the Common Fund, according to David K. Storrs, the president of the fund.


A Window to the Fourth


Islanders Interview Neilson
The next Islander coach could be a veteran with knowledge of his primary local rivals.
The candidate is Roger Neilson, who coached the Florida Panthers for the past two seasons after leaving the Rangers midway through the 1992-93 season.
Don Maloney, general manager of the Islanders, interviewed Neilson via telephone yesterday and said afterward: "I like Roger Neilson. He's as smart a man as there is in hockey. He's an interesting candidate."


Plenty of Huffing Over Puffs
What's in a name?
Eli M. Feuer, a Lakewood entrepreneur who started marketing a children's toilet-training tissue called Potty-Puffs 10 months ago, found out when Proctor &amp; Gamble, the consumer products giant in Cincinnati, sued over his use of the word "puffs." Potty-Puffs infringed on the company's trademark for Puffs facial tissue and created unfair competition, P &amp; G said yesterday.


Ruling on Condoms
For two years, distribution of free condoms was part of the All Saints Lutheran Parish annual basketball tournament in the South Bronx.
But this year the city's Parks and Recreation Department has forbidden condom distribution in city parks and recreation sites.
In response to the church's request for help, lawyers from the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit to try to force the city to allow the condoms to be given out.
Their request was granted, but state law gives the city an automatic stay from adhering to the ruling.

Rodman Is Cleared in Herpes Suit
A Federal jury in Atlanta ruled yesterday that there was no evidence that the National Basketball Association star DENNIS RODMAN infected a former Atlanta Hawks cheerleader with herpes.
The United States District Court jury ruled for Rodman in a suit brought by LISA BETH JUDD, who was seeking damages.
Jurors deliberated less than four hours.
Judd charged that Rodman infected her while he was in town with the Detroit Pistons.
Rodman, now with San Antonio, said there was no evidence that he suffered from a transmittable form of herpes. (AP)


Arson Blamed for Pinelands Fire
The roaring blaze that burned 19,000 acres of the Pine Barrens in April was caused by three acts of arson, said Col.

After 114 Years, It's Payday; Patience Is Rewarded Meagerly As Inflation Erodes 1881 Bonds
It's been 114 years in coming, but there is good news for those who lent money to the Santa Fe railroad in 1881.
They are about to be paid back.
Checks for part of the loan will go out today.
Lenders will have to be patient a little while longer, though, until October, to get the rest.
The seemingly endless Santa Fe story illustrates almost everything that can go wrong for a lender, short of a complete failure to pay.
Those who lent the money -- or perhaps their great-grandchildren -- are about to get dollars that are each worth less than seven 1881 cents.
Along the way, the lenders have suffered through corporate reorganizations, fraudulent accounting and foolish business plans.
They have been buffeted by volatile interest rates and by worries over credit quality.
And they even lost their protection against inflation when Congress and the Supreme Court teamed up against them in the 1930's.


Sterling Sharpe Withdraws Suit
The former Packers receiver STERLING SHARPE has withdrawn a lawsuit charging that the team, the National Football League and the N.F.L.
Players Association denied him due process.
Sharpe has a July 11 hearing before a Federal judge, DAVID DOTY, in Minneapolis on whether half the $3.2 million salary Sharpe still seeks in an injury grievance applies to the salary cap.
Sharpe was released this year after surgery to fuse two neck vertebrae. (AP)


Local Pro Finds Spotlight Is Too Hot at Senior Open
Larry Ringer, a local club pro who shared the lead after one round of the United States Senior Open, fell abruptly back to earth today as more familiar names vaulted to the top of the leader board.
While sunny skies began to dry out the soggy Congressional Country Club course and with all the other leaders long in the clubhouse, Ringer, a popular local pro, soared to an 80.
That left the way open for 58-year-old Tommy Aaron, who made a late charge with three birdies on the back nine in a round of four-under-par 68.
That put him at 138, six under par, and gave him a share of the lead with Tom Weiskopf.
Aaron lipped out a 6-foot putt at the 17th that would have put him alone in the lead.


Knicks' Signs Are Pointing Toward Nelson
The commotion swirling around Pat Riley angers the Knicks more and more each day.

Somewhere between the Riley saga and the courtship of Don Nelson, the Knicks hope to get over the hurt and move on.
Though club officials say no deal is imminent, all signs are pointing toward Nelson to replace Riley.

Knudsen Gets Debt Accord With Banks
Just hours away from a bankruptcy-law filing, the Morrison Knudsen Corporation said yesterday that it had reached a preliminary agreement with its banks for financing to get it through most of 1995.
The big engineering company's banks agreed to provide $30 million in new loans and to extend the maturity on another $99 million in loans until late in the year, Robert S. Miller, the company's chairman, said.


L'Amour and Can-Cans In the Nether World
In the 1980's, small opera companies in this city dropped like flies.
Money was harder to come by; unions wanted terms for their musicians that could not or would not be met.
A lot of honorable people went out of business.
So what are we to make of L'Opera Francais de New York, from whose jerry-built beginnings seven years ago have come sold-out houses in major venues, ardent corporate and philanthropic support and first-class performances?
The choice of Offenbach's "Orphee aux Enfers" partly explains Wednesday's night's happy house at Alice Tully Hall.
The period-piece burlesqueries may creak, but the high energy, the bright light of piccolo-driven sonorities and Offenbach's overflowing songfulness all make good summer entertainment.


Art Finds Its Buyers At Sales In London
The sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, which ended here on Thursday, were the most successful that Christie's and Sotheby's had seen in London in five years.
While neither auction house was selling material from big-name estates, each offered a handful of top-quality paintings, which buyers from both sides of the Atlantic fought hard to own.
The week's most exciting moment was at Christie's on Monday evening when Monet's "Rouen Cathedral, Afternoon Effect (Full Sunlight on the Front Entrance)," a sun-dappled view of the building's facade, one of a series of 30 variations the artist painted of the cathedral from 1892 to 1894, sold for $12.1 million, more than twice Christie's estimate of $5.5 million.
The painting went to an unidentified collector who bid by telephone.


Facing Threat in Parliament, Yeltsin Removes 3 Ministers
Moving decisively to reshape his Government before an important parliamentary challenge on Saturday, President Boris N. Yeltsin announced tonight that he was dismissing the ministers of Security, the Interior, and Nationalities for their failures in responding to a hostage-taking by Chechen rebels in southern Russia.
It was the most serious Government shake-up since the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991, and it represents something of a gamble for Mr.
Yeltsin.
He is removing most of the so-called power ministers, whose ministries were involved in the failed August 1991 coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.


Zhuzhou Journal; On China's Overburdened Highway System, It's the Big Stall
New York commuters who get steamed over traffic snarls might consider the plight of 24-year-old Zhou Hui and his two companions, who have been in traffic jams that last as long as three days.
Hanging out of the cab of his 10-ton truck, which was straining under the 14 tons of lumber draped over its backside, Mr.
Zhou gazed up the line of traffic that stretched to the horizon in front of him and shook his head.


Court Upholds a Ban on 'Indecent' Broadcast Programming
Rebuffing broadcasters and civil liberties groups, a sharply divided Federal appeals court today upheld regulations that prohibit radio and television stations from carrying sexually oriented "indecent" programs between 6 A.M. and 10 P.M.
The 7-to-4 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit essentially preserves restrictions that Congress imposed in 1993.
The court emphatically rejected arguments by broadcasters that the restrictions were too broad and said the Government had a "compelling interest" in shielding children from steamy programs beamed over the airwaves.


After Brief Respite, Central Virginia Gets Soaked Again
Rain that had fallen on central and southern Virginia for a week subsided for a time today but then returned with fury tonight, when a thunderstorm lashed the heart of the region and threatened more flash flooding.
It was the last thing Virginia needed.
The earlier rains, the product of a stagnant storm system that refused to blow over, had already killed at least six people, destroyed scores of homes and forced thousands of residents to evacuate.
Creeks were turned into rivers, rivers into lakes and cornfields into muddy flats.


Clinton Proposes Complete Ban On Armor-Piercing Ammunition
Wrapped in the mantle of law and order in a city whose Democratic dynasty made that notion its political shield, President Clinton today proposed a new Federal ban on all armor-piercing bullets, whatever they are made of.
"If a bullet can rip through a bulletproof vest like a knife through hot butter, then it ought to be history," Mr.
Clinton said in accepting an award from the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence at a police station house accompanied by Chicago's mayor, Richard M. Daley.


President Weighing Risks of Rejecting Base-Closings List
Facing outrage in California, the White House and Pentagon are weighing the political costs of rejecting, for the first time, the recommendations of an independent commission on the closing of military bases.
A tug-of-war centered on McClellan Air Force Base near Sacramento has developed between White House political operatives, who view California's 54 electoral votes as crucial to President Clinton's 1996 campaign hopes, and commission members, who are vowing to stick to their guns to close it and eliminate nearly 11,000 military and civilian jobs.


Victory on Religion Rulings Was Limited, Groups Say
Conservative religious groups counted as victories the two Supreme Court decisions this week allowing religious symbols like crosses and creches in public parks and some government support for religious organizations.
But despite these successes, the groups said they would continue to press for a constitutional amendment giving protection to student-led prayer.
"It's going to take a long time to implement these decisions, and an amendment is a lot faster," said Jay Sekulow, who is chief counsel for one of the conservative groups, the American Center for Law and Justice.

The Extra-Special Olympics
More than 7,000 athletes from 140 nations have come to New Haven to compete in the largest sports event taking place anywhere in the world this year -- the Special Olympics World Games.
These contestants, young and old, are all mentally retarded, and every one of them is a winner just for trying so hard.
It is an inspiring event, likely to put a big lump in the throat of every spectator.
"Leave your tears at home," says Lowell Weicker, former Governor of Connecticut, father of a teen-ager with Down syndrome and chairman of the New Haven games, which begin today.
"This event speaks about gifts and competence, not disability." Credit Eunice Kennedy Shriver with the idea.
She founded the Special Olympics in the 1960's, having first started a summer day camp for mentally retarded children.


Murray Switches Over to the Esteemed 3,000-Hit Club
It was a ground ball to the right side of the infield, and the Minnesota Twins' second baseman, Chuck Knoblauch, dived to get it but it was just out of his reach.
Eddie Murray, Cleveland's designated hitter tonight, had his hit.
It was only a single, but one would never know it from the sound of the crowd of 27,412 in the Metrodome, or from the stream of Murray's Indians teammates spewing from the dugout and the bullpen to congratulate him.

A Year After Its Leader's Death, Lubavitch Proclaims Itself Strong
A year ago the Lubavitch Hasidim were deep in mourning over the death of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.
For 44 years Rabbi Schneerson, the seventh Grand Rabbi of the influential Lubavitch movement, had presided over its worldwide expansion and developed a bond with members so profound that some Lubavitchers considered him the Moshiach, or Messiah.
As a result, some outside the movement had wondered whether without him or a designated successor, Lubavitch would fray, descending into factionalism.

New York Suspends Its Financial Adviser
A financial advisory company was suspended from its city contract yesterday after officials determined that it had not paid city taxes for the last five years.
The company, P. G. Corbin of Philadelphia, is one of two financial advisers that help market New York City's bonds.
Last July, the Giuliani administration objected to Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi's decision to retain the company, saying one adviser was sufficient and suggesting that the black-owned company had been hired because of racial preferences.


Lana Turner Is Dead at 75; 'Sweater Girl' and Sultry Star
Lana Turner, who built a successful movie career on her first screen appearance as a teen-age "sweater girl," died on Thursday.
She was 75 and lived in Los Angeles.

7 Found Not Guilty in Plot Tied to a Mob Family Feud
In a case that hinged on the connection between an F.B.I. agent and a mob captain acting as an informer, all seven suspected members of a faction of the Colombo crime family were found not guilty yesterday of conspiring to murder members of another faction.
There was virtually rapt silence in Judge Edward R. Korman's courtroom in the Federal courthouse in downtown Brooklyn as the first six names were read and followed by, "Not guilty," and then an eruption of glee as up to 100 friends and relatives, the defendants and their lawyers punched the air, shouted, hugged, wept and slapped one another's backs at the final finding.
The jury deliberated 12 hours in the seven-week trial.


Junior Senators Prevent a Vote On Budget Cuts
A Senate vote on a new package of midyear budget cuts negotiated by the White House and Congressional leaders from both parties was unexpectedly derailed today when two of the most junior Democratic Senators refused to go along with the deal.
Against the wishes of Democratic leaders who seemed helpless to stop them, Senators Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois began a bumbling filibuster in an effort to restore about $600 million to the $16 billion bill, for youth job training programs and assistance for the elderly.


Astronauts Have a Day Of Work And Play
Ten Russian and American astronauts today exchanged gifts, talked to political leaders and got down to their first full day of joint investigations as they sped around the globe once every 92 minutes in history's largest spacecraft, an American space shuttle linked to a Russian space station to form a sprawling, half-million-pound complex.
"You've set a great example and created a symbol for progress that we can make in the future," Vice President Al Gore told the astronauts today in a congratulatory phone call from Moscow, where he is meeting with the Russian Prime Minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, to hammer out new East-West accords.


Corrections
An article on Thursday about the Congressional Ethics Committee's investigation of allegations against House Speaker Newt Gingrich referred incorrectly to a comment in The Washington Post last January by the president of Doubleday, about the auction of Mr.
Gingrich's manuscript.
The Doubleday executive, Stephen Rubin, never told The Post that the manuscript auction was rigged.
According to The Post, he did call the auction "murky," saying that the rules used by Mr.
Gingrich's agent for the sale were acceptable "if she tells us those are the rules." "She never did that," Mr.
Rubin said, according to The Post.


Perez's Outing Troubles Pitching-Poor Yanks
Jimmy Key never even made it to the mound today during his rehabilitation session because of a painful left shoulder.
Melido Perez sauntered off the mound after two and one-third sloppy innings tonight against the Brewers because of a stiff right shoulder.
One of the next voices the Yankees hear will be Toronto General Manager Gord Ash raising the price for David Cone.
After losing Key for probably the rest of the season and perhaps beyond when he struggled while throwing off flat ground in Tampa, Fla., Manager Buck Showalter could not have envisioned that another Yankee starter in another time zone would wiggle his arm after 47 pitches and leave the game.
But Perez did and his shoulder had been iced when the Brewers finished steaming to a 12-6 victory and squashed their seven-game losing streak.

Church Tests A Parks Ban On Condoms
A tiny South Bronx church's annual basketball tournament has become the unlikely catalyst for a court test of the Giuliani administration's position that condoms should not be handed out in city parks.

U.S. Lifting Trade Penalties On Taiwan
President Clinton announced today that the United States was lifting trade sanctions imposed against Taiwan last year for refusing to stop the sale of tiger bones and rhinoceros parts.
The move, which ends a ban on imports of Taiwanese sea and wildlife products like coral jewelry and lizard boots, was in response to Taiwan's recent actions to raise penalties for trafficking in tiger and rhino parts and to increase police efforts to crack down on such sales.

Toll Takers On Parkway Authorize A Walkout
Toll takers on the Garden State Parkway voted yesterday to authorize a strike, as officials of the parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike braced for possible job actions that could disrupt traffic over the long Fourth of July weekend.
Any strike would be illegal, state officials said, adding that they were prepared to seek back-to-work court orders as soon as a strike began.
They also said that temporary summer workers and supervisors would work in toll booths.


In John Major's London, Lots of Tea and Treachery
Under the daggerlike Gothic spires and within the nicotine-yellow walls of Westminster, connected by a single hidden door to the House of Commons, lies a warren of corridors, three bars, an open-air terrace and a two-chambered cafeteria of plush seats and quiet corners.
Off limits to all but Members of Parliament, it is generically called the "tearoom" and even in the best of times it is a center of political gossip and horse-trading.
But these days, in the frenzy of a race for the leadership of the Conservative Party that could go exploding off in any direction, the tearoom is a veritable pit of intrigue, alliance and betrayal.
It is to John Major's Britain what the Borgias' palace was to early 16th-century Italy.

Beliefs
The meeting had an academic title, "Symposium on Political Islam and Women in Algeria," and for long stretches it had an academic air.
It was easy to forget that several participants were living under the threat of death.
Even Prof.
Marnia Lazreg, who organized the symposium, admitted that when the day finally came, "I was scared of retaliation." Algeria, after all, is gripped in a civil war between a military government and armed Islamic militants whose political party, the Islamic Salvation Front, was suppressed after its election victories in 1990 and 1991.


GIULIANI IN ACCORD WITH LABOR CHIEFS OVER CONCESSIONS
On the eve of New York City's new fiscal year, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and leaders of the municipal unions announced last night that they had reached tentative agreement on $440 million in labor concessions for the coming year, and on unspecified commitments for $160 million in added savings.
The agreement fell short of spelling out the full $600 million that the Mayor had included in the budget for the new year, which begins today.
The Mayor's top labor negotiator said the unspecified savings would be announced by October at the latest, as the city negotiates with individual unions in collective bargaining.

With Leads Fading, Son Presses Search for U.S. Relief Worker in Chechnya
Early in the search for Frederick C. Cuny, the disaster relief expert who disappeared in Chechnya in April, there were two Cuny family members, three interpreters, a Chechen guide, a Cossack private investigator, two cars with four drivers and several American diplomats and international aid experts working feverishly to track him down.
Now the pace of the search has slowed, and the cramped, rented house known as Cuny headquarters in this small village near the Chechen border is almost empty.
Time is running out, and so is hope of finding Mr.
Cuny and his three-person team.

Mexico's situation will be under continuous review as the future payments are made.


Wimbledon Competitors And Grass Wilt in Heat
The umbrellas were raised today at Wimbledon to perform a very untraditional function: They were used as shields against a burning sun that heated Center Court to a record 110 degrees and fried the lawns of the overused and underprotected outer courts.
The players who couldn't stand the smolder -- like Britain's Shirli-Ann Siddall, who was carried from her mixed doubles match on a stretcher after fainting -- didn't advance.
The players who survived complained of being drained.
And the grass, pampered for 50 weeks but subjected to cruel and unusual punishment for these two, continued to die quietly.

International Briefs; In Brief
*
The Swedish Government yesterday ordered Toys "R" Us Inc. and a union to resume talks next week to seek a resolution in a seven-week strike.
The strike, while affecting only about 150 workers, gained prominence because the company, based in Paramus, N.J., refused to sign a collective agreement, which 25,000 companies have signed and which is at the heart of union influence in Sweden.


Stonewalling for Mr. Gingrich
Predictions that the House ethics committee would be unwilling to address complaints against Speaker Newt Gingrich are turning out to be correct.
Six months into the new Congress -- and coming upon the July 4 deadline its Republican chairwoman, Representative Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, set for disposing of the charges -- the committee is nowhere near resolving the case.
The 10-member committee, equally divided between Republicans and Democrats, has deadlocked along partisan lines on the question of appointing an outside counsel to review the allegations.
They center on the Speaker's book deal and the blurring of lines between his various political and fund-raising organizations and his public office.
Meanwhile, as Adam Clymer of The Times reported this week, the committee's staff has been sluggish about pursuing key testimony.
Many of the most obvious witnesses have not been questioned, and some individuals who have been questioned say they were not put under oath.

Mayor Loses Political Fray In Legislature
The 1995 legislative session ended shortly before dawn today after several demonstrations of the kind of hardball politics that have come to typify the arm-twisting, back-scratching and retaliation of Albany's annual race to recess.
And the primary victim of this year's last-minute wrangling may be the Giuliani administration.
In the final hours of the session, the Legislature passed bills, which Mr.
Giuliani opposed, that would tie the city's hands in managing its Police Department while killing legislation coveted by the Mayor that would have provided property tax incentives for development in lower Manhattan.


Phyllis Hyman Jazz Singer, 45
Phyllis Hyman, a New York jazz singer whose most recent hits included "When You Get Right Down To It" and "Living in Confusion," died yesterday afternoon in Manhattan, a possible suicide, the police said.
She was 45.
An assistant to Ms.
Hyman found the singer unconscious in her bedroom at 211 West 56th Street around 2 P.M., said Det.
Dwight Cunningham, a police spokesman.
She died at Roosevelt Hospital at 3:50 P.M.


By Mozart, Chopin, Debussy And Coral Messina When 9
Coral Messina, a Mexican pianist and composer, played some of her own works as well as a broad selection of standard repertory works in her New York debut recital on Wednesday evening at Weill Recital Hall.
Ms.
Messina has a utilitarian technique, and she tends to prize muscularity over subtlety, an unwise choice in Weill Recital Hall, where very little effort is required to produce a big piano sound.


Silence and Light Are Partners In a Solo for Baryshnikov
Literalists would call Dana Reitz's "Unspoken Territory" a 20-minute solo for Mikhail Baryshnikov.
But the work, which received its world premiere at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival here on Thursday night, is better although more fancifully described as a pas de trois for Mr.
Baryshnikov, silence and light.
Since the 1970's, Ms.
Reitz has filled dances with intricate movements that look like calligraphic messages written on the air.
She has often dispensed with accompaniments and in recent years has collaborated with Jennifer Tipton, who designed the lighting for "Unspoken Territory."


CHRONICLE
While growing up in Jacksonville, Fla., in the 1960's, NAT GLOVER was attacked by white men with ax handles who mistook him for a customer in the segregated cafeteria where he had an after-school job.
Mr.
Glover, who is black, managed to break away and run to safety.
He says a police officer nearby did not intervene.
"I cried that day, because I had run away from a fight," he told The Associated Press.
"I also knew that was no way for a police officer to act."


Man Is Held in Bomb Threats
Jonathon Gill, who officials say was so unhappy about some traffic tickets that he threatened, twice, to blow up the police station, was held on $90,000 bail yesterday after being indicted on the threat charges.
Officers who raided his home said they found three powerful dynamite bombs.


Just 17, a New Father And Knocking on Doors
RAY ALPONTE, who is 17 years old, was running behind schedule as he prepared to look for a job.
For four months, he had worked pushing a handcart in the garment district but he quit in a fit of pride on June 16, which was also the day his girlfriend, Jaylene, gave birth to their baby, a girl named Ashley.
Jaylene, who is 18, lives in Brooklyn with her family.
Ray, who is paying for the milk and Pampers, lives with his family on Stanton Street on the Lower East Side.
"I hope Ray gets something soon," said Isobel Lopez, his mother, as Ray was dressing.
"He wants to do things right."


Strawberry's Line: 5 IBB
Darryl Strawberry walked into a new and unusual form of controversy today when pitchers from Detroit's rookie league Lakeland team in Florida's Gulf Coast League walked the 33-year-old slugger intentionally five straight times, under orders from the Tiger organization.
Strawberry, who was signed by the Yankees 10 days ago and is attempting to play his way into shape for a return to the major leagues by the middle of July, never saw a pitch he could hit in an obvious protest of his presence at the lowest minor league level, one filled predominately with teen-agers.


CUNY Education Means More Than a Degree
To the Editor:
Re your two June 27 news articles on the City University of New York's stricter admissions policy:


For Greece, Olympic Aspiration Is a Reality
Ancient Greeks built the Parthenon, wrote the Iliad and put an indelible stamp on everything from philosophy to battlefield tactics to the city-state.
But the modern Greeks do have at least one edge on their ancestors.
They play basketball.
In fact, they play it very well, and tonight in the quarterfinals of the European championships, they finally earned a spot for Greece in the Olympic Games that their forefathers invented.
They earned it with a 66-64 victory over Spain, and they earned it in a sport that packs in this era's Greek public like Sophocles and Aeschylus used to pack in the ancient one.
"I think the whole country has tears in their eyes right now," Greece Coach Makis Dendrinos said.
There were tears for a different reason six years ago when Atlanta was chosen over Athens to play host to the 1996 Summer Games.
At least now, the Greek basketball stars will not miss out on the Olympic festivities.
Greece will be in fine European company.
The other three teams to qualify for Atlanta tonight were Lithuania, Croatia and Yugoslavia.
The Lithuanians beat the Russians, 82-71, in the first quarterfinal, getting 33 points and 14 rebounds from their imposing center, Arvidas Sabonis, soon to be a Portland Trail Blazer.
The Croatians struggled, but survived to beat the Italians, 71-61, getting 24 points and 10 rebounds from their forward Toni Kukoc of the Chicago Bulls.
Last and most convincingly, the Yugoslavs, who were barred from qualifying for the 1992 Summer Olympics, qualified for Atlanta by dominating a good French team, 104-86, behind 24 points from guard Predrag Danilovic, a future member of the Miami Heat.
In Saturday's semifinals, Lithuania will meet Croatia and Yugoslavia will play Greece.
But it is doubtful that those matchups will generate the emotion of the quarterfinals.
"These were no-tomorrow games," said Croatia Coach Aleksandr Petrovic.
"If you lose the semis, you can play for the bronze. If you lose in the quarters, there is no medal here and no chance for a medal in Atlanta."
The biggest name missing from the Atlanta field will be Russia, which finished second to the United States at last year's world championships with much the same cast and the same coach, Sergei Belov.
But after being upset by Spain in group play, the Russians were unable to lift their game against their former teammates from the Soviet Union.
Although they pulled within 1 point early in the first half, Sabonis and Seattle Supersonics guard Sarunas Marciulionis were too good down the stretch.
"A couple of guys were thinking about new contracts and new clubs instead of the tournament," Belov said.
"This game was a matter of life and death. I'm surprised my players didn't feel this way, and that they don't feel it's a tragedy that a Russian team is not in the Olympics."
For a while, Croatia appeared in danger of experiencing a similar fate.
The team led by only 2 points at halftime and it was hardly encouraging when the left-handed Kukoc had to leave the game midway through the second half after cutting his right hand in a scramble for a loose ball.
But after receiving three stitches, Kukoc returned with two fingers bandaged together and helped Croatia pull away down the stretch.
A surprising fourth in the last world championships, these modern Greeks are now Olympians.
"For us veterans, this is a dream," said the 32-year-old center Panayiotis Fassoulas, who scored a game-high 20 points for Greece.


Citicorp Announces High-Level Personnel Shifts
In a step that rearranges the highest executive ranks of Citicorp, John S. Reed, its chairman, has named top executives to oversee the business areas that the company expects to be most critical for growth.
In a memo distributed in the bank on Thursday, Mr.
Reed named David E. Gibson to supervise the bank's activities in emerging markets.
An executive vice president, Mr.
Gibson, 55, has been directing the bank's activities in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.


Beaches All Set for Holidays
Even with recent thunderstorms, which can send street runoff water into the sea and create spot pollution problems, the ocean off New Jersey beaches is in good shape for the Fourth of July weekend, said David Rosenblatt, a supervisor with the Department of Environmental Protection.
But the water is still cold, in the low 60's.
So far this summer, a one-block section of beach in Atlantic City has been closed twice because of pollution from storm water runoff, Mr.
Rosenblatt said.


U.S. Has Supported Arts From the Start
To the Editor:
Bruce Ellis Fein (letter, June 25), in his rush to rebut Hillary Rodham Clinton's "Arts for Our Sake" (Op-Ed, June 21), forgot -- or was oblivious to -- the long history of United States Government support for art and artists, beginning nearly two centuries before the establishment of the National Endowment for the Arts.


Bolivia Sells Utility to U.S. Companies
Bolivia announced the sale of a controlling interest in its state electricity company to three American companies for $139.8 million, the first step of an ambitious program to transfer ownership of key industries to private hands.
The Government agreed to sell a 50 percent stake in Empresa Nacional de Electricidad to Dominion Energy Inc., a unit of Dominion Resources Inc. of Richmond; Energy Initiative Inc. of Parsippany, N.J., and Constellation Energy, a unit of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company.


Superintendent Is Indicted
As Superintendent of Bergen County's special services school district, James B. Lederer flew extensively around the country, ostensibly to enrich his knowledge of special education.
A county grand jury grounded him yesterday with a five-count indictment, charging him with theft by deception.
Charles R. Buckley, acting Bergen County prosecutor, said Mr.
Lederer, 50, improperly billed the district for more than $21,000 in airline and hotel charges for himself and traveling companions.
Mr.
Lederer -- appointed last September to a state task force to study how schools can reduce costs -- was suspended from his $116,500-a-year district post in December after an investigation by the district.
Mr.
Lederer's lawyer, Paul Brickfield, said yesterday that his client is a scapegoat for a district that never established a policy for expenses.


Financial Services Plan Advances Without U.S.
Leaving the United States isolated after it rejected a global plan for liberalizing trade in financial services, a large group of industrial and developing nations said today that it favored pressing ahead with the plan on its own.
The effort won support from all 15 nations in the European Union, which endorsed it at a hastily convened meeting of ministers here tonight.
It was supported by a number of other nations, including Canada, Switzerland, Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, Morocco and Uruguay.


Mignon E. Nixon, Gregory D. Smith
Mignon Elizabeth Nixon, the managing editor of October, a New York arts journal, and Gregory Douglas Smith, an editor at Warren, Gorham &amp; Lamont, a professional publisher in New York, were married on Friday at the Municipal Building in New York.
Paula Pagan, a clerk of the City of New York, officiated.
Ms.
Nixon, who is 33 and is keeping her name, is also an art critic.
She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University and is a candidate for a doctorate in art history at the City University of New York.
She is a daughter of Judge John T. Nixon and Betty C. Nixon, both of Nashville.
Her father is the Chief Judge of the United States Middle District Court of Tennessee, in Nashville.
Her mother, who was a Nashville councilwoman from 1975 to 1987, is the special assistant for university relations at Vanderbilt University there.


Neuberger Show Reviews Trends in Mexican Photography
To the question, "What's new in Mexican photography?" the American Federation of Arts reponds with "A Shadow Born of Earth," a touring show making its final appearance, through Aug. 6, at the Neuberger Museum at Purchase College.
Elizabeth Ferrer, who serves the Asia Society in Manhattan as both the curator of its gallery and the head of its visual arts department, organized the spectacle, choosing 16 photographers aged 31 to 55.
She also wrote the bilingual catalogue.
Americans expecting poverty, devout catholicism, obsession with death, evidence of oppression but no sign of the oppressors will not be disappointed: Social Realism lives on in Mexican art, though in diluted form.
Still, viewers may be surprised to see signs of the narcissism that, coupled with undue emphasis on technique, bespeaks the condition of entropy known as Post-Modernism.
Though the malaise transcends national boundaries, its progress may well be accelerated by personal contacts with the industrialized countries.
Most of these photographers completed their studies in the United States or Europe.


Ideas &amp; Trends; 'Don't Bother Me: I'm Catching Some Rays'
KELLY MERCEIN knew what she was getting into.
She had heard the horror stories, read the warnings, learned of the possible side effects.
She had even been subjected to daily lectures by her worried mother, who cut out articles from local newspapers and left them in her room.
But if Ms.
Mercein, a 20-year-old college student from East Meadow, L.I., grasped the risks, she was not about to begin living her life in the shadows.
So on a clear day last week, she spread her blanket on the sand, turned her face to the sun and threw caution to the wind, all in pursuit of her guilty little summer pleasure:


Extra Services Give Realtors an Edge
SUCH dismal occurrences as declining numbers of first-time home buyers and a recent drop in house sales would hardly seem the stuff of successful residential real-estate ventures.
Yet, two real-estate-related concerns -- Siderow Associates in Chappaqua and More Than a Mortgage in Katonah -- have been able to increase business substantially by adding special services.
To wit: Last November, when Sheila Siderow started Siderow Associates in Chappaqua, the question she was most often asked was, "Why does Chappaqua need yet another real-estate firm?"

MARKET TIMING
Monday The Commerce Department reports personal income and spending for May.
Forecast: income up 0.1 percent and spending up 0.5 percent.
In April, both reports rose 0.3 percent.
The Commerce Department also reports May construction spending.
Forecast: down 0.6 percent, after rising 0.4 percent in April.
The New York, American and Nasdaq stock exchanges will close at 1:00 P.M. eastern time.
Tuesday John Major faces a Conservative Party vote that will determine whether he will remain Prime Minister of Britain.
Mr.
Major faces John Redwood, former Secretary of Wales, in an election to pick a party leader.
Whoever wins will be Prime Minister by virtue of heading the majority party.
Mr.
Major needs the backing of 165 of the 329 Tory M.P.'s and a margin of 50 votes over Redwood to win outright.
The Fourth of July holiday.
All markets, banks and government offices are closed.
Wednesday The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets today and Thursday.
Analysts say recent strong reports on durable goods, initial jobless claims and new home sales make it unlikely the Fed will lower interest rates.
Thursday The Commerce Department releases leading economic indicators for May.
Forecast: down 0.2 percent.
The index has not risen since December and, after remaining unchanged in January, has fallen every month since.
In the past, three straight declines have often signaled a recession.
The Commerce Department also reports May housing completions.
They fell 7 percent in May, but rose 10.5 percent in March.
Friday The Labor Department releases unemployment figures for June.
Forecast: the jobless rate is expected to inch up to 5.8 percent, from 5.7 percent in April.
But it is estimated the economy will have added 95,000 nonfarm jobs, after losing 101,000 in May.
Few analysts think the report will influence a Fed move on interest rates.


Special Athletes Play Up the True Olympic Ideals
About this time next year, the 1996 Olympians will march into the new Olympic Stadium in Atlanta to mark the centennial of the modern Games.
That group could learn a great deal from the thousands of athletes who paraded into the Yale Bowl last night in New Haven for the opening ceremonies of the ninth Special Olympics World Games.
The Special Olympics are infinitely truer to the ideals of the ancient Greeks than are the regular Olympics.
From that first 200-yard sprint on a sunny afternoon in 776 B.C., athletes and reportedly some 50,000 spectators gathered every four years on the grassy plains of Olympia, Greece, for nearly 1,200 years without interruption by either war or politics.


June 25 - July 1; A Terrorist's Creed
"Take us for example, if we had never done anything violent and had submitted the present writings to a publisher, they probably would not have been accepted. If they had been accepted and published, they probably would not have attracted many readers. Even if these writings had had many readers, most of those readers would soon have forgotten.


If You're Thinking of Living In/Franklin Township, N.J.; Busy Streets and Quiet Country Lanes
MORE than two-thirds open space with vast tracts of farmland and state park land, Franklin Township is one of the largest and most diverse municipalities in New Jersey.
Some streets of the 46-square-mile township are busy thoroughfares that sprawl from the neighboring city of New Brunswick, while others are narrow, winding, wooded, country lanes where deer are often more plentiful than cars.
Single-family housing varies from small, two-bedroom turn-of-the-century colonials on 30-foot-wide lots, all the way up to majestic, 14,000-square-foot mansions set back hundreds of yards from the road.
The least expensive house listed in the township is a three-bedroom, bank-owned, 50-year-old ranch on Millstone Road near the New Brunswick line, offered at $34,900.
Many other homes can be had for under $100,000.


Phyllis Hyman; Jazz Singer, 45
Phyllis Hyman, a New York jazz singer whose most recent hits included "When You Get Right Down to It" and "Living in Confusion," died yesterday afternoon in Manhattan, a possible suicide, the police said.
She was 45.
An assistant to Ms.
Hyman found the singer unconscious in her bedroom at 211 West 56th Street around 2 P.M., said Detective Dwight Cunningham, a police spokesman.
She died at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center at 3:50 P.M., hours before she was scheduled to perform at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.


Elizabeth Hinckley, Robert Foregger
Elizabeth Rodman Hinckley, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Robert L. Hinckley of Southwest Harbor, Me., is to be married today to Robert Cornelius Foregger, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Russell F. Foregger of Waterbury Center, Vt.
The Rev.
Samuel S. Rodman 3d, an Episcopal priest who is a cousin of the bride, is to officiate at the Pot and Kettle Club in Bar Harbor, Me.
The bride, 26, is an environmental geologist for the Johnson Company, an environmental engineering company in Montpelier, Vt.
She graduated cum laude from Middlebury College.
Her father is the president of Hinckley Yachts, a yacht-building company in Southwest Harbor that was founded by the bride's paternal grandfather, the late Henry R. Hinckley.
Her mother, Bettina B. Hinckley, is a yacht charter broker at Hinckley Yachts.


Crossing Safeguards
The city is planning new safety measures for Mulry Square, the treacherous intersection of West 11th Street, Greenwich Avenue and Seventh Avenue.
Under a nine month experiment to begin by the end of the year, corners will be extended by about five feet into curbside lanes.
Crosstown traffic on West 11th Street between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue will be reversed from westbound to eastbound.


June 25 - July 1; I'll Take Manhattan . . . Or Maybe Not
WHAT'S in a name?
When the name is New York, apparently not too much.
Here is the Big Apple, pretty well convinced it is the center of everything, the capital of the world.
But does anyone out there buy it?
Not if you measure its fame by the frequency with which its name is invoked outside its borders.


Denied Play, They Sue The Coach
MANY high school coaches endure complaints from players and their parents, from students and fans, and from sports commentators.
But until recently, it is believed, matters did not wind up in court.
That is, not until John Ceneri, the former girls varsity basketball coach at Hamden High School, was hit with a lawsuit alleging that he caused "severe emotional distress" to three players.
In what is believed to have been an unprecedented action, the three players recently were awarded $13,500 in an out-of-court settlement.
"What this means is that if you cut a kid from now on, they have a way of getting back at you," said Jim Bombaci, a girls basketball coach at Daniel Hand High School in Madison.
The case, in Superior Court in New Haven, never went to trial; a lawyer for the insurance company that represents the Board of Education in Hamden agreed to the settlement.
Mr.
Ceneri, a 37-year-old gym teacher at the Hamden Middle School, says he is unhappy with the settlement, and that he feels it reflects unfavorably on him as a coach.
And many coaches in the state believe that the settlement, along with the lawsuit itself, sets a dangerous precedent.
"It's kind of scary," said Michael Savage, the executive director of the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference, the governing body for high school sports in the state.
"It could encourage other situations of a similar nature in the future."


Heather Rosbe, William Vrattos
Heather Westlund Rosbe, a daughter of Judith and Robert Rosbe Jr. of Marion, Mass., was married there yesterday to William Charles Vrattos, a son of Luanne and George Vrattos of New York.
The Rev.
Robert W. Woodroofe 3d performed the ceremony at St.
Gabriel's Episcopal Church.
The couple, both 25, graduated from Dartmouth College.
Mrs.
Vrattos received an M.B.A. from New York University and is a consultant with the valuation services group at Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm in New York.
Her father retired as a partner in Morgan Holland Partners, a venture capital firm in Boston.
Her mother is a lawyer in Hartford for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.


Hurdles to College Remain; Competitors Have Changed
Dear Editor:
In "Read My Lips," (June 18), Greg Donaldson exemplifies the best and most candid of all the members of academe.
But he is not a pragmatist.
The comparisons relating to the City University student body of the 30's to the 60's are relevant and, for the most part, true.
These young adults from immigrant families worked hard, studied hard and sacrificed everything for the immediate goal of a college education.
The "me generation" had not yet evolved, and all life's niceties were postponed for a chance to attend City College, from which I graduated in 1947.

Let the Mountain Bikers Crash on Their Own Trails
To the Editor:
In his June 18 Soapbox, "The Zen of Mountain Biking," J. P. Partland says he's addicted to mountain biking.
That's great, but does he have to destroy the hiking trails?
He thinks it's O.K. because only a "handful" of hikers are bitterly complaining.
A few thousand is quite a handful.
He compares the soles of hiking shoes to the tires of mountain bikes, but the destructiveness of the latter is far, far greater.
As for Mr.
Partand's contention that "crashing is frequent, but injuries are rare," that statement is not consistent with my professional experience.


Effort to Oust Yeltsin Team Falls Short
The Russian Government averted a political showdown today when Parliament failed to gather the 226 votes needed to pass a vote of no confidence.
Had the measure passed, President Boris N. Yeltsin would have been forced either to dismiss his Cabinet or to dissolve the legislature and hold early elections.
Seconds after the voting ended, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin strode to the podium in what looked a little like a victory lap.
Speaking ingratiatingly, though, he said the vote "has drawn a line through the crisis."


Take a Long Time to Admire Gehrig's Lengthy Feat
The emotion-choked voice of Lou Gehrig echoed throughout Yankee Stadium 56 years ago this Tuesday.
His measured words provided the world of sport with one of its most poignant moments.
They have taken their place with Franklin D. Roosevelt's "Day of Infamy" speech and the broadcast of the Hindenburg disaster.


One Blot on Nelson's Impressive Resume
The game was going back and forth, with the Golden State Warriors holding on to a slim lead at the Charlotte Coliseum.
It was Feb. 9, 1994, and the Hornets were threatening when the marvelous Michigan rookie Chris Webber threw a circus pass away, a pass for which even a schoolyard legend might take criticism.
Don Nelson had had enough.
He tossed aside the gray thatch of hair hanging over his forehead and began firing on all cylinders.
He walked onto the court as timeout was called and yelled at Webber, berating him all the way back to the bench.
Finally, Webber retaliated.


Kim L. Berman, Robert M. Galler
Kim Leslie Berman, the daughter of Marilyn and Irving Berman of Oceanside, L.I., was married last evening to Robert Michael Galler, the son of Eileen and Richard Galler of Port Richie, Fla.
Rabbi Joseph Potasnik performed the ceremony at Temple Israel in Lawrence, L.I.
Mrs.
Galler, 27, teaches special education at Public School 29 in Brooklyn.
She and her husband graduated from Hofstra University, from which she also received her master's degree in special education.


Selective Sympathy
To the Sports Editor:
In "Darryl's Latest Message" (The Times, July 24), Ira Berkow tells us that Darryl Strawberry is pitiable, stupid, arrogant, weak, going to the dogs, drug addicted, guilty of spousal abuse and only knowing how to play baseball and get himself in hot water.


Toll Takers on the Job, for Now
Drivers on the Garden State Parkway were given a temporary reprieve yesterday, as toll takers who voted on Friday to authorize a strike stayed on the job.
But bargaining between the workers, whose contract expired at 11:59 P.M.
Friday, and the New Jersey Highway Authority, which operates the parkway, remained stalled, as it has been since Thursday night.


Dog Owners Should Follow The Lead of the Leashers
To the Editor:
I fully agree concur with Sandy Berger's complaints about some dog owners' irresponsible and often rude behavior (Letters, June 11).
In the East Village, where I have lived with a dog since 1979, we have more than our share of people whose dogs (usually large) are walked off the leash.


Now Playing, 30,000 Feet Up, Some Variety
IT'S WELL INTO THE FLIGHT, and the meal trays have been cleared.
Perhaps it's time for a movie.
The choice used to be either/or -- either you watched the family film that was offered, or you slept.
But today, some airlines are offering a menu of films to satisfy every taste.
Among the choices on individual video screens are classics like "Psycho," foreign films like "La Cage aux Folles" and new movies like "Pulp Fiction" (which shows violence and drug use), "Clerks" (which almost got an NC-17 for language) and "Priest" (the controversial film in which the title character is gay).


Leslie Holsinger, Steven Sanders
Dr.
Leslie Jean Holsinger, a postdoctoral fellow in molecular immunology at Stanford University, was married yesterday to Dr.
Steven Sanders, a research scientist at SDL, a laser research company in San Jose, Calif.
The Rev.
Richard G. Kief, a Unitarian Universalist minister, performed the ceremony at the Mission Inn in Riverside, Calif.
The bride, 30, is the daughter of William and Jean Holsinger of Riverside.
She graduated from Occidental College and received a Ph.D. in molecular biology from Northwestern University.
Her father retired as the property services manager for the City of Riverside.
Her mother, also retired, was an administrative assistant for the Jurupa Unified School District in Riverside.


China Has World's Best Reason to Limit Births
To the Editor:
That the tone of your June 25 front-page article on birth control in China appears to condemn coercion by the Chinese Government to limit births greatly surprises me.
Every society creates laws to limit individual actions that adversely affect the community.
For a country bursting with people, am I to sympathize with the family that chooses six children?

An Overnight Briefcase
Being called a stuffed shirt is one thing; owning a Stuffed-Shirt, a new packing aid for business travelers, is quite another.
The Magellan's catalogue of travel accessories now offers the Stuffed-Shirt, which its makers say allows a traveler to pack a shirt or blouse along with socks, stockings, tie or scarf and carry them in a briefcase.
The product, which is 11 inches by 9 inches and no more than 2 1/2 inches deep, has an internal frame that holds a shirt or blouse snugly.
A separate compartment holds accessories.
Stuffed-Shirt costs $79 with a canvas cover or $129 in leather, plus $6.95 shipping and handling. (800) 962-4943.

Corrections
Because of an editing error, an article and a picture caption last Sunday about a contemporary showhouse named Seascape, which was moved to Madison from Westport, misstated the association of the retailer W. T. Grant with the house.
He did not live in the house in Westport; his estate was in Madison.


When It's Skintight And All Right
People interested in fashion with an edge are wearing mesh T-shirts or muscle shirts that fit like a second skin and dresses that stretch over the body like panty hose.
Many of the clothes are printed in designs that suggest tattooing.
The fabric, a blend of nylon and Lycra, made an eye-catching appearance on the runway at Jean-Paul Gaultier's Paris show two years ago.
On this year's tattoo T-shirts, he printed his portrait and his name (left), as well as images from famous Renaissance paintings (right).

Weiskopf Leads at a Soggy Senior Open
Tom Weiskopf began the third round of the United States Senior Open today at six under par, tied for the lead with Tommy Aaron.
But as he lined up a short par putt at No. 1, loud thunder echoed through the Congressional Country Club and he stepped away.
He had 3 hours 45 minutes to contemplate that putt, while heavy rains soaked the course.


Making A Buyer Aware
STARTING this weekend, potential customers who walk into real estate offices in New Jersey are being asked to select the terms of the relationship they will share with their broker.
Effective yesterday, New Jersey joined 44 other states -- including New York and Connecticut -- that have adopted "agency disclosure" laws for real estate brokers.


All the Comforts of Manhattan; Why Rough It in the Hamptons? Goodies Are Delivered
The Lexington Avenue butcher shop's missive to its Upper East Side clientele was as pointed as its knives.
Can summer in the Hamptons be savored without hung pheasant or designer chicken, liberated from cages and nurtured in the sweet air of Pennsylvania Dutch country?
"We have been informed by many of our valued customers on how 'difficult' it is to purchase quality meats and poultry at the East End while away from Albert &amp; Sons during the summer months," wrote the proprietors, Robert and James Moffa.


Dust Off the Disco Ball: The Fever Rises
Anybody here from New Jersey?" the WPLJ disk jockey Scott Shannon inquired disingenuously. It was a balmy evening in late June, and a few thousand fans had assembled for a concert sponsored by the station and featuring Irene Cara, Vicki Sue Robinson, Tavares, Rose Royce and Alicia Bridges. "Long Island?" he asked. "Westchester?
How about Connecticut?" The Paramount Theater at Madison Square Garden fairly quaked with each bellowed-and-whooped response.
But the decibel level rose for real, and the crowd rose to its feet when a disembodied voice like that of God or Charlton Heston introduced the headliners: "Ladies and gentlemen, the Vil-lage PEOPLE!"

Sniffing and Puffing
STOGIES are not just for old fogies anymore," Kate Paxton of East Hampton said. Miss Paxton, daughter of Tom, the folksinger, is a cigar smoker. "It feels mighty powerful to smoke a cigar," she said.
Last Sunday, Ms.
Paxton, along with 8 other women and 12 men, lighted up at the first Maidstone Arms Cigar Dinner Under the Stars.
Because the stars were not shining -- it was yet another rainy night -- the Dinner Under the Stars was held under fluorescents.
That was not a problem, said Christophe, manager of the Maidstone Arms.
The restaurant-inn in East Hampton is "a cigar-friendly establishment," he said.


Melissa J. Lee, Scott J. Wortman
Melissa J. Lee, a daughter of Madelyn and Stephen Lee of Matawan, N.J., was married last evening to Scott J. Wortman, the son of Gloria Levine of Old Bridge, N.J., and Ronald Wortman of Upper Saddle River, N.J.
Rabbi Henry Weiner performed the ceremony at the Livingston Country Club in Livingston, N.J.
Mrs.
Wortman, 25, graduated from the University of Wisconsin and received a master's degree in education from Rutgers University.
She is a mathematics teacher at the Carl Sandburg Middle School in Old Bridge.


Enduring the Year of the Dust
City construction projects are ubiquitous, necessary and often a nuisance for those stuck living or working nearby.

For Newark Teachers, New Man and New Era
Joseph Del Grosso has been president of the Newark Teachers Union for less than two weeks, but the photos in his new office document his history as a labor activist.
In black and white, they show a young man with long hair and defiant eyes, picketing in a teachers' strike that lasted three months in 1971.
"They are there to remind me which side I am on," Mr. Del Grosso said.


Elisabeth Silver, Scott A. Kratka
Elisabeth Ann Silver, a daughter of Charles and Adela Silver of Aberdeen, N.J., was married yesterday to Scott Alan Kratka, the son of Joseph and Patricia Kratka of Mebane, N.C.
The Rev.

Michael's Church in West End, N.J.
Mrs.
Kratka, 28, is a vice president in the compliance department of Smith Barney, the securities brokerage in New York.
She graduated from Rutgers University and received an M.B.A. from New York University.
Her father, a psychologist, retired from the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in West Orange, N.J.
Her mother is the coordinator of the English as a Second Language program for the public schools in Red Bank, N.J.


Sweet Sweetback's World Revisited
GORE, PROFANITY AND SEX ARE splattered over the screen so routinely today that no movie from the 1970's could possibly match the contemporary Hollywood action film in visceral nastiness, right?
Before agreeing, check out Melvin Van Peebles's 1971 film "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song," which will play at Film Forum from July 14 through July 16.
This sulphurous nightmare of racial paranoia and revenge eclipses even "Reservoir Dogs" in evoking a world of infinite seaminess, injustice and cruelty.

The Predictably Unpredictable Neil Young
IT WAS A SUNNY BUT CHILLY afternoon, and Neil Young was twisting up and down the hilly roads of this rural retreat an hour south of San Francisco in his pristine 1960 Lincoln Continental.
One hand on the wheel, the other near his aching back, he was on his way to his chiropractor's office in San Jose when suddenly the convertible screeched off the side of the road.
Mr.
Young gave the wheel a mighty turn to the left, and within seconds he was on the road again, heading back in the direction he came from.
"There's no way I'm going to make it to San Jose and back here again, especially during rush hour," he said as he accelerated back up the pine-lined mountain road.
"No matter how much you need to do something, sometimes you just have to change your mind. And it's O.K. to change your mind."


Jessica A. Lerner, Daniel H. Pink
Jessica Anne Lerner, a lawyer for the civil division of the United States Department of Justice in Washington, is to be married today to Daniel H. Pink, the speechwriter for Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich.
Judge Lynn Pickard of the New Mexico Court of Appeals in Santa Fe is to perform the ceremony at the bride's parents' house in Santa Fe.
Ms.
Lerner, who is 29 and will keep her name, is a daughter of Alan B. Lerner and Elisabeth W. Lerner of Dallas.
She graduated summa cum laude from Amherst College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and she and the bridegroom received law degrees from Yale University.


The Plebeian Beet Gets the Royal Treatment
BEETS are one of my favorite root vegetables, especially in the summertime.
They add a dash of color as well as flavor to salads and are especially good with game, duck, beef and other dark meats and things cooked on the grill. (They contain a crimson dye called betanin, which stains other ingredients, so I usually toss them in the dressing separately.)
Roasting beets in the oven in their skins is one of the best ways to bring out their flavor.
They can also be wrapped in foil and baked slowly on a grill if they are not put directly on the heat.


QUICK BITE/Point Pleasant Beach; O, for a Draught of Root Beer? Get Thee to Stewart's
Be thirsty, not hungry, when you drive (and drive you must, for the full effect) over to Stewart's Drive-In at the Jersey Shore.
This stand, like most of the 51 other Stewart's stands in the United States (including 36 in New Jersey), harks back to the 1950's, with carhop service and car trays.
Stewart's serves food, but that's not what you're here for.
You're here for the icy, creamy, espresso-brown root beer.
Stick to that, and you'll do no wrong: this bliss in a frosted mug comes plain -- if you can call root beer this good "plain" -- or adorned, as a black cow, gussied up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.


Rogue Trader Is Named In Investment Fund Loss
A 39-year-old trader at First Capital Strategists, a small York, Pa., securities firm, managed for three years to hide millions of dollars in mounting losses in the account of the Common Fund, according to the fund, which holds $20 billion in investments for colleges and other schools.
David K. Storrs, president of the Common Fund, confirmed accounts that Kent Ahrens of York, Pa., a 12-year employee of First Capital, bet that stock prices would decline and then let his losses go unsettled for three years.

Wimbledon Is Overtaken By a Tempest Amid the Tea
Never your average tennis Joe, he pulled down his shorts in Tokyo as a showy act of surrender while being drummed into defeat by Michael Chang.
He grabbed a camera from a bystander in Portugal to take an incriminating snapshot of the imprint left by a ball that sealed a match point against him.
And this afternoon he stunned Wimbledon by throwing a temper tantrum that culminated in his walking off the court.
With this bit of tennis theater, Jeff Tarango, the former Stanford standout, became the first player in Grand Slam history to demand and receive his own deportation midmatch.


Capoeria: Baptism By Back Flip, To a Drumbeat
The room was dark and Gothic; 25 people dressed in white sat on the floor, nervous amid the pounding rhythms of a drum, tambourines and cowbells.
One, Dewane Woodley, a 31-year-old computer consultant for Bell Labs, blew air into his hands, then wiped his sweaty palms, waiting for his turn to be baptized into capoeira, a Brazilian blend of religion, dance and martial art.
Like t'ai chi, capoeira is a martial art that is easily mistaken for a dance form, a confusion enhanced by the musical training involved.
And that was practical; the form originated in the grueling slave world of 17th- and 18th-century Brazil, where it could be taught without alarming anyone.


Doc Pomus, a Poet in Song
WHEN Doc Pomus died of lung cancer in 1991, the music world lost one of its greatest songwriters and one of its most loved citizens.
Pomus, the composer of "This Magic Moment," "Save the Last Dance for Me" and too many more of the best tunes of the past 45 years to list, was a familiar figure in New York nightclubs.
Wheelchair-bound from a childhood case of polio, he was a one-man receiving line for countless admirers and hangers-on.
Born Jerome Felder in Brooklyn in 1925, Doc Pomus wrote lyrics that at their best were tough, wise and sometimes heartbreaking poetry.
An intimate of some of the greatest rhythm-and-blues and pop artists of his time, including Ray Charles and Big Joe Turner, he was larger than life in every sense.


Iris, Lily, William: Flowers Are People Too
SINCE the Fourth of July weekend is meant to be a relaxing sort of time, let's abandon the subjects of pulling weeds and mowing lawns and concentrate on some other activities that are just as important.
Have gardeners ever paused to consider how many of the plants growing in their plots have feminine names?
Take Lily, for example.
There are all sorts of lilies, and they come in all sorts of shapes and sizes -- from lily of the valley to lily turf to Easter lily.
In fact, this clan is one of plantdom's largest.


A Mandala Plan Incites Zulu Rivals
For T. D. Ntombela, one of 300 or so chiefs of the Zulus in South Africa, word that the Government of President Nelson Mandela wants to take over the care and feeding of this country's traditional leaders, or Amakhosi, comes not as welcome news but as a grave affront.
To hear Mr.
Ntombela, who doubles as a member of the legislature in the predominantly Zulu province of KwaZulu/Natal, a chief enjoys both the mandate of heaven and the confidence of his tribesmen, who alone are empowered to remove him.
For all of the seeming generosity of the Government's offer to provide housing and salaries for chiefs, he said Mr.
Mandela should stick his nose elsewhere.


Coloring History Our Way
A FEW MONTHS AGO, IT SEEMED THAT JAPAN AND AMERICA had finally figured out how to finesse the politics of this summer's anniversaries.
For years, officials in Washington and Tokyo had puzzled over how to mark the atom bombing of Hiroshima and end of World War II without stirring the wrath of veterans in Nebraska or nationalists in Nagoya.
After endless meetings, Japanese and American diplomats agreed on a strategy: No big V-J Day events, just an acknowledgment of the sacrifices on both sides.
Then the focus should turn to the "global partnership" that diplomats like to talk about as a counterpoint to the constant bickering between the world's two largest economies.
Like most agreements between Japan and America these days, the details were left a little hazy.
And, like most accords, this one is failing.

Places, Everyone
THE plan for the state's new arts center is to get people -- from the suburbs, from the cities -- off their couches and into the theater and the concert hall.
Bring a center of their own, like Lincoln Center in scope, to people who don't want to schlep to New York City for culture.
And in Newark, a city that more readily conjures up images of carjackings than concertos.
Backers of the $165 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center point out that the brownstone-and-cafe-lined neighborhood around Lincoln Center was once considered one of Manhattan's most dangerous.


An Unjust Report
To the Editor:
"Employee Leasing: The Risks Of Swimming in a Big Pool" (Earning It, June 11) spends far too much time sensationalizing and far too little time on why more than 70,000 small businesses have embraced this rapidly growing industry.


Of Capitalism and its Discontents
APPROPRIATELY enough this Fourth of July weekend, an upbeat blueprint for a business-led reconstruction of American civilization appears for the first time on the business best-seller list.
The book, "Rethinking America" (Random House, $25) by Hedrick Smith, slips in at No. 10.
It shares that spot with a classic in the celebrity book genre, "Everyone's a Coach" (Zondervan/HarperBusiness, $22), in which Don Shula, with the grammatical assistance of Ken Blanchard, reveals the secrets of his winning ways at the Miami Dolphins since he began coaching way back in the Kennedy Administration.
Well, if we can watch ice hockey at the end of June -- and could you ask for a better example of what's wrong with America and capitalism than the owner of the New Jersey Devils? -- we can learn from the cheery Don Shula.
Neither cheery nor American is John Wareham, a headhunter who makes much of his antipodal roots in "The New Secrets of a Corporate Headhunter" (HarperBusiness, $13), the sequel to "Secrets of a Corporate Headhunter." Do not be surprised if you are struck inexplicably by a desire to listen to the cast recording of "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" while reading Secrets II, or Secrets With a Vengeance, as I like to think of it.
Mr.
Wareham has the cool, clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth, if not the upturned chin and grin of impetuous youth.

The athletes paraded around the Yale Bowl, smiling and waving and occasionally blowing kisses to 60,000 strangers.


Monumental Toil to Restore the Magnificent
SHE SPENDS HER DAYS ON HER feet, hunched over an enormous magnifying glass.
She works with a carefully developed selection of cleaning solvents that she applies to paint scales the size of a grain of rice, then removes the congealed grime and dirt with a scalpel.
On a good morning, she may clean an area the size of a half dollar, perhaps uncovering a revealing original detail, perhaps finding nothing.
After 16 years, her eyesight is permanently altered, and a chronic pain pulses through her neck and shoulders.
She has to deal with a constant stream of visiting scholars and critics, some of whom strongly oppose the project.
There are days, even weeks, when Pinin Brambilla Barcilon would prefer to stay home from her job at the Santa Maria delle Grazie convent in Milan, a job she hopes will end in 1997.


A Dash of the Modern Amid Mediocrities
WHERE BETTER TO COME to grips with the struggle between modernism and history than Kyoto?
This city's new concert hall by Arata Isozaki might conceivably exist in Tokyo, or Osaka, or even Frankfurt or Barcelona: it is good enough to hold its own amid the architecture of any of these cities.
But it has particular resonance in Kyoto, where Mr.
Isozaki's implicit theme -- the difficult synthesis between traditional architecture and the modernist style -- is the stuff of daily life.
People who have not been to Kyoto often imagine it as some kind of theme park of traditional Japanese architecture, where the landscape of ancient temples and Zen gardens is broken only by a few elegant hotels and ryokans, or Japanese inns.
In fact, Kyoto is Japan's fifth largest city, and its heart is as full of traffic and noise and garish signs and wretched new buildings as any other place in Japan.
Kyoto also has the most extraordinary array of Buddhist temples and gardens to be seen anywhere in the world, but they must be sought out and are mostly to be found on the city's perimeter.
In the center, the real world of today holds sway.

Because of a computer coding error, the paperback best-seller list on page 16 of The Times Book Review today omits a book.

"Reviving Ophelia" should be No. 3, and each further book should be one position lower; "The Kennedy Women" should be 15th and last.

Consider Lily, Veronica and Creeping Jenny
SINCE this, the July 4 weekend, is meant to be a relaxing sort of time, let's abandon the subjects of pulling weeds and mowing lawns and concentrate on some other activities that are just as important.

June 25 - July 1: Athletes Only; Testing the Usefulness Of School Drug Testing
The Supreme Court's ruling last week that schools can conduct random drug tests on student athletes left many schools wondering where to get the money for testing, what kind of drugs to look for -- and why athletes should be the ones to look at.
School officials acknowledge that the high court had good reasons for making a legal distinction between athletes, who volunteer for a team, and other students.
They agree that athletes serve as role models and may have special safety needs.
But as a practical matter, they said, it would probably make more sense to test students not involved in sports.
"Most of our statistics indicate that there probably would be a lesser percentage of people participating in extra-curricular activities who were involved in recreational use of drugs," said Ralph Swearngin, associate director of the Georgia High School Association.
Many coaches say their athletes are far more likely to use steroids than street drugs.
But while a marijuana test costs $20 or less, a steroid test runs $70 and up.
Even some school officials who support testing say that without enormous parental pressure, they would never choose to spend their tight budgets on urine tests.

The Thin Line Between Mole And Manager
Thirteen years ago, the careers of R. Lindley DeVecchio, an F.B.I. agent, and Gregory Scarpa, a Mafia gangster, became secretly entwined.
Mr.
Scarpa was a prized mole for the Federal Bureau of Investigation inside the Colombo crime family; Mr.
DeVecchio was his contact agent, or handler.
But that relationship has now backfired for the Government, wrecking a major case because of charges by other agents that Mr.
DeVecchio, too, was a mole, providing confidential information to Mr.
Scarpa that helped him to evade arrests and to track down rivals in a mob war.


F.A.A. Rule to Ban Some Children's Seats
A Federal Aviation Administration rule banning two types of child safety seats aboard planes is scheduled to take effect July 9.

The agency did not mandate that children too small for adult lap belts ride in other safety devices -- a rule sought by the National Transportation Safety Board and the flight attendants' union.

Streetscapes/22 West 34th Street; A Startling Modern Work Camouflaged by Retail
THE 34th Street Midtown Chamber of Commerce has been victorious in having the huge County Seat store sign painted over on the old Spear &amp; Company building at 22 West 34th Street.
But although the group has achieved its goal of improving the street, what this unusual early modern building really needs is not paint, but paint remover.
Lewis Mumford, writing in The New Yorker in April 1938, called West 34th "the one really comic street" in New York.
"Here," he wrote, "you will find all the latest fashions promptly embodied and caricatured."


STATES SHELVING AMBITIOUS PLANS ON HEALTH CARE
After Congress killed the Clinton Administration's proposals to revamp America's health care system, ambitious state plans to extend health insurance to more people took on importance as possible models for the nation.
But nearly a year later, most of those plans are dead or stalled as the states turn their attention to cutting budget deficits.
Meanwhile, the number of uninsured people is growing fast.
In Florida, for example, Gov.
Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, had proposed in 1992 that employers be required to provide health insurance for their workers.
Under pressure from large self-insured employers, he quickly withdrew that plan.
Since then, Republicans, who now have a majority in the Florida Senate, have blocked another of the Governor's plans: to transfer $3.2 billion in Federal Medicaid money over five years to a managed health care program that Mr.
Chiles said would cover 40 percent of the state's 2.8 million uninsured residents.


POSTINGS: Exhibition at Equitable Gallery; Impressionists' New York

And a Monet feeling is evoked by a snowy scene in Ernest Lawson's "Stuyvesant Square in Winter" (c. 1907).
These are among 46 paintings that depict the new thoroughfares, skyscrapers, lights, bridges, squares and parks of turn-of-the-century New York and that comprise "The Impressionists' New York," an exhibition of American artists at The Equitable Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue at 51st Street, through July 15.


Advocates Turn Tactics On Leader
For years, the community group Acorn taught its members how to rally, demonstrate and hold sit-ins to get what they wanted.
The group gained wide attention in 1987, when it occupied 30 vacant buildings in East New York and forced the city to turn them over to squatters.
Now, after learning the art of confrontation, some Acorn members are using confrontational tactics against one of their own -- Acorn's head organizer.

Some On-Line Discoveries Give Gay Youths a Path to Themselves

Some of the protesters crowded into the precinct house's tiny lobby, while others milled about on the sidewalk, chanting, praying and clapping.

How Adding One Comma Can Subvert 'Richard III'
To the Editor:
Your article on a junior high school's sequels to "Henry VI" ("The Bards of Brooklyn Bring You Blood, Guts and Wargret," June 11), by wrongly inserting a comma following the word "discontent," completely misinterprets, as many others have done before, the opening lines of "Richard III."
You wrote: "Now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this son of York."


Abortion Foes Eager to Flex '96 Muscle
Only two years ago, they were defeated and discouraged.
But abortion opponents who gathered here this week expressed such eagerness to press their agenda that more than once their leaders cautioned them not to overreach.
Emboldened by electoral victories last year, by the death of Dr.
Henry W. Foster Jr.'s nomination for Surgeon General and by the bright prospects of several Congressional bills to curb abortion, participants at the annual convention of the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest anti-abortion group, said their next targets were President Clinton and political candidates at all levels who favor abortion rights.


On Sunday; Your Party Isn't There; Neither Is She
LAST night was the first in a long time that Carolyn E. Dolan could sleep straight through, eight whole hours of shut-eye if she wanted it, without the bullfrog sound interrupting things.
In her studio apartment on the East Side, with the leather-bound National Geographics on the windowsill and the battleship-gray filing cabinets that serve as a room divider, the telephone does not ring, it snorts, like a lily pad-dweller letting loose a "ribbit."
Until yesterday, when she retired, there were a lot of ribbits at Miss Dolan's: she ran a one-person answering service.
Lately she had about 50 clients -- doctors, restaurateurs, ballet dancers.
At her peak some years ago, she had 300, and somehow squeezed five employees into her apartment.
A Volkswagen Beetle had more leg room.


The World: Electoral Confusion; So Far at Least, Inept Is the Kindest Word For Haitian Democracy
LOOKING at the long lines of Haitians who waited patiently and peacefully for hours under a broiling sun to cast their ballots last week, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide saw "a clear sign of political maturity." Looking at the disorganization that reigned at polling places and in vote counting centers afterward, American election observers from the International Republican Institute saw a complete "national breakdown of the electoral process."
By all accounts, Haiti's first attempt in nearly five years to carry out a democratic vote turned out to be a seriously flawed exercise.
On voting day, hundreds of polling places opened hours late or did not open at all because ballots were not received, while others got ballots with the names of some candidates missing.
Then the count quickly deteriorated, with ballots and tally sheets being scattered about, mixed together, replaced entirely or reportedly altered, and even thrown away as garbage.

Irene Shvakman, the daughter of Lidia Shan of Philadelphia and the late Mikhail Shvakman, was marrried yesterday to Jose Carlos Gonzalez-Seoane, the son of Jose Ramon Gonzalez Ponte and Clemen Seoane Barral of La Coruna, Spain.
Mayor Gerardo Estevez of Santiago de Compostela, Spain, performed the ceremony in the city hall there.
Ms.
Shvakman, 27, is keeping her name.
She is a consultant in the Moscow office of McKinsey &amp; Company, the management consultants.
She graduated cum laude from Brown University and received her M.B.A. from Harvard University.
Her mother is a research chemist for Webcraft Technologies in New Brunswick, N.J.
Mr.
Gonzalez-Seoane, 33, is a founder and the president of Fontenla &amp; Seoane, architects in New York and La Coruna.
He graduated from the University of Santiago and received his master's degree in architecture from Columbia University.
His father retired as a civil engineer at the Bilbao office of Rense, the Spanish railroad company.


The China Problem
China's Prime Minister, Li Peng, was in Moscow last week, urging that Russia and China stand together against alleged American bullying.
Twenty-five years after Richard Nixon courted China to help contain the Soviet Union, China is playing its own version of triangular diplomacy to exert leverage on the United States.
The gambit was further evidence that relations between Washington and Beijing, once the pride of American diplomacy, are profoundly troubled.
It will take a combination of patience and firmness by President Clinton to stabilize the relationship while not sacrificing American interests.
The United States has a clear interest in maintaining good relations with Beijing.
China is a nuclear power, one of the world's fastest-growing economies and home to one-fifth of the world's population.
American companies have invested more than $7 billion there since 1979 and export about $9 billion worth of goods to China annually.
The United States also imports nearly $40 billion worth of Chinese goods, making China America's sixth-largest trading partner.


90's Campers Rough It in a Fiberglass Cocoon
On the ragged coast of one of America's wildest, most remote national parks, Susan Lybarger poked her head out her tent this morning, surrounded by a forest of fiberglass.
Among the last old-fashioned campers, she and her family had bravely staked out two nylon domes in a dusty lot full of three-ton motor homes, converted buses and 40-foot-long vehicles with names like Kountry Comfort.
In the campground of 1995, where an occasional eagle can be seen flying over satellite dishes mounted on trailer roofs, Kampers rule.

A Guide to Researching the History of a Building
IT'S like the weather: Everybody talks about the history of their buildings, but nobody does anything about it.
And why should they?
While historic preservation has become an industry, there is no manual, guidebook or even a list of the commonest sources for local-history research in New York City.
The blind alleys and travel time between archives can discourage even the most dedicated researchers; novices often give up, not knowing how close they may be to their goal.
And so New York's history usually remains a remote, inaccessible idea.
No wonder walking-tour guides get by with outlandish tales.

Rezoning Worries Gay Residents
Mayor Giuliani's proposal to rezone sex businesses in the city is generally associated with closing down the pornographic movie houses and peep shows that clutter Times Square.
But many of the city's gay and lesbian residents are concerned that it will also force the closing of sex-related establishments that they say are key to the identity and vitality of their community.
On Wednesday night, at the Lesbian and Gay Community Center on West 13th Street, nearly 100 people gathered for a forum about the new zoning proposal, which limits sex businesses to manufacturing areas and commercial zones and is expected to initially reduce the number of such businesses to 15 from 177.


Christy A. Ottaviano, Kevin P. Ohe
Christy Ann Ottaviano, a daughter of Marilyn and Mario Ottaviano of Westport, Conn., is to be married today to Kevin Patrick Ohe, a son of Jacqueline and Paul Ohe of Cincinnati.
The Rev.
Terrence Baum is to officiate at the Roman Catholic Church of St.
Agnes in Brooklyn.
The couple, both 28, work at Henry Holt &amp; Company in New York, a publishing company where the bride is an assistant children's book editor and the bridegroom is an assistant reference book editor.
They received master's degrees in English literature from Boston College.
She graduated from St.
Michael's College and is a candidate for a master's degree in education at Columbia University.
He graduated from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.


London Living, Under a Camera's Icy Gaze
MIKE IS HAVING A HARD time adjusting to life in London.
Wearing a baseball cap that seems glued to his head, he slouches into a snack bar and peers suspiciously at the food behind the glass.
"What's a tom?" he demands, jabbing at one of the sandwich signs.
"It's a tomato," responds the clerk, who by now must heartily hate Mike, and possibly all Americans.


Susan Webb and Robert K. McCabe
Susan Meek Stocker Webb and Robert Karr McCabe were married yesterday in the American Cathedral of Paris.
The Very Rev.
Ernest E. Hunt, the Dean of the cathedral, performed the Episcopal ceremony.
Mrs.
McCabe is a daughter of Mrs.
Samuel W. Meek of Greenwich, Conn., and the late Mr.
Meek, who was a vice chairman and director of international operations for J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency in New York.
The bride attended Vassar College.
She was a widow.


The Park Bench Is Leaving the Park Behind
BE THEY EXTRAVAGANZAS IN wrought iron or ever so humble conceptions in wood and cement, park benches offer more than places to sit.
Thanks in part to a gardening boom and the 1994 film "Forrest Gump," they are being appreciated far from public parks -- on suburban lawns, patios and even in the parlor.
Vintage benches -- from parks, gardens and stadiums -- look great anywhere, says Martha Stewart, today's Emily Post of home style.
Ms.
Stewart was in the vanguard of decorating with benches in the 1980's, using them both outdoors and inside her homes in Connecticut and on Long Island.
Nothing spiffy, mind you; the more rustic, the better.
"They can be chipped and worn," she says, "but they must never feel like that. Old benches must be waxed and buffed so there are no rough edges unfriendly to sitters."


Hilary J. Binda and Cary S. Honig
Hilary Janine Binda, the daughter of Margaret Smith Churchill Binda of Washington and H. Jeffrey Binda of Chevy Chase, Md., is to be married today to Cary S. Honig, the son of Dorothy and Dr.
Arnold Honig of Little Neck, Queens.
Rabbi Emily Matthis is to perform the ceremony at the Casino in Roger Williams Park in Providence, R.I.
The bride, 29, was until recently the English coordinator at School One, an alternative high school in Providence, where the bridegroom, 37, is a teacher of English and physical education.
In the fall, she is to begin studying for her Ph.D. in English at Tufts University.
The couple graduated from Brown University.
The bridegroom received a law degree from Harvard University and a master's degree in teaching from Brown.


Britain's Future (and Major's) at Stake
The Conservative Party's leadership election on Tuesday, in which Prime Minister John Major has staked his future, is not just about who will lead the party.
It is also about which direction the party should take -- toward or away from further integration into Europe.
The vote will turn on many other questions, including the length of Mr.
Major's coattails in a general election, but the subtheme is a debate that has bedeviled political parties here since Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973.

Reach Out and Subsidize Your Favorite Cause
SEVERAL months ago, Rich Ciacelli Sr. received yet another plea to switch long-distance services.
The only difference was that this one came not from MCI or Sprint, but from a conservation group of which he was a member.
The mailed solicitation said that he would get lower phone rates and that his group, the Michigan United Conservation Corps, would get a contribution if he began using Frontier Communications International, a fast-growing long-distance carrier in Rochester.
Mr.
Ciacelli, a retired Ford Motor worker and an avid duck hunter in Monroe, Mich., said he liked the idea that by telephoning his daughter in Tennessee, he could help his local conservation group.
So he abandoned AT&amp;T.


Monitoring the North Brooklyn Muck: Watchdog Steps In
Deborah Masters has her work cut out for her.
In her new role as a local environmental monitor for the city, she will be responsible for keeping tabs on Greenpoint and Williamsburg, two areas that have long had more than their share of toxic woes.
It is an area where industry abuts residences, companies work with hazardous chemicals, a massive oil spill has seeped under the streets, and a project to clean the Williamsburg Bridge spewed lead dust into homes.
And there is proliferation of waste-transfer stations, temporary dumps where trash is held before being sent to landfills.


Union Stops Work at a Breakaway Hotel
More than 200 waiters, bellhops, clerks and other unionized employees struck a luxury hotel on the East Side of Manhattan yesterday in a bitter contract dispute that forced guests to run a gantlet of screaming pickets and left managers scrambling to carry luggage, serve food and make beds.
As visitors poured into New York City for the long Fourth of July weekend, the walkout at the 550-room Drake Swissotel at Park Avenue and 56th Street was an annoying inconvenience for 330 guests, who hurried past whistle-blowing, placard-toting pickets into the relative serenity of the wood-paneled, marble-and-mirror lobby.


A Prep School of Their Own
The Upper East Side is home to many of the city's best known private schools, like Brearley and Dalton.
But not all parents in the neighborhood can afford to send children to them -- nor are they satisfied with the choice of public high schools.
While school is out for the summer, a group of residents will spend the vacation months pressuring city school officials to create a small local high school offering college-preparatory courses with high academic standards.


Where Rusticity and Elegance Mingle

Mechants of Debt
ON Wall Street, a small army of computer jockeys keeps busy culling mounds of market data in search of hidden treasure.
Using complicated statistical models, these quantitative analysts, or quants, try to sniff out undervalued securities, profitable currency plays and the like.
Here, on Kearny Street, the quants at Providian Bancorp are busy, too.
Their computer screens are sifting a different kind of data, about the borrowing habits of credit card users.
But their quarry is just as rich a trove as Wall Street's: middle- and lower-income consumers who want, or need, to borrow a lot of money and are the least inclined to shop for the best terms.


Christina Haage, David Rowntree
Christina Mary Haage, a daughter of Joseph and Phyllis Haage of Reading, Pa., is to be married today to Dr.
David Cedric Rowntree, the son of Peter and Dr.

Ms.
Haage is a vice president of the Boston Company, an investment services firm, in Boston.
She graduated from Northeastern University.
Her father retired as the director of guidance counselors at Reading High School in Reading.
Her mother retired as a legal secretary for Ryan, Russell &amp; McConaghy in Reading.

Manager Shot in Robbery at Supermarket
A manager at a crowded Upper West Side supermarket was shot twice in the chest yesterday as he struggled with an armed robber who had taken two bundles of money from a cash register, the police and store officials said.
The gunman, armed with a .380-caliber automatic, walked into the Sloan's supermarket at 88th Street and Broadway at about 4 P.M., as three cashiers were working their way through long lines of customers.
He demanded money from the manager, Cesar Pellerano, 32.
Mr.
Pellerano handed over an unknown amount of cash, Officer Robert Samuel, a spokesman for the Police Department, said.
But as the robber was leaving the store, Mr.
Pellerano chased him and the two fought, Officer Samuel said.


Miss Goldstein, Rabbi Fogelman
Ahuva Goldstein, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Jacob Z. Goldstein of Brooklyn, was married on Thursday to Rabbi Mordechai Fogelman, a son of Rabbi and Mrs.
Hershel Fogelman of Worcester, Mass.

Mrs.
Fogelman, 22, teaches the seventh and eighth grades at the Yeshiva R'tzahd, a boys' school in Brooklyn.
She graduated from Beth Rivkah Teachers College in Kfar Chabad, Israel, and in the fall will resume her studies at Brooklyn College.


Orange County's Threat to Us All
A great many local governments are going through fiscal crises this year, but only one -- Orange County, California -- has actually filed for bankruptcy.
The latest blow to the county came when voters in this very wealthy area rejected a modest sales-tax increase that was essential to averting insolvency.
Orange County is not broke, however.
It is simply refusing to pay its debts because voters remain in the thrall of their anti-tax ideology.
Their arrogance is roiling the bond markets and threatening to raise interest rates for governments everywhere.
Certainly Orange County voters have a right to be incensed at the failure and incompetence of their leadership over many years.
But when the county treasurer, Robert Citron, invested county funds in high-risk derivatives that yielded rich dividends and avoided the need for a tax increase in the county, nobody was complaining very much.

IN BRIEF
Lawyers May Be Fined For Filing Frivolous Suits
The State Supreme Court took a serious view of frivolous law suits last week.
It called upon the court system's Civil Practice Committee to come up with a new rule that could levy fines or other kinds of monetary penalties on lawyers found guilty of filing such suits.

Reporter's Notebook; With Skepticism and Tax Cuts for All
As they pushed their budget plan through the House and Senate on Thursday, Republicans insisted that they could cut taxes by $245 billion over the next seven years and still balance the budget by 2002.
One Republican after another pointed to the agreement that none of the tax cuts would go into effect unless the Congressional Budget Office certified this fall that the overall plan, including the lower taxes, would lead to a balanced budget in seven years.

Corrections
An article on June 4 about hotels in Stockholm incorrectly characterized the Malardrottningen, a yacht that is now a hotel.

There were at least eight larger yachts at the time.

Food Takes a Cafe Beyond Fun and Games
NIGHTCLUBS are for fun, not food.
Serious diners steer clear of them.
It is not unusual to find mediocre or inferior fare and exorbitant prices at restaurants that emphasize entertainment.
The Borderline Cafe in Brookhaven is best known as a weekend comedy club, not for its cuisine.
The rest of the time this roadhouse at 2647 Montauk Highway (286-8077) promotes everything but its cooking, including karaoke, backyard volleyball games, a piano player and jazz.


The Nation: Gavel Rousers; Farewell to the Old Order in the Court
THE birth struggle of a new era is not a pretty sight.
It is messy, it is unstable, it is riveting.
It was the Supreme Court during the 1994-95 term that ended on Thursday.
An ascendant bloc of three conservative Justices with an appetite for fundamental, even radical change drove the Court on a re-examination of basic Constitutional principles.
Long-held assumptions about the authority of the national government, the relationship between Washington and the states, and the ability of the Federal Government to take race into account in making public policy were all placed on the table for dissection.
Some precedents were overruled, others sharply limited in a gaudy show of zero-based jurisprudence.

Books to Refer to for Problem Plants
Which plants are thriving in your garden and which are not?
The origin of a plant is the key to its needs, so look up a problem plant in some good reference work like "Herbaceous Perennial Plants" by Allan M. Armitage (Varsity Press, 1989) or "Perennials for American Gardens" by Ruth Rogers Clausen and Nicolas H. Ekstrom (Random House, 1989).
"Annuals for Connoisseurs," by Wayne Winterrowd (Prentice Hall, 1992), is a great guide for interesting annuals.
Plant seeds of perennials like yarrow, coneflowers and butterfly weed, and biennials like hollyhocks and foxglove now, so the seedlings will have time to grow into sturdy plants by fall.
Choose a seedbed protected from the blazing sun, and keep it moist, to help seeds germinate.

Neuberger Show Reviews Trends in Mexican Photography
To the question, "What's new in Mexican photography?" the American Federation of Arts reponds with "A Shadow Born of Earth," a touring show making its final appearance, through Aug. 6, at the Neuberger Museum at Purchase College.
Elizabeth Ferrer, who serves the Asia Society in Manhattan as both the curator of its gallery and the head of its visual arts department, organized the spectacle, choosing 16 photographers aged 31 to 55.
She also wrote the bilingual catalogue.
Americans expecting poverty, devout catholicism, obsession with death, evidence of oppression but no sign of the oppressors will not be disappointed: Social Realism lives on in Mexican art, though in diluted form.
Still, viewers may be surprised to see signs of the narcissism that, coupled with undue emphasis on technique, bespeaks the condition of entropy known as Post-Modernism.
Though the malaise transcends national boundaries, its progress may well be accelerated by personal contacts with the industrialized countries.
Most of these photographers completed their studies in the United States or Europe.

China Has World's Best Reason to Limit Births; Shanghai Real Estate
To the Editor:
"Shanghai's Neo-Capitalists Find Real Estate" (front page, June 24), your analysis of a phenomenon that is gripping many Chinese cities -- not only Shanghai -- is insightful but incomplete.
You neglect the fact that the vast majority of real estate agents promoting and profiting from this property boom are not private, but are intimately connected with the government authorities or are themselves state employees.


Pamela M. Pearce, Barre W. Littel
Pamela Manche Pearce, the director of events and publicity at the PEN American Center, the international writers organization in New York, was married on Thursday evening to Barre W. Littel, a financial executive.

The bride, 48, graduated from the Tobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers and Empire State College.
She is the daughter of Lorraine Pearce Friederich of Glen Ridge, N.J., and the late John Stephen Pearce, and the stepdaughter of Albert Friederich.


Corrections
An article on May 21 about kayaking and mountain biking in South Carolina included an outdated reference to the outfitter operating from the property of Middleton Place outside Charleston.

In One Hotel, Exception Proves the Rule
David Liederman owns the Broadway Grill, a nonunion restaurant in the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, a union hotel.
He pays waiters $3.15 an hour, as opposed to the union wage of $6.70 an hour.
His average kitchen employee makes about $20,000 a year, perhaps $6,000 less than what the equivalent union employee would make at another hotel.
Because he is not bound by union work rules stipulating that certain tasks be performed only by workers in specific classifications, Mr.
Liederman can keep his staff to a minimum and their schedules flexible.
He has 34 employees, mostly part-time workers who do not qualify for overtime.
Labor is about 30 percent of Mr.
Liederman's total operating costs, instead of the average of 72 percent in New York City hotel restaurants.
As a result, he said, he runs a profitable business while saving the hotel the $600,000 or so a year it would spend to pay workers if it ran the restaurant itself.

The Nation: Gavel Rousers; On Race, It's Thomas v. an Old Ideal
Of the Supreme Court's paramount decisions this century, one stands out as virtually a sacred American text.
It is Brown v.
Board of Education, which annihilated the moral and legal justification for segregation with the ringing phrase, "Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."
Now, 41 years later, a Justice of the Supreme Court has voiced misgivings about that central insight of Brown.
That would be remarkable enough, given the decision's stature.
Even more remarkable, that Justice is Clarence Thomas, the Court's second black member.
And in one more surprise, the critique of Brown by the Court's most conservative Justice owes much, whether knowingly or not, to a line of anti-Brown scholarship with respectable intellectual roots in the political left.

A Spiritual Leader Lives On in Memory
Beneath yesterday's overcast sky, a stream of Jewish boys and men, unable to drive because it was the Sabbath, walked past the brick houses and well-tended lawns of Cambria Heights, Queens, to the grave of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the spiritual leader of the Lubavitch Hasidim.
Onlookers unfamiliar with the sect's Old World traditions stared at the hundreds of men in black overcoats and fedoras as they passed on their way to Montefiore Cemetery.


Sports of The Times; The Slap Heard 'Round The World
MIXED doubles took on a new meaning at Wimbledon yesterday.

She specializes in the overhead smash.
The Tarangos became instant history on a previously quiet first Saturday at these hallowed grounds.
Never before has a husband walked out of his third-round singles match, alleging a feud with the umpire, leaving behind his wife, a nonplayer who did her very best to slap the man in the chair, Bruno Rebeuh.


Israel and P.L.O. Miss Goal On Finding Self-Rule Accord
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization raced the clock on Saturday in a struggle to reach an agreement on expanded Palestinian self-rule, but were unable to settle all their differences to meet a July 1 target they had set.
Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, and Shimon Peres, the Israeli Foreign Minister, met through the night in the Gaza Strip, but there was no announcement of a settlement as their talks stretched for hours into early today.


A Land of Tussie-Mussies And Midnight Pumpkins
DOWNTOWN -- Connie Berry, a member of the special events committee of the community garden at Sixth Street and Avenue B, is Martha Stewart with an edge.
She doesn't just plan her events.

Last year, for example, she organized an anthropology lecture with a "shrunken-head-making workshop" (which ended unfortunately when the apples used as heads were attacked by fruit flies).
This month, a few weeks after a garden "yodelthon," Ms.
Berry will be producing Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra," starring local pets.


June 25 - July 1: Jailed Dissidents; China's Strong Arm Throws A Punch at the U.S.
For Americans, Harry Wu may very well be the Scarlet Pimpernel of China.
The Chinese-born human rights activist spent 19 years in Chinese prison labor camps, then moved to the United States and transformed himself into an undercover human-rights investigator who penetrated the Chinese camps.
He was detained by Chinese border authorities nearly two weeks ago as he crossed into China from Kazakhstan (with a legal American passport and current visa), and has been held without access to American consular officials.
In addition, Chen Ziming, a dissident whose release from prison last year was personally requested by President Clinton, was jailed again last week.
Branded as one of the "black hands of Beijing" for his role in the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989, he had spent five years in prison before his release for medical treatment.
Although the detention of the two men seems to be motivated primarily by China's preoccupation with internal security, it signals that the United States will continue to pay for its decision to allow President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan to make a private visit to the United States last month.
The American side has insisted that it wants to embrace Beijing.
But President Clinton's decision last week to lift a ban imposed last year on fish and wildlife imports from Taiwan is bound to be read in China as just another punishment.

Ellen L. Marx, Christoph Zeyen
Ellen Lisa Marx, a daughter of Andrew and Sheila Marx of Trumbull, Conn., was married yesterday to Christoph Zeyen, a son of Friedrich-Otto and Hildebrund Zeyen of Kiel, Germany.
The Rev.
Yves Nolet, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at Notre Dame de la Cambre in Brussels.
The couple are associates at the law firm of Akin, Gump &amp; Strauss in Brussels.
The bride, 33, graduated from Wake Forest University.
She received her law degree from the University of Copenhagen and a Doctor of Laws degree from Duke University.
The bridegroom, 36, graduated from the London School of Economics and received his law degree from the University of Kiel.


Habitats/Sullivan Street; SoHo Home With Remembrances of Owners Past
SARA PRICE perched on the edge of a desk, a weathered black-and-white "sea bass" sign -- with "flounder" on its other side -- hanging from a beam above her head; on the walls on either side were dozens of her vibrant oil-on-paper paintings of nudes.
Ms.
Price was sitting in the ground-floor studio of her three-story house on Sullivan Street in SoHo, a house full of the eccentric touches of its previous owners, who liked to salvage materials and incorporate them in sometimes bizarre ways.


[ APPEARANCES ] ; MADE IN THE SHADE
My friend Sigrid Burton, a painter who lives in SoHo, had a melanoma removed last summer.
A melanoma, of course, can be lethal, but when, as in Sigrid's case, it's caught early (before it spreads), the rate of cure is 93 percent.
Since melanoma is related to sun exposure, Sigrid decided to avoid suntanning as much as possible.
She vowed to cultivate an "interestingly pale" look, which was fine for winter.
But now that summer's come, and she is commuting to the Hamptons on weekends, she's been talking about her "pasty" face and "doughy" thighs.
I was worried that going pale was affecting Sigrid's self-esteem.
Her inner child happens to be a California girl who used to slather herself with baby oil and iodine to achieve the proper bronzed goddess effect.
When I suggested using a sunless tanning lotion, she was dubious.
"You mean that stuff I used when I was 13 and I came out in orange streaks?" I said I thought they'd improved it recently.
I'd heard good things along the beauty grapevine.


Bars Don't Stop Flow of Drugs Into the Prisons
Elliot Crespo Jr. was a small-time heroin hawker in Brooklyn until he was arrested twice in late 1989 on the same block in Williamsburg.
Then he became a small-time heroin hawker in a cell block at the Marcy Correctional Facility in upstate New York.
To feed his new market in prison, Mr.
Crespo relied on the wiles of visitors from home.
His male friends smuggled in drugs hidden in the heels of sneakers, he said.
And his female friends passed small balloons filled with heroin from their mouths to his when they kissed in the visiting room.
He then swallowed the balloons or hid them in body cavities.


Consider Lily, Veronica and Creeping Jenny
SINCE this, the July 4 weekend, is meant to be a relaxing sort of time, let's abandon the subjects of pulling weeds and mowing lawns and concentrate on some other activities that are just as important.
Have gardeners ever paused to consider how many of the plants growing in their plots have feminine names?
Take Lily, for example.
There are all sorts of them and they come in all sorts of shapes and sizes -- from lily of the valley to lily turf to Easter lily.
In fact, this clan is one of plantdom's largest.


New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks
WHAT A PIECE OF WORK I AM: (A Confabulation) By Eric Kraft.
Picador USA, $11.
Fiction builds upon fiction as the author's perennial narrator, Peter Leroy, relates the life of Ariane, the make-believe sister of his make-believe childhood friend.
"Eric Kraft's true theme, the awesome power of the low-tech human imagination, has never seemed so timely or so wise," Karen Karbo said here in 1994.
HARRIET BEECHER STOWE: A Life By Joan D. Hedrick.
Oxford University, $15.95.
When Abraham Lincoln was introduced to the author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," he is said to have remarked, "So you're the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war!" Harriet Beecher Stowe was indeed short -- less than 5 feet -- but she had a moral strength and intellectual talent that went beyond the sentimental piety of her most famous novel.
Last year our reviewer, E. L. Doctorow, called this Pulitzer Prize-winning biography "a classic . . . engrossing, capacious, definitive and never straying too far from its sources." The emancipation of American slaves was a Beecher family cause, explored in THE STRUGGLE FOR EQUALITY: Abolitionists and the Negro in the Civil War and Reconstruction, by James M. McPherson (Princeton University, $14.95).
The author demonstrates that the abolitionists, who supported civil rights for blacks out of conviction rather than expediency (they considered Lincoln too timid), achieved more than is usually thought.
This is an "excellent book," C. Vann Woodward said in these pages in 1965, with "something new and vital and relevant to say." Princeton has also restored to print THE ABOLITIONIST LEGACY: From Reconstruction to the NAACP ($14.95), Mr.
McPherson's study of the movement's descendants.
In 1976 one critic found it "carefully conceived, thoughtfully argued and well written."


CHATTER: Public and Private; Privatize, but Carefully
Privatization of many services like the D.M.V. can be done well if government offers it on a franchising basis, subject to very demanding standards and periodic renewal.
The renewal would be given only if the agency met standards agreed between it and the state.
DEWEY P. CLARK Madison


Spanish Park to Guard Endangered Species
Most of the Cantabrian mountain range known as Picos de Europa, in northern Spain, has been converted into one of Europe's largest national parks in an effort to save endangered species that include the brown bear and a wild bird known as the capercaillie that have already vanished from most of Western Europe.
The Spanish Parliament approved the creation of the 160,500-acre Picos de Europa National Park in May, expanding the existing 40,000-acre Covadonga National Park in Asturias into two bordering provinces, Leon to the south and Cantabria to the west.
A master plan framework will be drawn up within a year to define the type of activities that will be permitted in the park.


EVIL'S BACK
Ron Rosenbaum's "Staring Into the Heart of the Heart of Darkness" (June 4) was superb.
From my Baltimore catechism days, we learned to examine our behavior with three questions: Was the act a grievous matter, was it given sufficient reflection and did it have full consent of the will?
What went into the confessional depended upon the answers.

SUNDAY, July 2, 1995; WEATHER: Twister Jargon
Just as weather-watchers got used to terms like the dew point and lake effect snow, here come the "gustnadoes." The word is storm-chaser jargon for whirling winds that come up rapidly, usually without warning.
In form, gustnadoes are similar to tornadoes, but skinnier and slower.
They look a bit like the little twisters that can be seen around the edges of buildings, but they can whirl at 20 to 100 miles per hour and tear the roof off a house.


Small Pleasures That Cool the City's Big Heat; Slow Boats and Fast Boats: Easy Ways to New Worlds
HOW to to explain the city's oven-style summers?
Think of passive solar heating: heat collects in materials like cement, stone, asphalt, brick, then floods back out when the air around it cools.
New York City might as well have been designed for maximum heat retention.
But if the heat is inevitable, it's not inescapable.
Just get near a passive environmental refrigerator, like a river or an ocean, which stays 10, 20, even 30 degrees cooler than, say, an unshaded sidewalk.


Q. &amp; A.
Spraying Against Insects Q Can you please tell me if the concept of "quiet enjoyment" includes the right to refuse to have pest-control people invade and spray poisons in one's apartment without clear prior evidence of significant infestation?


Royal Glassware On View in Copenhagen
An exhibition of nearly 500 pieces of glassware owned by the Danish royal family is on view in the Royal Silver Chambers of the Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen.
The exhibits, created in Denmark, Norway, the Czech Republic, Germany and France, span four centuries and include a large goblet belonging to Frederick II in the mid-16th century and a glass service presented to Queen Margrethe II and Prince Henrik on their silver wedding anniversary in 1992.
Highlights of the exhibition include 18 vases and goblets, never before displayed, by the 19th-century glass artist Emile Galle in a cabinet that was also designed by Galle.


Yosefa M. Lebeau, Dov A. Nelkin
Yosefa Miriam Lebeau, a daughter of Beverly and Rabbi William Lebeau of New York, is to be married today to Dov Adam Nelkin, a son of Carol and Stuart Nelkin of Houston.
The bride's father is to officiate at the Ramaz School in New York.
The bride, 22, and the bridegroom, 23, graduated magna cum laude in May from Brown University.

On Britten's Ground, Fresh Generation
THE CANE-BACKED wooden chairs in Snape Maltings, the Aldeburgh Festival's acoustically miraculous concert hall, are exact copies of the seats at the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth, Germany.
In other respects, too, Aldeburgh, founded by Benjamin Britten in 1948, resembles Bayreuth: it is the legacy of a strong-willed composer who wished to insure the authentic presentation of his works.
In Britten's final years, Aldeburgh was notorious for Wagnerian intrigues.
After Britten's death, Michael Tippett spoke witheringly of a "mausoleum atmosphere."
Traces of that atmosphere remain, but Aldeburgh has changed much in recent years.
The buoyant presence of Oliver Knussen, who directs the festival with the Britten specialist Steuart Bedford, has made all the difference: Aldeburgh is now a 20th-century music festival of wide scope and generous spirit.
Last month, the strongest spotlight fell on two living composers, one from Finland and one from England.
They made powerful impressions as separate personalities, and together they told a heartening story of a younger generation's increasing independence from compositional dogma and polemics.


Banking Law Keeps an Industry Down
To the Editor:
Re "Bigger Banks, Bigger Problems" (Op-Ed, June 28): John W. Moscow, in his defense of the Glass-Steagall Act, cites the precarious state of Japanese banks as evidence that the United States regulatory framework is superior.


Cindy L. Cohen, Darren M. Wallis
Cindy Lisa Cohen, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Stanley Cohen of Brooklyn, is to be married today to Darren Marc Wallis, a son of Mrs.

Rabbi Gerald Weider is to perform the ceremony at the Hotel Intercontinental in New York.


Gay Black Men Find Uptown Hangout in Low-Key Berlin
If you didn't know it was there, it would be easy to pass right by a sign that appears on Friday nights at Papa Charles's Dinner Theater, home of wedding receptions and banquets.
And most people along 125th Street do.
But for those in the know, the glowing yellow sign that says "Berlin" is the welcome mat for another, quieter social world.
Berlin is a 9-month-old dance club that has drawn gay black men from around the city.


First Half Will Prove a Tough Act to Follow
SIX months ago, most Wall Street strategists were pretty sure that if good things happened this year -- and back then expectations were decidedly modest -- they would happen in the second half.
So much for that forecast.


Cheats Like Us
AFTER YEARS OF BITTER debate, New York City this week starts fingerprinting people who apply for welfare benefits.
Depending on whom you've been listening to, this is either a long-overdue attack on welfare cheats or one more petty insult to the downtrodden.
I've been following the debate closely, mainly because it's a strange and revealing controversy, but also because, as a former welfare cheat, I feel a small personal connection to it.
I went on the public dole 20 years ago while hanging around New Haven during a semester off from Yale University.
On the theory that full-time employment would interfere with my attempt to find myself, I was scraping by with a part-time job.
Like so many other Americans -- farmers, military contractors, retirees in Palm Beach -- I had no trouble looking myself in the mirror and thinking: You deserve this money from the Government.


Urban Life's an Endless Parade. Stoops Are the Grandstands.
HE'D picked his stoop some time that morning, before the heat got so bad most people had to hurry inside to find a spot of shade.
But even as it blazed, Richard E. didn't mind the sun.
"Don't feel no pain," he said, dapper in black loafers and a striped shirt, "because hell is gonna be hotter than this. This is just a little taste of it. God is good."


For the Sake Of Harmony
In announcing on Friday night that labor leaders had agreed on $600 million in concessions, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani seemed to have secured a large part of the cash he needed to balance New York City's budget -- at least on paper.
But the deal includes assumptions and agreements that could unravel later, putting the budget and the city's already shaky bond rating at risk.
Even as he trumpeted the deal as a landmark of union cooperation, the Mayor did not say how he would come up with the $160 million difference between the total figure and the $440 million in savings, largely from health and pension costs, that he and the unions jointly announced.


Ardsley Country Club Marks 100th Year
THE more things change, the more they remain the same.
That could be the motto of the Ardsley Country Club, which began centennial celebrations on June 10 and 11.
The membership plays tennis and golf, swims and attends social events much as it always has at this impeccably manicured site overlooking the Hudson.


At Rikers, Guards Watch for Weapons but Shrug at Drugs
Rikers Island, the largest jail complex in the country with thousands of inmates, visitors and staff coming and going each day, is a veritable laboratory for drug-smuggling technique.
Last Dec. 9, four glassine envelopes of heroin were discovered in a magazine sent to an inmate.
The next day, 10 marijuana cigarettes were found in a condom hidden in a visitor's ponytail.
On March 24, a small amount of heroin was found behind a postage stamp on a letter sent to an inmate.
The same day, a visitor, while being searched, "took a balloon from his underwear and swallowed it."


BEHIND THE WHEEL/Oscar Mayer Wienermobile; Some New Tricks for an Old Dog
COMPANY cars are often staid, middle-of-the-road family sedans painted an innocuous shade of brown or appliance white.
For 59 years, the Oscar Mayer Food Corporation has given that concept a twist with its Wienermobiles, a fleet of promotional vehicles that are more mobile amusement parks than basic transportation.
The meatpacker, which has been running its Wienermobiles since 1936, has redesigned the curious car for 1995.
Five of the new vehicles are on the road now, and a sixth will go out later this summer.
The new model comes with such up-to-the-minute touches as a video monitor, a 27-inch TV with VCR, a separate air-conditioner for the rear of the vehicle, citizens' band radio and a public address system.


In Jersey Journal Labor Fight, Publishing Giant Has All the Cards
In many ways, the story seems to have all the elements of a major drama: a family business with deep roots in the community, locked in a contract dispute with a labor union.
But when the family business is a $13 billion publishing empire and the union is one of New Jersey's two remaining, and increasingly irrelevant, newsroom unions, the story assumes a grim familiarity.


Trio of String Quartets in Recital
AFICIONADOS of string quartets are in luck this week.
Three top-notch ensembles are performing, starting this afternoon with the St.
Petersburg Quartet at Music Mountain.
The ensemble has an 8 P.M.
Thursday concert at Wesleyan University, then returns to Music Mountain next Sunday afternoon at 3.
Founded 10 years ago by postgraduate students at what was then the Leningrad Conservatory, the quartet changed its name as the city did.
Laureates at the first Shostakovich String Quartet Competition in 1987, the players have chosen that composer's Seventh Quartet as the centerpiece of their Music Mountain program this afternoon, surrounding it with the D minor Mozart (K. 421) and the Schubert "Trout" Quintet, the latter with Alvin Brehm, double-bassist, and Michael Boriskin, pianist.


David M. Monroe, Scarlet A. Anauo
Capt.
Scarlet Antoinette Anauo, a daughter of Adeline Schneiderhan of Grand Blanc, Mich., was married yesterday to Capt.
David MacDonald Monroe, the son of Paula and Roland Gail Monroe of Brooklyn.
The Rev.
Nicholas Yuschak, an Eastern Orthodox minister, performed the ceremony in the Camp Geiger Chapel at Camp Lejeune, N.C.
The bride, 32, and the bridegroom, 30, are both United States Marines, stationed at Camp Geiger, where she is the commander of the headquarters and service company of the School of Infantry and he is the executive officer of the school's training battalion.
The bride is a graduate of the University of Washington.
The bridegroom graduated from St.
Francis College in Brooklyn.


SUNDAY, July 2, 1995; FRONTIERS OF MARKETING: Next Year, a Stove Of a Different Color
Here are some of next year's colors, according to the Color Marketing Group, an association of 1,400 color designers representing businesses as small as Vermont Castings (wood-burning stoves) and as big as the Ford Motor Company.
Since the designers are essentially predicting what they themselves will be doing, the colors they pick do indeed show up on all sorts of consumer products.
Among the colors to expect in 1996 is Highway.
As a designer puts it, "This solid, stable gray stretches across the country from east to west." The selection of which colors will saturate the marketplace is not supposed to be guesswork, but a result of study and discussion.
One result of this study was the conclusion that "the improving economy has sparked a rebirth in consumer optimism." That, of course, is reflected in Red Haute.
The group also noted "a growing interest in all aspects of nature, the garden, vegetable colors and dyes, rocks and minerals, water and sky." Thus, the prediction that a "rich, complex mineral gray" known as Wet Clay will be popular.
And then there's the continuing trend toward "multiculturalism and ethnic diversity" seen in 'Round Midnight.
This jazzy black is supposed to have a blue (did they mean "blues"?) undertone.
Lest anyone get too optimistic about the direction society is taking, one of the commercial colors forecast for 1997 (and not yet available to show here), is Alligator Alley, a blackish green that "reflects the core of society as an urban combat color."


Remember Growing Pains?
This bull market may not be the best ever, but it is one of the most painless.
The exciting news for American stock owners is that in the first half of 1995 share prices advanced across the board, with the Standard &amp; Poor's composite up 18.6 percent, not including dividends.
But the most remarkable aspect of that is the smooth way in which it happened.


CHATTER: Public and Private; No More Patronage Mills
The D.M.V. should absolutely not be privatized.
Until Governor Kean, field offices were in private hands and the division was nothing but a political patronage mill.
That's what Governor Whitman wants to turn it back into.
The Whitman administration has conceded that it has asked Republican county chairmen to nominate candidates to head D.M.V. agencies in their counties.
That's patronage, pure and simple.

Baseball Has Double Standard
To the Sports Editor:
Despite Mickey Mantle's drug addiction (alcohol was his drug of choice) for over four decades, the coverage of his illness, a direct result of his addiction, has been entirely sympathetic.
This is as it should be, but it's unusual in a culture that has turned extremely nasty and punitive toward most drug addicts, treating them like criminals and encouraging cops, not doctors, to make home visits.


Bruce Hlibok, 34, A Broadway Actor And a Playwright
Bruce Hlibok, a deaf actor who played on Broadway, died on June 23 at his home in Jersey City.
He was 34.
He died of pneumonia, his family said.


Colombia's Rebels Grow Rich From Banditry
At age 68, Manuel (Sureshot) Marulanda's aim may be getting a little shaky.
But the lifelong guerrilla commander's instinctive answer to the latest peace offer by Colombia's President was bombs and bullets.
When President Ernesto Samper Pizano unveiled a peace plan in May, Mr.
Marulanda and other guerrilla leaders responded with an offensive that killed 157 people and wounded hundreds.
Guerrillas kidnapped 35 people, blew up oil pipelines seven times, exploded a bomb in Colombia's Congress building, and destroyed a peace statue created by Fernando Botero, the father of Colombia's Defense Minister.


Where Nature and Sculpture War for Primacy
AT Grounds for Sculpture here, art that previously lay in wait for visitors now gives the impression of advancing on them.
Mostly, it is a matter of the display's having grown denser, thanks to the present show, culled from the Philip and Muriel Berman collection.
Besides that, there has been a shift in the balance of power: nature, molded into a setting for art six years ago, is beginning to compete with it.
Birds are everywhere, taking the place for granted (I witnessed a plover angrily dispatching a rabbit that had come too close to its progeny), and the vegetation is asserting itself, though not without human aid.


Sports of The Times; Rickeyisms Still True In Baseball and World
HE couldn't hit or throw.
As a catcher for the St.
Louis Browns, he set a major league record for allowing the most stolen bases in a game, 13.
But he could think.
As the front-office brain behind the St.
Louis Cardinals and the Brooklyn Dodgers half a century ago and more, his teams won eight pennants and three World Series.
He died in 1965, but his words endure now between the covers of "Branch Rickey's Little Blue Book: Wit and Strategy from Baseball's Last Wise Man" (Macmillan, $14.95).


Lots of Thrills and Spills And Little In Between
AS if climbing the big hill on a roller-coaster ride, investors in the Oberweis fund may be getting some heart flutters.
The fund is soaring, but only after a few dismal years.
And anyone who has followed its tracks knows just how volatile it can be.


For a Touch of Color and Flavor in Risotto or Salad, Add Beets
BEETS are one of my favorite root vegetables, especially in the summertime.
They add a dash of color as well as flavor to salads and are especially good with game, duck, beef and other dark meats and things cooked on the grill. (They contain a crimson dye called betanin, which stains other ingredients, so I usually toss them in the dressing separately.)

The Rev.
Dr.

June 25 - July 1: Cuba in Flux; An Exiled Castro Foe Asks to Return
The Cuban exile leader Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo told Fidel Castro last week that he would like to take his Miami organization, Cambio Cubano, to Cuba as an opposition political party.
In doing that, experts in Cuban affairs say, Mr.
Gutierrez Menoyo was asking for something that goes against what the Cuban Government has always considered key to its survival -- unity.
Still, Mr.
Gutierrez Monoyo, who was a guerrilla commander in the revolution before turning against Mr.
Castro, insisted that his 10-day visit to Cuba, and a private audience with Mr.
Castro, implied hope for a more open political system.
Many in the exile community were skeptical; some called Mr.
Gutierrez quixotic and others, determined to bring down Mr.
Castro by sanctions or force, labeled him a traitor.
Senior Clinton Administration officials, on the other hand, saw a positive sign.
President Clinton reaffirmed his support for the American trade embargo against Cuba, but said the United States would respond "with our own calibrated response" to real political and economic reform.

Small Pleasures That Cool the City's Big Heat; Reading List: Old, New, Borrowed and Blue-Chip
CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT
Summer is a time for escape.
At least that is the usual thinking on what to read when the days are long and the sun is hot.
But for the reviewer, who can read for escape any day of the year, the leisurely days of summer are a time to sink your teeth into something more substantial: Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past," if you haven't read it lately, or Tolstoy's "War and Peace," if you never finished it.


Off Broadway Prize Winner Ushers in Official Season
SUMMER theatergoers have one more week to ponder a get-together of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and Warren Harding in "Camping With Henry and Tom" by the playwright Mark St.
Germain.
The prize-winning play, fresh from an Off Broadway run, can be said to kick off the summer since the opening of Westport Country Playhouse traditionally marks the season's beginning.
For sure, Ivoryton and Gateway's Candlewood Playhouse in New Fairfield opened for business earlier in the year.
Still, this is Westport's 65th summer season, so let others get a jump on the calendar.
It takes Westport to make the summer season official.

Foreign Affairs; Return Mail
So this letter comes in the mail the other day from Newt Gingrich.
It says: "Dear Thomas L. Friedman, Your name was forwarded to me by one of our Republican field directors. I was told that you have a record of being very supportive of Republican politics. I am writing you personally because, as the new Speaker of the House, I need your help. I need to hear directly from you what you, as a loyal Republican, feel should be the priorities of our new Republican Majority in Congress."
Well, Mr.
Speaker, since you've asked . . .
First of all, whoever that field director was who gave you my name as a loyal Republican definitely should not be appointed head of the C.I.A. when you become President.
I don't think intelligence work is his strong suit.
Court jester, maybe.


PHOTOGRAPHER'S JOURNAL


A Day in the Life of Central Park
JUNE 17 was the first Saturday of city summer, a week early by the calendar, but tell that to the weather -- warm and close, a blue sky going pale by late afternoon -- and its concomitant siren song to human nature, making people antsy and irresistibly beckoning them outdoors in loose (or little) clothing.
It is on days like this, paradoxically, that Manhattan streets seem less congested than usual, and that the city itself has an empty, or at least a manageable feel.
Of course, the summer-house season has kicked in, and the weekend hordes have left their normally swarming thoroughfares to tourist buses and their sidewalks to people in brand new Big Apple T-shirts craning their necks at the skyline.


June 25 - July 1; The Right Stuff Was More Fun in the Movie
It was the antithesis of Apollo 13.
Despite real danger and high stakes, the coupling in orbit of an American space shuttle and a Russian space station came off without a hitch last week.
The union of more than 200 tons of metal hurtling about the earth at nearly five miles a second was so flawless that even old space hands were amazed.
They predicted that the feat would give new momentum to the joint ambitions of the Russian and American space programs.
The failed mission of the Apollo 13 moon probe in 1970 was high drama, so much so that it is now a pulse-quickening movie.
By contrast, the 10 astronauts aboard the space shuttle Atlantis and the Mir space station quickly settled into a pedestrian routine of biomedical research and cargo transfers.


Feet, Not Purple; Message, Cryptic
For the last six months or so, they have been appearing on the streets of the East Village and beyond: two meandering sets of painted footprints, one red and one green.
The footprints, laid out by an anonymous group of four artists, lead to the Bowery Bar, the nine-month-old restaurant currently very popular with New York scene-makers -- and very unpopular with some local residents protective of the area's industrial roots, as is clear once you come across the slogans dotting the red path: "Boycott the Bowery Bar"; "Don't Party on the Poor."


Corrections
Because of a computer malfunction, an illustration appears erroneously on page 8 of the Long Island Weekly today with the Home Clinic column.
Wallboard, the subject of the drawing, will figure in the column next Sunday.


Visitors to Spanish Steps Can Look but Not Sit
LET'S just assume, as millions of tourists do every year, that the Spanish Steps are the heart of Rome, and not just an 18th-century stairwell of spectacular grace and Baroque beauty, leading from the Piazza di Spagna up to the convent at Trinita dei Monti.
And so imagine the general consternation at the announcement one day this spring that the steps would be closed off for repairs from May 16 to Christmas -- in other words for an entire tourist season, this in a year when thanks to the low fortunes of the Italian lira, Italy is expected to be flooded by foreign visitors.

My City Island Years
WHEN I lived on City Island, my next-door neighbor used to confide that even after having lived there for most of his 60-odd years, he never stopped getting a certain satisfaction from crossing the City Island Bridge on his way home from work every day.
I knew exactly what he meant.
For a City Islander returning from the mainland -- or "off island," as the old-timers insist -- the bridge is a welcoming hand that guides you across Eastchester Bay and back to your emphatically un-city-like world of boat yards, antiques shops, seafood restaurants and peaceful residential streets.


Really, How Old Is That House Anyway?
A TRIP around the historic town of Essex with Donald L. Malcarne is a trip back in time, but how much time is sometimes seriously in doubt.
"See the sign on that house?" Mr.
Malcarne said, pointing out a tidy marker noting that the house was built circa 1750.
Now "circa" does mean "about," but by a span of nearly a century?
"That house wasn't built until 1840," Mr.
Malcarne said.


Wolfman Jack, Raspy Voice Of the Radio, Is Dead at 57
Wolfman Jack, the rock-and-roll disk jockey whose unmistakable raspy voice and on-the-air howls brought him something of a cult following as one of America's best-known radio personalities, died yesterday at his home in Belvidere, N.C.
He was 57.
The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter, Joy Renee Smith.

Commercial Property/Toxic Sites; Fears of Future Liability Scuttle Many a Deal
IT started off as an all-too-common 90's story: A machine tool business went under, so its bank foreclosed and put its warehouse up for sale.
The warehouse was in good shape and in an accessible Connecticut location.
But the bank wanted the property off its books, so offered it at a bargain-basement price.
There was, however, a big problem: The warehouse had kept machine oil in vats, some of which had leaked.

At the Pillow, a Debut And a Homecoming
THIS TUESDAY MARKS THE debut of the Batsheva Dance Company, Israel's premier contemporary dance troupe, at Jacob's Pillow in Lee, Mass.
But for Ohad Naharin, the group's artistic director since 1990, Batsheva's five-day American visit is a homecoming of sorts.
The 43-year-old Israeli-born choreographer spent 12 years in New York, studying briefly at the Juilliard School before starting the Ohad Naharin Dance Company in 1980.
"It was just a group of pick-up dancers," Mr.
Naharin said the other day, speaking from Tel Aviv.
Still, the experience helped him hone the theatrical, emotion-rich choreography that has raised Batsheva's profile and has made him a hot guest choreographer with companies like the Netherlands Dance Theater.


Happy  [ ]  Day to You
SRINGTIME IN THE HEARTLAND, AND THE funky fertilizer truck hurtles down a narrow country lane.
A spaniel yaps in its pungent wake.
Hawks glide over this 254-acre farm a half-hour northeast of Kansas City, Mo.
And beside a small pond, two poets write of love.
Jim Howard is rangy, intense, tussling with the west wind for the pages of his yellow pad.
Across the water, his lover is restless, scribbling fitfully.
She is a small, curly-haired brunette with a disposition bright as her name: Penny Krugman.
This past February, the newly engaged couple appeared on Tom Snyder's "Late Late Show" under this darn cute premise: valentine writers in love.
By way of introduction, Snyder honked: "Wonder who writes those sappy valentines? Hawwwwwwww."


Patricia E. Thomas, Jeffrey B. Wilson
Patricia E. Thomas, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
John Thomas of Atlantic City, was married on Friday to Jeffrey B. Wilson, a son of Leonard and Annette Wilson of Cambria Heights, Queens.
The Rev.
Robert Johnson, a Baptist minister, performed the ceremony at the Madison Hotel in Madison, N.J.
The bride is a lawyer for Associated Aviation, a litigation management company in Short Hills, N.J.
She graduated from Rutgers University, and she and her husband received law degrees from Howard University.
The bride's father is the chairman of the Urban League of Hudson County in Secaucus, N.J.
He retired as the deputy director of constituent services for Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey.
Her mother, now retired, was a special-needs instructor at Burnet Elementary School in Newark.


Six Flags in L.A. Adds a Water Park
The 24-year-old Six Flags Magic Mountain theme park in Los Angeles has recently acquired a new next-door neighbor, Six Flags Hurricane Harbor.
A water park, Hurricane Harbor has a tropical jungle setting, with water slides, raft rides, wave pools and water play areas.
The side-by-side family entertainment sites make up a new amusement park complex called Six Flags California.
The parks share an entrance road and parking lot, but each requires separate admission.
Entrance to Hurricane Harbor is $16; $10 for children under 48 inches tall and adults 55 and older.
Children under 2 are admitted free.


Four Elements Tangle In Volatile Lockout Mix
The National Basketball Association lockout is no garden variety work stoppage.
For one thing, the lockout is not canceling games or disrupting training camps because there are no games to be played or training camps to be held.
For another, this is not the basic, easy-to-understand management versus labor confrontation sports fans have come to know and detest.
It's the mix of adversaries that takes the N.B.A.'s first work stoppage beyond the experiences of its fellow professional leagues.
This unique conflict pits (1) a large group of dissident players against (2) their union leadership and other players against (3) management.


Parks Aren't Filled, but They're Not Any Emptier
Major league baseball, two months into a major estrangement with its fans following a long and bitter strike, is still staggering with a 20 percent falloff in attendance.
Still, says Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, although baseball has not come close to resuming its boom times of the early 1990's, it has taken at least one baby step back from the abyss.


Karen L. Blinder, Robert Popper Jr.
Karen Lewis Blinder, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Richard Blinder of Montclair, N.J., was married yesterday to Robert David Popper Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Popper of Princeton, N.J.
Rabbi Burt Aaron Siegel officiated at the Women's Club in Glen Ridge, N.J.
The Rev.
Richard Nelson, a Roman Catholic priest, took part in the ceremony.
Ms.
Blinder, who is 34 and is keeping her name, is an associate at McCarter &amp; English, a law firm in Newark.
She graduated from Mount Holyoke College, and she and her husband received law degrees from Northwestern University.
Her father is a partner in Beyer, Blinder, Belle, an architectural and planning firm in New York.


TAKING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION APART
Nowhere was it mentioned in your article that long before there was a law to help minority students, there was an unwritten agreement that the sons of alumni and of prominent or wealthy people were almost always admitted to the college where they applied.
Test scores were not even an issue.

Frederick M. Supper, Business Adviser, 78
Frederick M. Supper, the former chairman and owner of the Alexander Proudfoot Company, a management consulting firm in West Palm Beach, Fla., died on Sunday at his home in Palm Beach.
He was 78 and had suffered from emphysema, family members said.
Mr.
Supper joined Alexander Proudfoot in 1949, when it was in Chicago and had only 10 employees.
He bought the firm in 1970 from the founder's estate, and built it into a worldwide organization, with offices in Europe, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.
By 1987, when Mr.
Supper sold the firm to British investors, it had more than 1,000 employees and $150 million in annual revenues.

The Stanley Cup: A Devil of a Time in New Jersey
SATURDAY The party begins, above, at the Byrne Arena in East Rutherford.
The New Jersey Devils sweep the Detroit Red Wings to claim the National Hockey League championship trophy, the Stanley Cup.
The Party Moves to the Glenpointe Marriott in Teaneck for a party given by the team's owner, John McMullen.
Devils players lived in the hotel during the championship series.
SUNDAY Shortly before 3 A.M. the cup arrives at the Verona Inn, left.
Bar owners receive permission from the Verona Town Council to stay open for a private party for the players.
At 9 A.M. the party breaks up at the Verona Inn and a team employee, Thomas Shine of Jersey City, is entrusted to return the trophy to the Devils' administrative offices.
He first makes stops at a bakery and several taverns in Jersey City and Bayonne.
Mr.
Shine and the trophy visit a Bayonne fire station where, below left, a firefighter, Ted Rowe, places his 7-month-old daughter Ashlyn in the cup.
Mr.
Shine returns the trophy to the team's offices.
MONDAY Devils players, right, pour a cup of coffee from the trophy during a brief appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman.
WEDNESDAY The cup, left, is the focal point of the Devils' official victory celebration in the parking lot of the Byrne Arena.
The trophy makes a special entrance to the party, arriving by helicopter.
Twenty-five thousand fans gather to watch the players tour the parking lot in convertibles before joining their families on a giant stage.

Who Is Rejected For Car Rental
IN the three years since Hertz started the practice of screening renters' driving records, the situation has changed radically.
Alamo, which last year began checking the records of drivers from seven states and the District of Columbia, abandoned that policy on May 23.
Hertz and the other major rental-car companies, moving in the other direction, are screening drivers from an increasing number of states, while fine-tuning their criteria for rejection.
Hertz, which began with New York State, for example, is now screening drivers from 10 states and the District of Columbia; Connecticut is the latest addition.
In fine-tuning, some restrictions have been eased, notably ones involving accident records.
But rules involving major violations are tougher: Avis and Dollar both want to screen out drivers who in the six previous years were convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled drugs.
Avis will also reject a driver whose record shows a conviction at any time for leaving the scene of an accident or possession of a stolen vehicle.


IN SHORT: FICTION

In War With Geese, Most Towns Are Losing
The population of strapping, vociferous Canada geese has grown steadily in New Jersey since the 1970's when thousands stopped migrating from Canada to Florida and the Caribbean and chose instead to settle in the comfortable suburbs here and in Connecticut and New York.
Paul Castelli of the state Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife estimates New Jersey's current number at 60,000, and says it is doubling every six or seven years.
Some people admit a fondness for the geese, encouraging them to stay by feeding them.
Others are anxious to see them go, complaining that they are noisy, cause traffic problems and pollute parks, beaches and golf courses with their droppings.


Swordplay the Serious Way
"A HIT, A VERY PALPABLE HIT!" cries the courtier Osric during the climactic duel of "Hamlet." And in the Broadway production now at the Belasco Theater, those hits are palpable indeed.
Productions of "Hamlet" are often distinguished by verse speaking or physical design.
Jonathan Kent's current staging, imported from the Almeida Theater Company in London, offers an additional virtue in the face-off between Hamlet (played by Ralph Fiennes) and Laertes (Damian Lewis).
Beginning on a white rectangular fencing mat, the fight soon spills beyond it, weaving among the chairs of Claudius's dismayed court as the two combatants become increasingly fevered.


The Biggest Heat Wave In Years Stuns Irish
The Irish, who live in one of the rainiest countries in Europe, have been enjoying, and suffering, the biggest heat wave to descend on this island in years.
For 10 days, the sun, normally invisible in Irish skies for most of the day, week, month and year, has been producing temperatures in the high 80's, and there have been a few unofficial readings matching the 1976 record of 91 degrees.
That would not be remarkable in Rome or Paris.
But in Ireland, which gets 225 days of rain annually, this weather has become a national preoccupation.


Greenburgh Again Says No to Budget
VOTERS in Greenburgh's Central 7 School District apparently did not like the revised $32.9 million budget that was presented for their approval on June 21 any better than they did the $33.2 million budget they rejected on May 3.
Although the revised budget represented an effort to address voters' concerns, it was defeated by 1,100 votes to 739.
Residents also spurned a proposition that would have contracted out school bus transportation to a private Yonkers company by a vote of 1,021 to 721.


Women's Bridge Teams Vie to Play for U.S.
Four star-studded teams of women bridge players began a semifinal contest here this afternoon that will send two of them to represent the United States in world championship competition in Beijing in October.
Half the players involved have previously won world titles.
A team including Jacqui Mitchell and Federal Judge Amalya Kearse of Manhattan, who won the World Women's Pair title in 1986, scored 64 percent in heading the qualifying stage, which ended on Friday.
After 16 deals of their 64-deal semifinal, they led by 15 imps against a dark-horse squad from Seattle.


For a Touch of Color and Flavor in Risotto or Salad, Add Beets
BEETS are one of my favorite root vegetables, especially in the summertime.
They add a dash of color as well as flavor to salads and are especially good with game, duck, beef and other dark meats and things cooked on the grill. (They contain a crimson dye called betanin, which stains other ingredients, so I usually toss them in the dressing separately.)


PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS
PROSPECT PARK A Dance to History: Africans in Early America
In a depiction of the experiences of Africans in early America, the dancer-choreographer Andrea Woods and the composer-musician David Pleasant will perform selections from Mr.
Pleasant's "Ballad of a Black Cowboy," on Friday as part of the Celebrate Brooklyn Festival.
The piece follows the experiences of blacks through forced labor, agricultural work and the struggle for freedom as black cowboys in the American West.


Reworking Under-Bridge Plans
For two decades, plans to put restaurants and shops under the vaulted arches and gracefully tiled anchorage of the Queensboro Bridge have been defeated by community opposition and financial difficulties.
Now, there's a new proposal. But once again, it is facing opposition.


Of Cabbage Whites and Monarchs
Thousands of nature lovers have fanned out across the United States and Canada for the Fourth of July butterfly count.
The counting actually spans six weeks, in different places on different dates, starting officially June 10.
Its purpose is to track and observe, not capture and collect.
Binoculars are in order.
Nets are not.
Butterflies exist all over the world, from the high Himalayas to the depths of Death Valley to the frozen tundra north of the Arctic Circle.
There are thousands of species -- great spangled fritillaries, eastern tiger swallowtails, cabbage whites, painted ladies, you name it.
New York City alone has more than 80 species.
But nowhere is there greater variety than in the tropical rain forests.


A Joyful Noise
It has been 30 years since Mississippi's brutal collisions with the civil rights movement, and with the future.
DELTA TIME: Mississippi Photographs (Smithsonian, cloth, $65; paper, $29.95) depicts -- sadly, sweetly and always with power and intelligence -- how the state's past continues to inform its present.
From 1989 to 1992, Ken Light, a documentary photographer whose previous books include "To the Promised Land" and "With These Hands," traveled among the black poor of rural Mississippi.
His photographs are in the Social Realist tradition of Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans.
Many of his duotone images -- from a haunting study of baptisms in Coahoma County to a powerful vision of a worshiper at a church in Tutwiler -- bear witness to a joy and dignity undimmed by privation.
His subjects observe the ceremonies of black life, sometimes in sadness, sometimes with a joyful noise you can almost hear.
Mr.
Light is never heavy-handed; there are no overwrought contrivances.
These faces, these lives are best served unadorned, as their own eloquent testimony to life in these hard times.

Rediscovering, and Discovering, Leonard Shure
IN THE SUMMER OF 1957, GILBERT Kalish, then a young pianist at the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont, asked his mentor Rudolf Serkin to recommend a teacher.
Mr.
Serkin told him to return to New York and study with the great pianist and teacher Leonard Shure.
Mr.
Kalish had never heard of Shure, a fact that in retrospect "shows where Shure was at that time in the public perception of a young pianist," Mr.
Kalish said the other day.
Other aspiring pianists at Marlboro that summer -- Alan Mandel, Jerome Rose and Alicia Schachter -- posed the same question to Mr.
Serkin and got the same advice, which all of them followed.
Leonard Shure died at his retirement home on Nantucket in late February, six weeks shy of his 85th birthday, and the larger classical-music public is still relatively unaware of him.
A series of Shure recordings from the late 1970's, planned for CD release by Audiofon, may finally bring his significance as an artist to attention.


Orchestra Contract Called a Step Toward Parity
WITHIN the next few weeks, the musicians of the Westchester Symphony, which has just completed its first season as a unionized orchestra, are expected to sign a new one-year contract.
The orchestra's management has offered the players a 20 percent pay increase on an expanded schedule of concerts, a move that Joel Warren, executive director of the Westchester Symphony, said represents a "generous growth step" toward parity with similar ensembles of freelancers in the county and Manhattan.
But the new contract, which the musicians say also represents gains in other areas, may not quell the controversy that arose last year when Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians agreed to let the Westchester Symphony pay its players far less than the usual freelance rate, in order to help the 70-year-old orchestra survive its transition from an avocational to a professional group.


Devils Heading to Washington
No one knows whether the Devils will be in New Jersey or Nashville next season, but the 1995 Stanley Cup champions announced yesterday that they are packing their bags for a trip to Washington next week.
As talks aimed at keeping the Devils in New Jersey continued this weekend between team officials and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the Devils said they had been invited to the White House on July 10.


Debating the Character of West 72nd Street
Once, not so very long ago, West 72d Street between Central Park West and Columbus was a residential block like most on the Upper West Side, except wider.
Aside from a few first-floor doctors' offices, the only discernible commercial enterprise on the street was an obscure Chinese restaurant off the lobby of a building called the Ruxton.
But in just the last few years, the block has undergone something of a transformation, with three restaurants opening and another one apparently on the way.
And some community residents and local politicians have grown increasingly concerned that the block's residential character is at risk.


Poor Brits
To the Editor:
Where is the Anti-Defamation League of Great Britain when we need it?

EVIL'S BACK

Consider Lily, Veronica and Creeping Jenny
SINCE this, the July 4 weekend, is meant to be a relaxing sort of time, let's abandon the subjects of pulling weeds and mowing lawns and concentrate on some other activities that are just as important.
Have gardeners ever paused to consider how many of the plants growing in their plots have feminine names?
Take Lily, for example.
There are all sorts of them and they come in all sorts of shapes and sizes -- from lily of the valley to lily turf to Easter lily.
In fact, this clan is one of plantdom's largest.


Other Methods, Other Madness And Always Slings and Arrows
John Barrymore claimed to have played Hamlet on a London stage while dead drunk.
And to have received rave reviews for it.
Sir Laurence Olivier played the role so well in his 1948 film version that he became the only performer in Academy Award history so far to direct himself in an Oscar-winning performance.
Actors in every generation have used the role of the melancholy, semisuicidal, possibly insane, possibly incestuous young Danish prince to establish their greatness or at least their credibility as serious actors.
And lately, it seems, a number of actors with movie careers have joined the throng.
Here are some of those who have stepped into the role in recent years, with varying results, as the critics have observed.
ANITA GATES


DIARY
DIPLOMACY Trade War, the Mini-Series Relax.
You can have your Lexuses.
The United States and Japan brought their tariff-rattling spat to a close last week with a predictably dramatic 11th-hour deal.
But this mini-drama somehow left viewers unsatisfied: weak tea when strong coffee had been promised.
With portentous huffing and puffing, the Administration had vowed, in Phil Gramm's words, "a gunfight at the O.K. Corral" -- nothing less than a historic cracking-open of Japan's notoriously sealed markets.
But the agreement that emerged was deliberately ambiguous: no specific Japanese commitments on opening its markets, nothing enforceable.
As one American trade expert put it, "We talk loudly and carry a tiny stick." LAWSUITS Now, Let Investors Beware The flood of legislation that's swamping this nation is clearly a mess, and many people, in response, indulge in an age-old reflex: blame the lawyers.
That reflex is surely behind the drive to discourage shareholder lawsuits -- a battle that has inundated innocent civilians lately with a barrage of advertising.
Brokers and accountants, emboldened by the Republicans strutting their stuff, have pushed for a law to limit lawsuits, saying many suits are frivolous.
Consumer groups have countered with ads cautioning that small investors would be left with little recourse if they were duped.
But anti-lawyer fever is clearly strong these Republican days, and last week the Senate approved the measure with a veto-proof 70-29 vote.
INSIDER TRADING Too Tempting to Resist If the money's lying there, they will take it -- whether it's theirs or not.
That seemed to be the lesson last week when a former Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore senior associate, and his brother, pleaded guilty to insider trading.
There is a lot of money lying around these days -- in the form of advance information about the current flurry of mergers.
And cases of insider trading are growing in tandem.
Until now Cravath had prided itself on keeping its nose clean, but this lawyer passed on information that resulted in trading profits of nearly $1 million.
Now you'd think that someone who'd reached such professional heights had it made (if by "it" you mean money), but the siren song was clearly too loud.
MUNICIPAL FINANCE A County Circles Its Oranges A lot of people are against taxes, but Orange County voters surely take the prize.
Last week they refused to approve a mere half-percent emergency sales tax increase, even though this defiant stand nudged them toward a rather messy abyss.
The county's in bankruptcy, its debt is now in default, a state takeover looms, and it's far from clear how the trash will be collected and the students taught.
Couldn't the county issue more bonds to make it all better?
Right.
A fellow here has a nice bridge to sell to those bond buyers.
And perhaps worse, municipal bonds all over the place have gotten a black eye.
HEALTH CARE The H.M.O.
Giant Is Coming H.M.O.'s are coming.
Yes, yes, they've been here for some time, but now they'll really be a force to reckon with.
Last week United Healthcare, an H.M.O. giant based in Minnesota, agreed to buy Metrahealth, a more traditional insurer.
Metrahealth, carved recently out of the Met Life and Travelers health businesses, has 10 million customers, including 1.5 million in the New York area.
The merger with United Healthcare will create the nation's largest health-plan company.
So if H.M.O.'s have always seemed a distant concept -- somewhere else, affecting someone else -- that is sure to change in a hurry.
TOBACCO Keeping Minors From Smoking Let's see.
Philip Morris wants to sell cigarettes -- that's its business.
And most smokers start when they are teen-agers.
Yet last week the company said it would go all out to keep minors from smoking. (Well, not exactly all out: the plan will cost $5 million; 1994 profits were $4.7 billion.) Highlights of the program are a national ad campaign, warnings that say "Underage Sale Prohibited," and the end of promotional giveaways.


Saratoga
At Saratoga Race Course, one can still walk the length of the grandstand and view the strata of society, laid out like so many neat geological layers.
At one end stand the railbirds in their T-shirts, craning on tiptoe, The Racing Form stuffed into their back pockets.
Proceeding along the grandstand, cutoff jeans are replaced by Bermuda shorts and baseball caps give way to Ray-Bans.
Near the finish line, owners and breeders sip cocktails in their clubhouse boxes, a sea of double-breasted blazers and linen dresses.
Saratoga Springs, a 30-minute drive north of Albany, is still very much the summer playground for the elite that it has been for more than a century.
It is Mary Lou Whitney, Saratoga's most prominent socialite, making a grand entrance at her annual ball in a horse-drawn carriage.
It is the Fasig-Tipton auction, where some of the best yearlings in America sell for up to a half-million dollars.
It is the most elegant Old World horse track in the country, where, as Heywood Hale Broun once wrote, a day at the races is like being "transported by a time machine into a sporting print."


Bridging the Income Gap After Law School
SINSI HERNANDEZ-CANCIO might have expected that after three years of law school and $87,000 in debts she could at least stop borrowing money and start making it.
Surprise!
It is not that Ms.
Hernandez-Cancio, a graduate of the New York University Law School, has no job.
She landed a $28,000-a-year position as a staff lawyer for Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit group.
But after graduating, she faced three months of full-time study for the New York bar exam -- and an empty wallet.


Peel Me a Grape
NEW JERSEY wines?
To those who have never heard of them, much less tasted them, the three words sound like an oxymoron, the setup line of yet another weary Jersey joke.


Elizabeth L. Kerr And Sandy Fish
Elizabeth Lynne Kerr, a daughter of Drs.
Sandria and William Kerr of Winston-Salem, N.C., is to be married today to Stanton David Fish, a son of Ilene and Dr.
Irving Fish of Tenafly, N.J.
Rabbi Jack Bemporad is to perform the ceremony at the Benson University Center at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem.
The bride, 25, is a graduate of Washington University in St.
Louis, as is the bridegroom.
She is a candidate for a master's degree in decorative arts at Bard Graduate Center in New York.
Her father is a professor of physics at Wake Forest.
Her mother is a professor of computer science at Winston-Salem State University.


A New Order Reigns On the Highest Court
With its term that ended last week, the Supreme Court embarked on a bold new era of conservative activism.
An ascendant bloc of three conservative Justices spurred the Court to challenge long-held assumptions about Federal power.
The Court itself has turned topsy turvy.
Activism, once derided by conservatives, is now their domain.
Liberals urge judicial restraint.
The center has evaporated.


[ APPEARANCES ] ; MADE IN THE SHADE
My friend Sigrid Burton, a painter who lives in SoHo, had a melanoma removed last summer.
A melanoma, of course, can be lethal, but when, as in Sigrid's case, it's caught early (before it spreads), the rate of cure is 93 percent.
Since melanoma is related to sun exposure, Sigrid decided to avoid suntanning as much as possible.
She vowed to cultivate an "interestingly pale" look, which was fine for winter.
But now that summer's come, and she is commuting to the Hamptons on weekends, she's been talking about her "pasty" face and "doughy" thighs.
I was worried that going pale was affecting Sigrid's self-esteem.
Her inner child happens to be a California girl who used to slather herself with baby oil and iodine to achieve the proper bronzed goddess effect.
When I suggested using a sunless tanning lotion, she was dubious.
"You mean that stuff I used when I was 13 and I came out in orange streaks?" I said I thought they'd improved it recently.
I'd heard good things along the beauty grapevine.


Long Island Q&amp;A: Jerry Shore; A Pacesetter in the Highly Competitive Computer Industry
MAKE it smaller, faster and better," Jerry Shore said. That is an appropriate mantra for the head of a company whose inventions are basic to dozens of industries.
With that philosophy, Mr.
Shore said, he transformed the business he began with $26,000 into a leading designer and manufacturer of computer-circuit boards, plumbing hardware, nameplates, adhesives and the like.


When the Night Hummed
GROWING up in the 1960's in the Monroe Park section of Atlantic City, Karlos LaSane 2d was convinced he was going to be the among the greatest musicians of his era.
His father, Karlos LaSane, was maitre d'hotel of Club Harlem, and father and son lived for the evenings -- the elder Mr.
LaSane donning a tuxedo, the younger leaving his summer job picking trash off the Boardwalk to stand in his father's shadow, where he met musicians and entertainers, sat in on the shows, learned how to play trumpet, drums and bass guitar, and eventually sat in with a few Club Harlem bands.


CONNECTICUT GUIDE
'INVENTION ADVENTURE' Legos, the Danish toy blocks and bricks, are the basis for a summer of constructive fun for children from 4 to 16 at the Science Center of Connecticut, 950 Trout Brook Drive, in West Hartford.
Developed with the help of the American Institute of Architects, Prof.
Seymour Papert of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Association of Science-Technology Centers, the program "Invention Adventure" challenges young people to use creative abilities they may never have been called upon to summon up before.


Greasepaint at Greenpoint: The Roar of the Homeless Crowd
Mixing the light-hearted with the heart-breaking, a group of men from the Greenpoint Men's Shelter put on a show last week that lampooned life's absurdities and took a stark look at the problems that plague their lives -- AIDS, tuberculosis, drug addiction, violence and homelessness.
With tragicomic skits, heartfelt poems, sweet singing and powerful rapping, the troupe of about 15 shelter residents staged "Life Styles: Decisions, Choices, Consequences," a variety show with a moral.
Between pantomimes of temptation -- of drinking 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor, injecting heroin and smoking crack -- and monologues about sobering up in "Camp One-Day-at-a-Time," there were vignettes of lives not ordinarily portrayed on the stage.


County Debating Hospital's Status
THROUGHOUT the country, public hospitals are falter ing unable to keep pace with the changes around them.
In Los Angeles, a proposal is under consideration to close the Los Angeles County-University of California Medical Center -- one of the largest hospitals in the nation -- because it is facing a budget deficit of more than $1 billion.
In Nassau County, a committee appointed to question whether government should be in the business of health care is studying privatization of the financially strapped County Medical Center there.
And in Washington, budget cuts have forced the District of Columbia to consider changing the form of governance at its public hospital.


Eagles Are Back, Minus Grime
The eagles have landed.
After a year-and-a-half cleansing, four 1,200-pound bronze statues returned Wednesday to their roosts atop doric columns at the Grand Army Plaza entrance to Prospect Park.
Weather, smog and the droppings of real feather-and-blood birds had marred the sculpted eagles, which were installed in 1901.
So they were taken to the Modern Art Foundry in Queens for a high-tech bird bath -- workers blasted the eagles with tiny glass beads or crushed walnut shells to remove corrosion.


The World; Why the U.S. Takes Guff From Weaklings
BURIED in the praise that the American diplomat Mickey Kantor heaped upon his trade agreement with the Japanese was a kernel of realism.
"We did the best we could on this," Mr.
Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, said the other day.
"Given the state of the Japanese economy, we had to be realistic."
What he also could have said is that, in order to avert a trade war, the United States had to accept less than it wanted in its trade agreement with Japan because the Government in Tokyo was too weak to make many concessions -- and very eager to claim victory over the United States.

The Urban Swimming Hole
I NEVER imagined a backyard swimming pool in my industrial neighborhood -- where there isn't a lot of space -- until one day I heard mysterious splashing.
I peeked through some fencing to see an enormous above-ground pool virtually filling an entire backyard, leaving room only for a few tables and chairs.
Randel Turner of Jamaica, Queens, told me that Count Basie had had a big pool in his backyard in St.
Albans.
On hot summer nights you could hear the sound of his band mixed with the laughter of ebullient swimmers.
And if you drove by you'd see a whole line of children peering through the fence.

LAST LOOK


POSTINGS: Auction in the Poconos; For Sale: An Airport
A 440-acre combination airport, picnic grove, lake and Christmas tree farm in Sterling, Pa., subdivided into 17 parcels, is to be sold at auction next Saturday.
Mike Caputo, a tree farmer and private pilot, bought the property in 1969 when it was just another 1,750-foot mountaintop in the Poconos with 60-mile views.
Mr.
Caputo turned it into a landscaped multipurpose air park complete with a beach, tennis courts and a children's playground.

SUNDAY, July 2, 1995; STUFF: Money and Chrome -- the American Way
In the 1969 movie "Easy Rider," Peter Fonda rode a chopped Harley-Davidson Panhead, painted in stars and stripes, in search of America.
Today, magnates and movie stars ride Harleys and true devotees spend thousands to customize machines once known as hogs.
The six Harleys d'art above show some of the passion and lunacy of motorcycle romance.
Top left: An orange 1980 Shovelhead, a classic super-sanitary (meaning spare, Bauhaus style) chopper with precise chroming, $15,000.
Right: A candy-red, full-fendered Softail (the term refers to the suspension), which aficionados would call "swoopy" -- long, low . . . and $40,000.
Middle left: An over-the-top Southwest-style paint job on a $40,000 Softail.
Right: A yellow-and-violet, $50,000 superbike (Softail) with exotic billet parts, each machined from a solid block of aluminum.
Bottom left: a blue $35,000 Fat Boy that James Dean, whose face is on the gas tank, would surely have found too rococo.
Right: A tough, massive $38,000 silver-and-white Softail, notable for its stretched gas tanks.


IN SHORT: FICTION
REDEMPTION  By Leon Uris. HarperCollins, $25.


'Hamlet' as Autobiography, Spoken in Reflective Voice
Robert Wilson, the renowned American theater artist who spends much of his time overseas, has joined an exclusive society.
He is a member of what might be called the Hamlet Club, made up of performers who have taken on the most famous of all Shakespearean roles.
But because the avant-garde Mr.
Wilson is who he is -- creator, performer, director, designer -- he will open the Serious Fun Festival at Lincoln Center on Thursday in a solo show: "Hamlet: A Monologue."
The play, with original music and sound score by the frequent Wilson collaborator Hans Peter Kuhn, has been directed and designed by Mr.
Wilson.
It is a production of the Alley Theater in Houston, where the world premiere was held in May.
Mr.
Wilson, who is 54 and was born in Waco, Tex., is an associate artist at the Alley.
Performances at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center are through Saturday.


Pitching Shortage Big Worry For Yanks
The calendar inside Buck Showalter's ubiquitous black notebook would usually have these names listed on successive days: Key, McDowell, Perez, Kamieniecki and Hitchcock.
In a world without injuries, the manager would have a dependable rotation, but the world is not always healthy and so Showalter's calendar has become a sloppy and tedious exercise.
Three of his five starters are injured and unavailable.
Already, Jimmy Key was unlikely to pitch this season because of chronic pain in his left shoulder and Scott Kamieniecki was recuperating from a sprained right elbow, then on Friday, Melido Perez left a 12-6 shellacking against the Brewers with stiffness and soreness in his right shoulder.
He will miss at least one start.


Tunes in the Summer Air
A concert and an opera, and a fantasy ball fit for Cinderella.


Still Rural, Amagansett Is Changing, But Warily
SETTLED in 1680, Amagansett is a sleepy hamlet of 902 inhabitants between East Hampton and Montauk.
For some travelers it is only a blur through a car window, a nanosecond on Route 27 with a Main Street two blocks long.
But for some residents, plans could turn "the Place of Good Water," the original meaning in the Montauk language, into a "town of bad feelings."


Lisa Simmons, Joshua Weinstein
Lisa Simmons, a magazine editor, and Joshua Weinstein, a television producer, are to be married today in Waban, Mass., at the home of the bride's parents, Maureen and Dr.
James B. Simmons.
Rabbi Frank Waldorf is to perform the ceremony.
The bride, 31, is the West Coast editor of Cosmopolitan magazine in Los Angeles.
She graduated cum laude from Barnard College.
Her father is the chief of radiology at Marlborough Hospital in Marlborough, Mass.


Americans in a Land of Opportunity: Europe
FOR GENERATIONS, AMERICAN ARTISTS heeded the call of Paris.
First came the painters, Mary Cassatt and Winslow Homer among them, lured by the Impressionist movement of the late 19th century.
Then it was the turn of writers, with Edith Wharton leading the way in the 1910's and Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound and Scott Fitzgerald soon following.
By the 1930's, Josephine Baker was the toast of le tout Paris, and black American performers had found a home here.
After World War II, Paris was where Henry Miller could get published, where James Baldwin felt free to live and write.
Then, it seems, Paris stopped being an important port of call for American creators.


Portraits of a Memento Mori That Used to Meow
One balmy evening, Andrew Garn, 38, a photographer whose work is regularly seen in the O. K. Harris gallery in SoHo, opened his freezer and pulled out a black garbage bag wedged between two sticks of Hotel Bar butter and a couple of Stouffer's frozen dinners.
Inside the bag was a slightly dingy pink towel, which he gently unwrapped to reveal a frozen cat.
"Hi, Clay," he sang cheerfully, fluffing up her gray fur, which was still soft.


Trouble Down on the Farm
Where have all the baseball fans gone?
Apparently fed up because of the strike and the economic and legal machinations in the major leagues, many are abandoning big league ballparks this season, driving down attendance more than 20 percent and taking their discretionary income elsewhere.
Disenchantment, however, hasn't spread to the minors.
"Baseball the way it used to be" is how fans and pundits commonly characterize minor league baseball.
Cheap seats, closeness to the playing field, the hustle of young athletes -- the traditional virtues of minor league baseball are still evident.
While fans stay away from the big leagues, attendance in the minors is holding steady, the latest sign of strength in a 15-year resurgence in popularity.


Knicks Offer the Job to Nelson
Madison Square Garden President Dave Checketts said the Knicks have offered Don Nelson the job as coach of the team and that negotiations between the two parties could come to a close early this week.
"Offers have been made, and we're in the midst of going over a few things that still need to be worked out," Checketts said last night.
"Things are going well, but I'm not going to announce anything until everything is signed and sealed."


Playing for the Love of Baseball
IT has been a long time between innings.
The Peekskill Highlanders zipped up their bat bags in 1949.
But professional baseball returned to Westchester County this weekend.
After more than two weeks on the road, the Yonkers Hoot Owls of the new Northeast Baseball League were to open their home season last night against the Sullivan County Mountain Lions.
They are scheduled to play the Mountain Lions again tonight at Fleming Field in Yonkers.


Benign Bugs: Hello Phobics
A 25-FOOT-LONG ant?
An 18-foot praying mantis?
A dragonfly with a 17-foot wingspan?
Sounds like a B-grade horror movie?
These bugs are neither B-grade, nor horrifying.
They're handmade from trees, dried branches, vines, bark and similar materials, and will be on display all summer at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.


Funds With a Continental Flair
A SIZZLING year in 1993 put European stock funds on the map.
The number of funds in the group nearly doubled, to 43, soon afterward.
If this year's returns continue apace, as the pundits are suggesting, look for the group's ranks to swell again next year.


90's Cuisine in a 19th-Century Setting
TAVERN ON MAIN looks as if it has been around since Revolutionary War days, but in fact it's a new addition to Westport -- and a welcome one.
The building is indeed vintage 1810, and has evolved from farmhouse to girls' school to the town's original ice cream parlor.
The last occupant was Chez Pierre, long a local landmark, more for its cozy atmosphere than its food.


Rain Claims a Casualty As Briton Takes Tumble
The start of the Tour de France was skewed tonight by a heavy and steady rainstorm that began after the first few dozen of 189 riders set out, one by one, in the short prologue of the three-week bicycle race.
The only rider who appeared to take a chance and go all out in the rain, Chris Boardman of England, the winner of the prologue in the last Tour, skidded on the slippery pavement, crashed into a rail and seemed to be badly injured.
Helped into his team car when he tried and failed to continue on another bicycle, he had to quit after perhaps four minutes of competition.


June 25 - July 1: Aspirations; Whitman's Budget Ax Clears a Path for Her
Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, likes to say that, by getting elected a year ahead of the Republicans who won last November, Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey gave herself a chance to be the pathfinder in her party's trek toward lower taxes and leaner government with more local control in statehouses.
Last week, Mrs.
Whitman showed she knew the way when she rolled over the objections of some of her own party's leaders to enact the second half of her 30 percent income tax cut a year ahead of schedule.
The legislature, which is in Republican hands, also passed her $16 billion budget for the coming year, including a plan to put dozens of state operations in the hands of private contractors, at the cost of 2,900 public jobs.
The Governor's easy budget victory did nothing to diminish her reputation as a contender for the national ticket next year.
Even complaints from statehouse Democrats that she is starving the state of services to fatten her own national reputation have failed to dampen New Jerseyans' affection for her.
But Mrs.
Whitman must wonder if her national destiny will find her before the weaknesses in her budget do.
Her tax cut needs a strong economy and the indicators are faltering.
And even Republicans fear that her cuts may only raise property taxes.
But by then she could be in Washington.
IVER PETERSON


The Nation: Presidential Poses; Campaign Trail or Garden Path?
WHAT ever happened to the Rose Garden strategy?
Time was when a President facing a re-election campaign would use the majesty and aura of his office to rise above all challengers, when he would spend his time signing bills and making pronouncements in the lush green expanse of the White House Rose Garden.
The subliminal message: I'm too busy presiding to stoop to mere campaigning.


WESTCHESTER GUIDE
STEPPING INTO HISTORY The business district of Nyack, where several 19th-century Victorian buildings still stand, will be explored in an architectural walking tour today at 2 P.M.
The $5 fee includes a map offering several self-guided Nyack walking tours.
The meeting place is the Nyack Community Center, on South Broadway; no reservations are necessary.
Robert Goldberg, chairman of the Discover the Nyacks Committee of the Friends of the Nyacks will lead the walk.
"Things look very much as they did when Nyack was at its height as a river port in the 1870's and 80's," he said.
"That's when most of the downtown buildings were built." The ground floors have been altered but, "if you look up, the second stories are almost all intact," Mr.
Goldberg continued.


Sky Beauty, a Favorite At Belmont, Is Retired
Sky Beauty, the queen of New York mares, is being retired at the age of 5 after winning 15 of her 21 races, an Eclipse Award and $1.3 million in prize money.
Allen Jerkens, who trained the filly, confirmed yesterday that she was being sent to the Wycombe Farm in Reddick, Fla., by her owner, Georgia E. Hofmann, who has delayed the announcement because she has been traveling in Europe.
He added, "I hate to lose her because she has been so good to us for so long."


When New York Was the New Place to Play
IT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES, IT WAS THE worst of times.
Some concerts were so popular that tickets were scalped for $650.
Legendary virtuosos made their way to New York, which was also the testing ground for aspiring performers.
Grand concert halls were constructed, though some were harshly criticized for putting decoration above good acoustics.
Critics lobbied for American composers and condemned the New York Philharmonic for its excessive love of European models.
Some writers were astounded by the plentiful "trash" attracting inordinate public attention.
It was, in other words, a time very like the present.
But this was New York in the 1850's, when the city was not yet a world-class metropolis and American musical culture was in its infancy.
So everything was radically different, as if taking place in a parallel universe in which the language was the same but the meaning unfamiliar.

Changing Face of Health Care (Cont'd): Private Doctors, Public Patients
Alisia Charles was bundling up her 5-week-old son Jemuel last week after a visit to the pediatrician.
She was in a good mood.
In less than an hour, she and Jemuel had been seen by nurses and a doctor at the Chelsea Practice health center here on Ventnor Avenue and was on her way.
"It's a lot quicker now," Ms.
Charles said, recalling the days when the center was run by the Atlantic City Health Department.
"They are more organized."


'Blatantly Racist'
To the Editor:
Poor old offensive Uncle Remus.
According to the short piece with the main article on "Pocahontas"  [ "It's a Small World . . . and Not Always P.C." ] , this man's politically incorrect crimes (as depicted in the 1946 Disney movie "Song of the South") included being happy-go-lucky, telling stories about animals and cheering white folks up with a song.
I thank God we live in an age when enlightened self-reproach can deliver us and our children from this repellent Negro caricature.

Other Methods, Other Madness And Always Slings and Arrows
John Barrymore claimed to have played Hamlet on a London stage while dead drunk.
And to have received rave reviews for it.
Sir Laurence Olivier played the role so well in his 1948 film version that he became the only performer in Academy Award history so far to direct himself in an Oscar-winning performance.
Actors in every generation have used the role of the melancholy, semisuicidal, possibly insane, possibly incestuous young Danish prince to establish their greatness or at least their credibility as serious actors.
And lately, it seems, a number of actors with movie careers have joined the throng.
Here are some of those who have stepped into the role in recent years, with varying results, as the critics have observed.
ANITA GATES


ANGRY FATHERS
Some 35 years ago, at the age of 15, I wrote my first letter to the editor -- to Mell Lazarus, at The Herald Tribune, telling him that his comic strip "Miss Peach" made me laugh.
Now, so many years later, I write to let him know that his About Men column "Angry Fathers" (May 28) made me cry.
I thank him again.

The Pool House: Making A Stylish Splash
THE English have long had a passion for temples, for ruins, for garden follies; starting in the early 18th century, they began dotting them around the landscape like daffodils in the spring.
Americans, being more practical, generally eschewed such fantastical and useless architectural objects.
Outbuildings were tool sheds, four-square and double-doored; garages were wooden boxes where the family automobile was stored.


Family Picnic
Patrick Clark, who recently became executive chef of the celebrated Tavern on the Green in Manhattan, is a chef's son who grew up in the Carnarsie section of Brooklyn.
Clark's father, Melvin, was an early practitioner of New American cuisine -- down-home food, local ingredients.
He was adept at polishing dishes that had been long taken for granted and using ingredients that had been nearly forgotten.
Clark suspects he was fated by blood to learn restaurateuring, like his father, at the New York City Technical College.
Clark also says that he was graced by changing times when he had a chance to hone his cooking skills with some European maestros, unlike his father, who worked at various New York restaurants, including the Four Seasons and Charley O's (as executive chef).
Big family gatherings -- the Fourth of July, for example -- are always a reckoning for the 40-year-old Clark, himself the father of five.


For Nine Days, Connecticut Is Host to a World of Athletes and Abilities
The first soccer ball was booted at 8:15 A.M. today and one hour later the first runner finished the first race, the first of many to come at the Special Olympics World Games.
She was Aspasia N. Kalla of Athens, and the event was a preliminary heat of the 3,000 meters.
Although Kalla looked back often, there was no need because she led the field of 15 from the start and had a comfortable margin in all seven and a half laps around the Yale track.
Her time was a commendable 11 minutes 36 seconds.


Jennifer Foust, Jefferson Tuttle
Jennifer Lynn Foust, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Mrs.
Tuttle, 22, graduated in May from Purdue University.
Her father is the manager of new business development for the consumer imaging division of the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester.


Smothering in Junk, State Plans to Clean Its Attic
Anyone who doubts New Jersey's commitment to conservation has never been inside the nondescript yellow building at 300 Whitehead Road.
There, behind a metal door, lie several decades worth of the accumulated debris of bureaucracy: endless shelves stacked with Jetsons-era computer keyboards, water-damaged chairs, reams of copying paper, a contraption that looks like a hand-cranked film projector with a built-in water bottle but is actually a vintage gummed packing-tape wetter.
For the privilege of holding onto these possessions, taxpayers are paying the building's owner $18,000 a year.

Group Wants To Broaden Securities Bill
THE comprehensive securities bill that passed the Senate last week is too narrow, the Investment Company Institute, the Washington trade group for mutual funds, has argued.
In addition to the sale of stocks and bonds, the measure should apply to the sale of mutual funds, Matthew P. Fink, the group's president, wrote in a letter to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, chairman of the Banking Committee.

TAKING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION APART
I am an advocate of at least some degree of affirmative action, especially when it encourages men with the energy of Dr.
Patrick Chavis.
To bill Medicaid $800,000 a year at $14 an office visit and $400 a delivery, he would have to see 10 patients an hour, 10 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, and then deliver two babies on each of those days.

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
THE X FACTOR  A Quest for Excellence. By George Plimpton. Norton, $18.95.


EYES ON THE PRIZE
Nicholas Wade's "Eyes on the Prize" (Method &amp; Madness, April 30) makes some good points that we at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will take into account in developing the Lemelson-M.I.T.
Prize for invention and innovation in its second year.
But he was wrong to belittle our first winner's achievements.
William Bolander's nine patents cover a range of innovations in automotive technology that has improved the cost, efficiency and safety of American cars.


Up on the Roof With Some Heat-Loving Plants
This roof garden of mine is the urban story of Job.
A 90-pound bag of potting soil, for instance, is about as easy to carry as a bale of hay, so I ask some sinewy gardener at the nursery to heft it into my old Trooper.
When I get home, I slash open the bag and carry the soil in two of the white plastic buckets I'm in the habit of collecting from construction sites around town.
I make several trips up five flights of stairs, after which I don't need the Stairmaster or that arm-pull whatzit at the gym.
I've considered buying smaller bags, but that would be like buying one tea bag when you're serving a convention of English gardeners.
Roof gardens require containers as deep and wide as your roof can support without collapsing, because it gets hotter than Hades up there when the sun shines all day.


Word for Word / The Skinhead International; Some Music, It Turns Out, Inflames the Savage Breast
THE notion of a global network of xenophobes seems implausible, but that is what a recent report about neo-Nazi skinheads describes.
"The Skinhead International," issued last week by the Anti-Defamation League, describes murders, beatings, fire-bombings, race-baiting and other activities by small groups of shaven-headed nationalist thugs in 31 countries, most in Europe and the Americas.


World News Briefs; 3 Linked to Attack On Mubarak Are Killed
Three of the gunmen involved in an attempt to assassinate President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Monday were killed today in a shootout with security forces, Ethiopia said.
The announcement that more gunmen from the group, estimated at nine, that attacked Mr.
Mubarak's convoy in Addis Ababa had been killed appears to have fanned suspicions here that Ethiopia is helping to wipe out evidence of the assassination plot.
Egypt has accused the Sudan of being behind it.

What Ford Discovered When He Paid His Workers $5 a Day
To the Editor:
"Bad News for Workers" (editorial, June 24) will also prove to be bad news for capital owners.


For a Touch of Color and Flavor in Risotto or Salad, Add Beets
BEETS are one of my favorite root vegetables, especially in the summertime.
They add a dash of color as well as flavor to salads and are especially good with game, duck, beef and other dark meats and things cooked on the grill. (They contain a crimson dye called betanin, which stains other ingredients, so I usually toss them in the dressing separately.)


CHATTER: Public and Private; What Customer Service?
Public or private, services need to change.
As someone who once bragged about the swift and thorough manner New Jersey delivered to its consumers, I was appalled at the way my parents were treated the last time we visited the D.M.V.
What happened to the customer service training?


So Far, Nomo Tops the List of Season's Remarkable Rookies
The word rookie has two O's; so does the name Nomo.
That's just about where the resemblance ends between Hideo Nomo and a rookie.
Nomo, of course, is a major league rookie, but he hasn't pitched like one.
He has more closely resembled a Hall of Famer, Sandy Koufax.

Eating a Sub on One
Las Vegas is filled with hotels pretending to be everything from an Egyptian pyramid to a medieval castle.
Now there's a restaurant masquerading as a submarine.
The interior of Dive, a sandwich shop that opened last month on the Strip across from the Treasure Island hotel and casino, simulates the inside of a submarine, with the clanging of bells and other sounds of a diving maneuver.
It is the second in what the entertainment executives Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg plan as a chain (or fleet?).

Michael Graves, Kymberly Truman
Kymberly Ann Truman, the daughter of Lois Tillman of Philadelphia and Peter Truman of Millville, N.J., was married yesterday to Michael Alan Graves, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Earl G. Graves of Scarsdale, N.Y.
The Rev.
Canon Thomas S. Logan Sr. performed the ceremony at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Philadelphia.
Mrs.
Graves, 29, graduated from the University of Maryland at College Park and received a law degree in May from the District of Columbia School of Law.
Her father retired as the chief administrator of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas.
Her mother is an investigator in Philadelphia for the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.


Crime
In his ambitious mystery debut, ZIA SUMMER (Warner, $21.95), Rudolfo Anaya, the author of "Bless Me, Ultima," whom Tony Hillerman calls the "godfather and guru of Chicano literature," makes Albuquerque, N.M., sound like the birthplace of life and the cradle of civilization.
Other regional writers may feel the same about their own blessed plots, but few manage to express that feeling with Mr.
Anaya's passion and lyricism.
"His parents had given him a history, a sense of the traditions of the valley . . . but somewhere along the way, he began to get separated," we learn of Sonny Baca, a private detective whose investigation into the grisly ritual slaying of his cousin leads him back to the cultural heritage of the antepasados, his ancestors.
Sonny's hunt for the murderer sends him up and down the Rio Grande Valley, into the ideologically armed camps of environmentalists, New Age cultists and real estate developers, who all invoke the Zia sign -- "the powerful, positive image of the sun, symbol of the state flag, god of life" -- for their designs on the land.
But the real journey is the spiritual one that takes Sonny through his racial and regional history and into the soul of his people.


A Needed Ingredient For Stratford Theater
Re the Shakespeare Theater: ("Will Stratford Ever Be Home to Shakespeare Again?," June 11).
All the miscarried efforts at revival over the past years have lacked one essential ingredient.
That ingredient is a competent theater person at the head -- either a top artistic director or a top theater administrator -- seconded in either case by a very good representative of the other.
Such names as Lawrence Langner, John Houseman and Michael Kahn come to mind from the original Shakespeare Theater.

The Future Of the Aquacade
To the Editor:
We must not let the Aquacade fall victim to the wrecker's ball  [ Real Estate, May 28; news article, June 6 ] .
It is a great public space that provides a direct memory of a time in the not-too-distant past when New Yorkers delighted in a proud and generous civicism.
It far exceeds, in both scale and ambition, the vast majority of public spaces built today.
We simply don't build buildings like it now.


Summer in the Park With the Bard
THE NEW YORK SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL is marking its 40th season this summer with productions of "The Tempest" and "Troilus and Cressida" at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park.

In Northern New Mexico, Some Seek The End of the Rainbow Gathering
Long before the county control movement or the Sagebrush Rebellion, the people here in Rio Arriba County in northern New Mexico considered the Federal Government an occupying power that stole their birthright -- old Spanish and Mexican land grants absorbed by the United States Forest Service.
The Nortenos, or people of the north, as they call themselves, have also long been suspicious of outsiders, particularly long-haired Anglos like the people who arrived en masse in the late 60's and early 70's, setting off a series of skirmishes known locally as the Chicano-hippie wars.


China Has World's Best Reason to Limit Births; Forced Abortions
To the Editor:

Mandatory sterilization and insertion of intrauterine devices were mentioned, but not abortion, which is also a part of the program.

Talks May Worry Lebanese in Israeli Zone
As Israel and Syria finished an inconclusive new round of peace talks in Washington this week, Israeli Army commanders in southern Lebanon cautioned that the negotiations create "uncertainty" for the roughly 200,000 Lebanese living in this region that is under Israel's control.
Brig.
Gen.
Giora Inbar, commander of Israeli forces in the strip of southern Lebanon proclaimed by Israel as its "security zone," said this week that public morale was low in the area, with many people worried about what a possible Syrian-Israeli peace treaty would mean for them.


Loss of Supermarket Puts a Heavy Burden on Elderly Hartsdale Residents
FOR Nathan Goldstein, a retired senior citizen who has lived for the last 12 years in one of the high-rise apartments that dot East Hartsdale Avenue, his lack of a driver's license has rarely been a problem.
With a variety of stores within easy walking distance of his home, he and his wife have been able to run the errands that most other suburbanites undertake from behind the wheel.
But when Gristede's moved at the end of last year, leaving a vacant supermarket, Mr.
Goldstein and many of his Hartsdale neighbors felt the loss.


Looking Back to 1855 For July 4 Celebration
THE musical "1776" recalled the way Americans marked their first Fourth of July, but 1855 is the year chosen for celebratory re-creations at Sunnyside, the Washington Irving homestead in Tarrytown.
Burns Patterson, spokesman for Historic Hudson Valley, which operates Sunnyside, said that Tuesday should be a great day for the whole family: "A brass band will perform, there' will be an entertaining juggler, and actors will bring the crucial issues of 1855 to life with rousing speeches."
In 1855, incidentally, Irving coined the phrase the "almighty dollar," the Know-Nothing Party claimed 1.5 million voters, and a musical version (not animated) of "Pocohontas" by John Brougham opened in New York.
It was subtitled "Ye Gentle Savage."


City Ballet, at the Boiling Point
WONDERS NEVER CEASE.
For years, Jerome Robbins staged "N. Y. Export: Opus Jazz," his 1958 ballet about gang warfare, for a variety of companies but never for the New York City Ballet -- ostensibly because he considered the troupe too classical for the work's vernacular style.
But suddenly this spring, the City Ballet had a smash hit on its hands: a suite of dances about, yes, gang warfare, derived from Mr.
Robbins's 1957 Broadway musical "West Side Story." The production is called simply "West Side Story Suite." The operative word is suite, and it not only defines what the work is and is not but also says something about the City Ballet's particular approach to music.


Froth and Fun Emerge on Summer Stages
IN the summertime, the mind must rest.
That's the perception of warm-weather theater, which traditionally goes by names like Summerfun, Summerfest or some such tag that perpetuates the old saw of summer stock as frothy and unthreatening, or, the way theater managers put it, light and lively.
Rather than buck the convention, New Jersey summer theaters are going with the rules or just not playing.
Stageworks/Summit is not playing.
An audacious company that didn't flinch from summer fare as an intellectual dare, whether the subject was Melville's whale or Hauptmann's trial, is switching seasons.


No-Smoking Law Takes Full Effect in Vermont
Smoking is prohibited starting this month in restaurants, bars and the common areas of hotels and motels in Vermont.
These establishments had been given a two-year grace period under the state's Clean Indoor Air Act, which went into effect in July of 1993 and outlawed smoking in most places of business.
There are 3,500 to 4,000 restaurants in Vermont, according to the state's Department of Health.
Only establishments licensed as cabarets by the state's Department of Liquor Control are exempt from the smoking ban.
As a result, the number of cabaret licenses in Vermont has more than doubled in recent months.
For the last license year, May 1994 through April 1995, the department issued about 80 full-year cabaret licenses.
In the last two months, more than 200 restaurants have been issued the licenses.
Cabarets must receive less than half of their receipts from the sale of food.


Crime Coverage Mellows, and Answers Are Not at All Simple
The New York City news media, usually packed with chilling accounts of urban mayhem, have been presenting a mellower portrait of crime in the city lately.
Although there are always especially horrifying crimes that force their way into the headlines, like the murder spree of Darnell Collins last month, a review of recent crime coverage indicates there has been sharply less of it -- less than half the number of articles in the city's newspapers than in a comparable period last year.


Ernest V. Heyn; Author and Editor, 90

He was author of "A Century of Wonders: One Hundred Years of Popular Science" (Doubleday, 1972), a history of the magazine.


Sheree Rumley and Delmar Gillus
SHEREE NICOLE RUMLEY, 26, grew up on the Upper West Side reading African-American authors like Langston Hughes and Toni Morrison; taking flute lessons at the Harlem School for the Arts; singing in the choir at the Convent Avenue Baptist Church; excelling in math at Horace Mann High School, and attending meetings of Jack and Jill of America, a social organization for young African-Americans.
As a teen-ager, she kept a checklist of qualities she wanted in a future husband.
Among other things, he had to be handsome, outgoing, good at math and knowledgeable about black history and culture.

Milbury Likes Islanders
It appears that former Boston Bruins Coach Mike Milbury has emerged as the front-runner for the vacant Islanders head coaching position.
"I've had a couple of real good discussions with Don Maloney," Milbury said by phone last night from his Boston-area home, referring to the Islanders general manager.
"I think it could be a good fit. We're working on something and I feel good about saying things look like they are progressing. I hope to have some indication one way or another by mid-week."


Yugoslavia Tops Greece To Make European Final Vs. Surprising Lithuania
Political symbolism was the loser tonight in the semifinals of the European basketball championships.
It was beaten by a big-hearted guard named Sarunas Marciulionis, a big-bodied center named Arvidas Sabonis and a relatively anonymous supporting cast that hardly played like extras.
Yugoslavia will indeed be in Sunday's final.
It beat Greece and its strong-lunged fans, 60-52.
The surprise is that the Yugoslavs will not meet their former teammates, the Croats.
Instead, Vlade Divac and his fellow Serbs and Montenegrins will face Lithuania, a team with its own rich and turbulent history.


Uncertainty Pains Oklahoma City Merchants
"Yes, We Are Open," read the plaintive signs at the Phoenix Book Store nailed to sheets of plywood where windows used to be, three blocks from where the bomb destroyed the Federal Building here on April 19.
"The roof got lifted off and set back down, so every time it rains, the ceiling leaks," said Andy Waner, an assistant manager of the store, which sports a huge collection of old dime-store westerns.
"Then we have to cover up all the bookcases with tarps, and we get out the Shop-Vac."

Now, with near unanimity, investment advisers are forecasting warm and sunny weather ahead for European stocks.

U.N. Charter Signing
To the Editor:
Contrary to your June 27 news article on the ceremony marking the adoption of the United Nations Charter 50 years ago, the document was not signed on the stage of the San Francisco Opera House, where the commemorative celebration took place, but on the stage of the Herbst Theater in the Veterans War Memorial Building next door.


Denying History Disables Japan
IN BEIJING, IN JUNE 1960, I WAS SITTING ACROSS FROM MAO Zedong.
In the courtyard through which we had walked to his office, magnolias were white in the midnight darkness, emitting a heavy scent, and that is what has remained most deeply in my memory.
How skillfully Garcia Marquez might recreate the scene!
Mao Zedong said only things that even I, at 25 and not his most enthusiastic reader, could tell consisted of quotations from his own writings.
By his side sat Zhou Enlai, turned not toward us but toward Mao, who spoke as if he were remembering things of the past for his old comrade.
Each time Mao, who smoked incessantly, reached for a can of Giant Panda brand cigarettes, Zhou would gently push it slightly away.


On the Senate Floor, One Vote, All Alone
The Senate chamber seems surprisingly small at night.
From the gallery, visitors look down on the members, who sit at square oak desks in a semicircle around the well, their faces illuminated from below, as if by footlights, from the reflected shine of brass reading lamps on each desk.
It has become easy over the years for reporters and maybe a lot of other people to see this formal room, with its stage lighting and faux marble as a kind of theater where nothing real takes place.
The speeches are usually prepared and often rehearsed, bored lobbyists can mouth each member's favorite cliche as it is delivered, and nothing deepens the voice or straightens the posture of a senator more than the stare of a television camera.
It is not hard to think: noble setting, petty motives.


June 25 - July 1: Affirmative Action; Administration Scrambles To Get Into Line With the New Rules
As the Clinton Administration tries to figure out which Federal affirmative action programs are fair, effective or possibly outdated, it is confronted with a fact it cannot ignore: Under new rules it can't control, some are clearly illegal.
The Supreme Court ruled on June 12 that any program that doles out benefits on the basis of race has to be "narrowly tailored" and meet a "compelling national interest." Now, faced with possible lawsuits to challenge Federal affirmative action programs, the Administration has had to act quickly.
Last week, the Justice Department sent out a 38-page legal opinion to Federal agencies with guidelines to see if their programs can pass the new test.
The questions raised in the memo and some of its directives challenged long-standing justifications for affirmative action.
The idea of promoting diversity by itself is no longer good enough.
But even if Federal programs pass the legal test, the question remains whether they will pass political examination.
For that, stay tuned.

Are Cold-Calling Brokers Making You Crazy?
THE BEEF: Richard L. Berman of Rockville, Md., says he has been inundated with harassing calls by stockbrokers who largely pitch him schlock.
And he is steaming because he says the brokers persist in calling him despite his requests to be put on "do not call" lists.
At the same time, he has opened accounts with several of the brokers, which has only set him up to receive more calls.
THE BROKERS: Americorp Securities has incurred the wrath of Mr.
Berman for its persistent telephone calls, as have Duke &amp; Company and Lew Lieberbaum &amp; Company, among a half-dozen others.


Thinking Person
To the Editor:

Interior Designers Lend Their Skills to Communal Spaces
IF a visitor asks the interior designer Alice Burnham which project is her favorite, she won't tell you it's the fabulous waterfront house in Connecticut, she won't tell you it's the chic Manhattan apartment and she won't tell you it's the villa in Florida.
Instead, she will beam with pride about an AIDS hospice in Georgetown, a shelter for young people in Greenwich, the Ronald McDonald House in New Haven or a community center in New Canaan.
Those are just a few of the pro bono jobs she and other Connecticut members of the American Society of Interior Designers have enthusiastically taken on -- at no benefit to themselves other than feeling good.


Corrections

Be Glad This One Is Too Costly
SOMETIMES hoi polloi have it better.
In a red-hot market for new technology stocks, for example, the resulting high prices and lack of access can protect many regular folks from themselves.
But costly errors are still possible.
Consider Legato Systems, which plans to go public this month.
Based in Palo Alto, Calif., it develops networking software designed to store the huge amount of data that corporations are now keeping on groups of computers rather than on mainframes.


The Nation; At the Fed, It Looks Like Deja Vu, Again
THE Federal Reserve is supposed to smooth capitalism's bumps.
Its track record, however, has been oddly one-sided.
When the economy is booming, the Fed is very good at slowing it down -- reducing inflation but also making it harder for people to buy homes, keep jobs and purchase cars.
Then, a funny thing happens once the economy slows: The Fed gets reluctant to bring back prosperity.
That reluctance is very much in evidence now.
Until February, the economy was robust.
The Fed's response, given its visceral hatred of inflation, was to slow it down by doubling interest rates in the space of a year.
The slowdown came, and the urgency to act disappeared, although by law the Fed is supposed to be as quick to maintain jobs as to control inflation.


3 Fashionable Benefits Battle AIDS
THOUSANDS of people -- and thousands of dollars -- are expected at three benefits this month for the fight against AIDS.
Golf, dance, a fashion show, auctions, tennis, volleyball and three-legged races are on tap as organizations seek new ways to attract people and money as the charity season moves into full swing.
Stopping AIDS Together holds its ninth Sunday by the Bay next Sunday from noon to 6 P.M.
The event, which has raised more than $2.1 million, will be at a new location, at 99 South Howells Point Road in Bellport, where many people involved in the fashion industry have houses.


On the Desks of America, a Canvas of Self-Expression
A pair of Plexiglas dice.
A chunk of the Berlin Wall.
And a hive with 2,000 bees.
"Idiosyncratic" best describes the items people keep on their desks, The New York Times has learned from a request for readers' stories.
But "useful" -- a rubber stamp that declares, "Boring! Longer than three pages," say -- is often appropriate, too.
Here, a roundup of responses:
Isn't all life a gamble?
Malcolm Deutsch, a certified public accountant in Morro Bay, Calif., tops his desk with an antique chuck-a-luck cage, terming the hourglass-shaped gaming device with its three dice "one of my most valuable business tools."


Rice Works for Hours And Defies the Years
It is 7 o'clock and the early-morning clouds have produced a hard, steady rain.
Still, the thought of canceling the first half of the daily morning workout doesn't even enter the mind of Jerry Rice.
On this day, five people have chosen to work out with him, to get a taste of one of the most legendary and rigorous workout routines in professional sports, one that normally lasts from four to five hours.
Players like Detroit running back Barry Sanders and San Francisco Giant Barry Bonds have tried it.
And with the exception of Sanders and a few others, most have left with bruised egos and sore bodies.
Only a handful can actually finish it; even fewer return for more.


It's a Grand Old Flag, Not Just an Icon
JULY 4 approaches this year with booming demands that the Bill of Rights be amended at once to put a stop to public flag desecration.
Since this act actually occurs with less frequency than a nickel-slot jackpot, the hubbub is a sure sign of one thing: The 1996 Presidential campaign is about to bear down on us like a freight train.

An Auction And Tribute


3,000 Hits Later, a Few Words
For 19 years, Eddie Murray, despite his excellence as a major league baseball player, a man whose attainments have placed him in the category with Aaron and Mays and Pete Rose, has been a virtual mystery man to the public.
On Friday night, Murray, hitting from a low crouch, became only the 20th player in major league history to gather 3,000 hits.
And while there were headlines and an acknowledgment by the sports world of this grand achievement by the Indians' 39-year-old first baseman and designated hitter, there was little that generally seemed to touch the heart.


Cincinnati's 4 Home Runs End Mets' Winning Streak

Los Angeles Completing Market Renovation
Renovations are nearing completion on the historic open-air Grand Central Market in downtown Los Angeles.
The one-block market opened in 1917 at 317 South Broadway between Third and Fourth Streets.
It is home to dozens of restaurants, food stands and produce vendors.
As part of the renovation, the outside facade has been restored, sky lights installed and vintage neon signs erected.
The improvements are part of a $60 million program that began 10 years ago, and that includes the restoration of two turn-of-the-century buildings in the immediate vicinity and the construction of a parking garage.


The Newest Acquisitions Are Wands and Web Sites
THE SIGHT OF PEOPLE wearing headsets rushing to keep up with prerecorded tours has been commonplace in museums since such tours were introduced in 1957.
But now, thanks to the CD-ROM and the digital chip, that may soon be a thing of the past.
Museumgoers who want information can now stroll with hand-held "wands" or linger over interactive computer stations that provide information in the order they want and with varying degrees of detail.
More than 30 institutions have been offering such devices since 1993.
Many curators like the new technologies.
Maxwell Anderson, director of the Michael C. Carlos Museum in Atlanta and chairman of the technology committee of the association of museum directors, says the easily grasped information on the computers will bring more people to museums and get them to return more often.

A Direct Hit


Gentle Voice From Brazil Casts a Spell of Serenity
Gravity was suspended for two hours on Wednesday night when Gal Costa sang at Carnegie Hall.
For most of her two sets, Ms.
Costa sang ballads, bossa novas and gentle sambas that floated in their own sphere of graceful sensuality.
Ms.
Costa has been one of Brazil's leading singers since the late 1960's.
She emerged from the state of Bahia alongside the songwriters Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, whose rebellious, poetically ambitious and musically omnivorous songs changed the course of Brazilian pop.
She is still singing their material, old and new; they are still among the world's greatest songwriters.

Bronx Lobster And Defender: A Good Match
Sal Comerico is the undisputed king of Bronx lobsters, if only because no one else would ever bother to claim the title.
In fact, few care to acknowledge that such a kingdom exists: the Bronx lobster's very being, if not in doubt, is still not widely acknowledged.
Though brownish and truncated, the crustacean does exist, in the waters off City Island.
And Mr.
Comerico catches more Bronx lobster than anybody, defending it, selling it and proudly serving it with butter in his City Island restaurant, King Lobster.


New Jersey Daily Briefing; Fishy but Not Boring (So Far)
New Jersey State Aquarium officials said they were pleased with the weekend turnout as the public got its first glimpse of the newly spruced-up attraction.
Mike Krajsa, director of public affairs and marketing, said 3,561 people visited the aquarium on its opening day, Saturday, and another 3,876 yesterday.
But the real test will come later.
Attendance in 1992, the first year the aquarium was opened, was more than one million, but fell sharply amid complaints that even the fish on display were boring.


The Battle of the Bands, Part Two
Silence played a big part in the Battle of the Bands, a showdown between the jazz orchestras of Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center on Friday night at Avery Fisher Hall.
The concert, in its second year as part of the JVC Jazz Festival, featured two orchestras at their peak.
Silence was part of the huge arsenal brought by both bands to the show: in stop-time sections and as part of false beginnings and endings, it appeared in just about any form, one of the many tricks meant to grab an audience's attention and win the fight.


Waiter, Oh, Waiter! Excuuuse Me, but There's a Mouse in My Coffee!
In the middle of Harvard Square is a new hot spot, a cafe offering coffee, croissants and all that is new in the malls of cyberspace.
The cafe, Cyber smith, is not just another hangout for techies.
It is set up to appeal to the many who don't know the first thing about navigating in the new technopolis.
At Cybersmith, personal computers line the counters and customers can sip cappuccinos while surfing the Internet.
Those who prefer to sit at booths have a selection of specialties to choose from, like "Internet Access" and "CD-ROM and Multimedia." And customers -- from 7 to 70 years old -- can sit and experiment, with a staff of "technosmiths" to help them with any problems.


New Jersey Daily Briefing; Bigger Berries, Lower Prices
Dennis Doyle, the manager of Tru-Blu Cooperative in New Lisbon, has seen a lot of blueberries in his time, but he says this year's berries are the largest he has ever harvested.
Favorable spring conditions are the reason.
"Whatever makes us comfortable makes blueberries comfortable," he said.
But since the weather was good in other blueberry-growing states, Mr.
Doyle predicts that consumers will not only find the large berries they are seeking but will also like the price.
"There's quite a few berries around," he said, noting that a lot of other states are now in the blueberry business.


An Erotic Dream For Seamier Times
One of the most celebrated images in 20th-century ballet is that of Vaslav Nijinsky wearing a rose-petal costume in "Le Spectre de la Rose." In Michel Fokine's neo-Romantic ballet of 1911, this spirit of a rose appears in a dream to a young woman who returns from a ball and falls asleep with a rose in her hand.
Nijinsky called his role "too pretty." Angelin Preljocaj, the 39-year-old French choreographer whose company performed at the American Dance Festival here on Saturday night, might agree.
In his harsh, unsentimental version of the ballet, the rose-covered figure is a flasher in a short raincoat who ravishes a sleeping woman.
Surprisingly and impressively, this reinterpretation is anything but a provocation; the new production, which received its United States premiere here, is powerful on its own terms and a persuasive gloss on the erotic dream that Fokine's ballet treated with subliminal sophistication in its own time.


Technology: ON THE NET; Out, damned geek! The typical Web user is no longer packing a pocket protector.
IS the Internet's World Wide Web becoming a mainstream medium?
Apparently so, according to consumer research by a University of Michigan marketing professor, who sees the Web expanding the Internet's audience well beyond its techie core.
"It's the end of geekdom," said Sunil Gupta, who has spent much of the last year gathering data on how people use the Web and their attitudes about the new medium.
"This technology is still available only to technologically literate households," he noted.
"But it has moved beyond the university and corporate domination of the past."


Tory Infighting Highlights Labor's Comeback
As they debate whether to dump John Major as their leader and select a new Prime Minister, Britain's governing Conservatives are staring not only into their own political souls, but into the face of the opposition Labor Party.
And if they are unnerved by their internal divisions, the Tories are downright scared by Labor's growing electoral strength.
Labor is benefiting in part from simply not being the Tories, who after 16 years in power are running at record lows in public opinion polls.


In America; Let Them Eat Poison
In the summer of 1993, Alex Donley was 6 years old.
He had just graduated from kindergarten.
One day he did the most routine of things.
He ate a hamburger.
Four days later he was dead.
He died horribly.
"Nearly all of the organs in Alex's body were destroyed," said his mother, Nancy Donley.
"Portions of his brain were liquefied. That's how virulent a pathogen this is. My husband and I wanted to donate his organs and have him live on in another child, but we couldn't. We were able to donate his corneas. That's all."


Fan With Gun Arrested in Alomar Threat
A distraught female fan seeking a relationship with ROBERTO ALOMAR went to the Skydome with a loaded pistol yesterday apparently intent on killing the Toronto Blue Jays second baseman, the police said.
TRICIA MILLER, 31, a factory worker from Port Hope, Ontario, was arrested at the Skydome hotel while Alomar was playing in Toronto's 9-7 loss to Baltimore.
Alomar, who lives at the hotel during the season, was removed from the game in the ninth inning because the police wanted to speak to him immediately.

CHRONICLE
When GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ, the Colombian author, strolled backstage at the Plymouth Theater on Broadway after yesterday's performance of "Chronicle of a Death Foretold," the cast treated him like the star of the show with tears, screams, pleas for autographs and even a couple of genuflections.
"I started to cry when I embraced him," said GRACIELA DANIELE, the director and choreographer, whose stylish dance-drama about betrayal and murder in a small South American village was based on Mr.
Garcia Marquez's novel of the same name.
"Why? Because when you're embracing God you feel this way."

BUSINESS DIGEST
Buying American Goods, Through the Japanese Mail  If the recent Japanese-American trade dispute gives the impression that American goods are being held at bay in Japan, consider the near-doubling in the last year of one segment of American exports.
A growing revolt by Japanese consumers is fighting high prices with an American retailing custom: mail-order shopping.
Clothing, camping gear and cosmetics are arriving in record quantity.  [ Page 1. ] A Grimmer Reality on the Job  The economy may be starting to sputter.
The fray has drawn members of the Government opposition charging the Prime Minister with nepotism, a regulatory agency complaining that its authority is being undermined and consumer groups protecting their interests.  [ 39. ] Tug-of-War Over Food Safety  Congress is to consider legislation that would sharply change rules on food safety.
Scattered through several bills, the changes would lessen the burden on business to prove food is safe, increase it on agencies to prove that proposed rules are worth the cost and expand the industry's opportunity to appeal.  [ 1. ] S.E.C.

For on-line users, the researcher said, "It's the end of geekdom." Steve Lohr: On the Net.  [ 39. ] On World's TV, Life's a Beach  America's most pervasive cultural export is a TV show that was canceled after one season on NBC, has never earned an award or any critical respect.
But "Baywatch," which stars David Hasselhoff and is nominally about the adventures of California lifeguards, has a wider audience on the planet than any other entertainment show ever.
Bill Carter: Television.  [ 41. ] For Cartoonists, a Fading Glory  Editorial cartoonists say they are incisive social analysts whose wit can change the course of current events.
But they fear they are becoming the buggy-whip makers of American journalism, accessorizers to a business -- newspapers -- that is the industry's horse-drawn carriage.  [ 41. ]


The Future, in the Words of Gingrich
Speaker Newt Gingrich's new book, "To Renew America," is an effort to distill for the general public his dread of the "welfare state" and his hopes for the computerized future.
There are no startling revelations, either personal or political, in the book, which has spurred Democratic attacks and complaints to the House ethics committee since Mr.
Gingrich agreed to a $4.5 million advance.
In the face of Democratic criticism, he later rejected the advance, accepting instead a 15 percent royalty, or $3.60 on every copy of the $24 book sold.

Editorial Notebook; Wrapping the Reichstag
Part of the delight of a project by Christo is that everyone gets to be a critic.
You too can have a theory about the artist's wrapping of the Reichstag in a million square feet of polypropylene fabric.
Some might consider Christo's accomplishment self-indulgent and banal.
But I love the way that hulk of a building has been transformed into a delicate and spectral presence, forcing visitors to contemplate a familiar landmark in a fresh way.
Since the Reichstag is to be renovated as the new headquarters of the German Parliament, Christo has also provided the means for a notorious symbol of German imperialism, Nazi villainy and cold-war confrontation to be literally unwrapped as a symbol of a nation's reunification and rebirth.
If that sounds too pompous, think of the delicious absurdity of President Reagan lobbying Chancellor Helmut Kohl during a break at the Venice G-7 summit meeting in 1987 to let the project proceed.
Think of Chancellor Kohl, grumpily opposed to the wrapping as a trivialization of German aspirations, refusing to go see it even though he was in Berlin.
No matter.
Like all of Christo's projects, it is transitory, rendering his vision both arrogant and modest.
The landscape always returns to its original state.

To the Editor:
Our Government, from its highest health officer, the Surgeon General, has issued warnings about smoking and health.
Warnings appear on every cigarette package that smoking may be hazardous to health.

CONGRESS MOVING TO REVAMP RULES ON FOOD SAFETY
In the next few weeks, Congress will consider legislation to alter rules on food safety drastically.
The changes, scattered throughout several bills, have been proposed by the Republicans to limit the Federal Government's authority to regulate not only food safety but also health and the environment.
Taken together, the bills would reduce the burden on businesses to prove that food is safe and would increase the burden on Government agencies to prove that proposed rules would reduce risks to the public and would be worth the cost.
The bills would also expand the food industry's chances to appeal the rules in court.

At Home Abroad; Paradise Enow?
Generations of American visitors have fallen in love with Italy.
It offered what home so often did not: beauty, passion, history, sensuality in food and clothes and life.
With their revolving governments, Italians might not order their politics as efficiently as we did; but they knew how to live.
What few of us noticed, in our romance, was that postwar Italy carried off an economic miracle.
It made itself the world's fifth-largest industrial economy.
And it did that, handling the resulting social strains without compromising individual liberty.

1915 Knoxville, With an Urban Accent
You don't think of Samuel Barber's melancholic "Knoxville: Summer of 1915" as an urban piece.
But during the opening Summergarden concert Friday night at the Museum of Modern Art, Barber's setting of James Agee's poetic memoir of a small Southern city of 80 years ago seemed not so far removed from midtown Manhattan today.
Hearing music in the museum's Sculpture Garden may not be quite as homey an experience as "rocking gently and talking gently" on porches in the Knoxville of 1915.
But the walled garden provided an equivalent sense of seclusion.
The peace and quiet of this Knoxville summer evening are interrupted by automobiles and buggies and "a streetcar raising its iron moan." And there were plenty of iron moans coming from West 54th Street, including, for a while, a buzzing power saw.
But it didn't matter.
The performance was affecting.

The excerpts, to be sung in French with English surtitles under the direction of Gabriel Guimaraes, are Act I of Alberic Magnard's 1901 tragedy "Guercoeur," the love scene from "Le Roi Arthus," composed in 1895 by Ernest Chausson, and the last act of Ernest Reyer's 1884 opera "Sigurd."

A New Kind of Suburbia Arises Out of the New Jersey Farmlands
Twenty years ago, fields of corn, barley and wheat stretched for hundreds of acres in all directions from the crossing of South Middlebush Road and Claremont Road here in southern Somerset County.
But in the last decade, the cropland has vanished.
Now the area is filled with 2,600 new single-family homes, garden apartments and town houses.
To city dwellers and even residents of the older, close-in suburbs, these new outlying developments, like the Wynnefield Village town houses and garden apartments, seem isolated.


QUALITY IS FOCUS FOR HEALTH PLANS
At a meeting quietly convened at a mountain house in the Grand Tetons of Wyoming, representatives of some of the largest employers and purchasers of health insurance agreed last week to pursue a fundamental shift in emphasis in the nation's managed health-care systems: They want the primary focus to be placed on measuring the quality of care now that costs have begun to be controlled.
The broad-based agreement was reached at Jackson Hole last week by 30 officials of Federal, state and local public employees organizations, consumer groups and officials of such major employers as American Express, the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the Ameritech Corporation and Pepsico, which together represent an estimated 80 million consumers of health insurance.

Cyprus Respects Law

Re "Cyprus Shores Wash Dirty Money" (news article, June 15):


Young Starters Get the Call
Still unsure whether they want to or need to obtain a starter, the Yankees will probably summon two more young pitchers from Class AAA Columbus for starts against the White Sox Tuesday and Wednesday.
If they promote Mariano Rivera and Brian Boehringer, as expected, the Yankees will have three rookies and one starter in his first full season in the rotation.
If Rivera and Boehringer had not already stumbled in brief stints in the majors, the moves would be considered routine because both right-handers have excelled at Class AAA.
Rivera is 2-1 with a 1.17 earned run average, pitched a five-inning no-hitter against Rochester in his last start and has a streak of 20 2/3 scoreless innings.
Boehringer is 2-3 with a 1.55 e.r.a.
The Yankees hope the two pitchers will form an effective kiddie corps with Sterling Hitchcock and Andy Pettitte.

Critics Troubled By Computer Study On Pornography
A new study, which concludes that the exchange of sex-related images is "one of the largest (if not the largest) recreational applications of users of computer networks," is being challenged as unscientific and sensationalistic by opponents of Government regulation of those networks.
The study -- conducted a year ago by a student at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and published last week in the Georgetown Law Journal -- has intensified the debate over indecent material on the Internet, galvanizing both those who favor tighter Government controls on the information networks and those who fear the erosion of First Amendment rights in cyberspace.

New Jersey Daily Briefing; Sightings in a Jail's Final Days
The old Hudson County Jail, which shut down in 1990 because of overcrowding, was demolished yesterday, but the seven-story structure did not give up the ghost without a fight.
Six whacks with the wrecking ball were needed to dislodge the first bricks -- a circumstance likely to confirm rumors that the jail, built in 1926, is haunted.
Workers cutting up the steel cages inside the jail during the past month have reported hearing ghoulish laughter and seeing tools make mysterious movements.
Eugene Neapolitan, a foreman on the wrecking job, wrote "Happy the Ghost" on his hard hat after what he claims was a sighting of the spirit.

In Schools, Subtle Pressure To Change Students' Grades
Principals and teachers around New York City say that the pressure to reassess the grades of failing students -- as a high school principal did last week -- surfaces in subtle ways.
They describe the case of Robert Durkin, the principal of Washington Irving High School in Manhattan, as an extreme case.
He was removed last week for giving 17 failing seniors extra homework and permitting them to graduate.
He bypassed the authority of teachers, who reported him to Board of Education officials.

With its mixture of early-20th-century modernism and contemporary jazz improvisations, the piece swelled into something new and important, and the audience gave the performance a standing ovation.
Mr.
Roberts was backed by a string section from the Orchestra of St.
Luke's, his own trio and parts of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, and for the most part they performed well, from the opening clarinet figure to the dissonant string writing.
Mr.
Roberts teased the audience with solo sections that breezed through moments of stride piano only to stop or wander into less rhythmic territory.
The improvisational sections featured competitive duets between two trumpeters or two trombonists, and at times the music seemed on the verge of boiling over, barely able to contain its vitality.


New Internet Feature Will Make Voluntary Ratings Possible
A consortium of 59 companies, including the nation's leading hardware and software concerns, is planning to change the Internet's most popular software, making it possible to create rating systems similar to those used in the movie and video-game business to warn of violent or sexual content.
The new software feature, to be added later this summer to the Internet's popular World Wide Web service, will allow parents, schools and other organizations to use a rating system to screen categories of material from children or from anyone who might find it objectionable.


How Foes Unraveled Apartheid
One lesson of the 1980's is that in the commotions of nations, happy endings are neither common nor permanent: dictatorships fall amid rejoicing, only to be replaced by floundering, corrupt or authoritarian regimes.
But South Africa, of all places, has produced a heartening transformation: apartheid peacefully replaced by what looks to be (fingers crossed) a multiracial democracy led by a hero in the form of Nelson Mandela.
How that came about is the subject of "Mandela's Fight for Freedom," a far more revealing report than the cliche of a title suggests.
In three fascinating hours, the main players on all sides of a complex and periodically murderous political standoff tell of the pressures that forced them to the negotiating table and of the tactics -- through a decade of mostly closed-door talks -- that resulted in a peaceful accommodation.


Auction This Week Features Only Bills
The Treasury's schedule of finan cings this week is limited to today's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills.

Patents; A hybrid car, with battery and internal combustion engine, may be the bridge to a fully electric auto.
MANY people await the even greater changes in car design and performance that will come with electric automobiles.
But manufacturers now say that some sort of hybrid vehicle will be on the roads before a purely electric car is perfected.
The hybrid would run on a gas-fueled internal-combustion engine, but would use a highly efficient battery to raise mileage to about 80 miles a gallon.
A Ringwood, N.J., company said it has patented just such a cell using technology from space satellite batteries.
Philip A. Burghart, a senior vice-president of Ergenics Inc., predicted his company's battery would allow drivers to travel up to 300 miles before recharging, and would vastly increase mileage performance in hybrid gas-electric cars.

But they can't change without help." -- JOSEPH A. CALIFANO JR.  [ 26:1. ]


Fox's Powerful Role in Children's TV
In August 1993, after Margaret Loesch, president of the Fox Children's Network, decided to put a show called "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" on her fall schedule, she sent videotapes of several episodes to Lucie S. Salhany, then head of Fox Broadcasting.
Then Ms.
Loesch went on vacation.
The next day a fax came from Ms.
Salhany, urging that "Power Rangers" be shelved.
"Maybe I'm too old," the message continued, "but I think this will be a disaster."


An Effort to Protect a Reservoir Is Attacked by Environmentalists
Emie Barnes paused in her daily jog along Route 120 to catch her breath and describe how she watched in horror over the last three weeks as a three-and-a-half-mile chain-link fence went up around a portion of the picturesque Kensico Reservoir.
"First they cleared brush and set out flags and tags, then came the posts, and when the fence went up, I said, 'Oh God,' " said Ms.
Barnes, who lives in Chappaqua in Westchester County.
"This was one of the prettiest stretches of road I know. Now it looks like the Bronx."


Reviving Frescoes (and a Debate on Art)
For centuries, the mysterious power in plaster and color that adorns a small papal chapel here was locked from prying eyes.
But with a solemn Mass by a representative of Pope John Paul II, the Vatican recently unveiled eight frescoes in the chapel, known as the Sancta Sanctorum, and in so doing revived an impassioned debate over the origins of Renaissance art.

Why Studios Bet On the Summer Blockbuster; With Bid Debts and Big Budgets, Hir are More Critical Than Ever
Even before "Apollo 13" opened on Friday and generated an estimated -- and stunning -- $26 million at the box office in its first weekend, Tom Pollock, chairman of the MCA Motion Picture Group, was pretty sure he had a hit on his hands.
The early word was positive from critics who had previewed the film in recent weeks.
And if Mr.
Pollack needed further reassurance it came last Monday evening after a Manhattan screening for a tough crowd: 1,150 people who work in the entertainment industry.
When the closing credits started to roll, the hard-bitten group broke into applause.


Newest British Star Hits Pretty Hard, Eh?
A month ago, just after this nation's hyperactive oddsmakers gloomily estimated the chances of a reincarnated Fred Perry turning up in time to win Wimbledon at 1,000-to-1, a turncoat dressed in white and carrying a smoking racquet arrived on the scene.
Not since Perry's victory in 1936 has a British man won this coveted singles championship, but as soon as a towering 21-year-old Canadian with the 137 mile-an-hour serve and a ranking of 60th jumped across the Atlantic, the odds on a Briton dropped to a manageable 50-1.
On Monday, with all 13,000 of the Center Court's spectators poised to adopt his cause the way he has adopted their country, Greg Rusedski will try to justify his sudden celebrity, and the epic amount of pressure that accompanies it, with a fourth-round upset of Pete Sampras, Wimbledon's two-time defending champion.
Helped along by his English mother, Helen, but sought after primarily because he owns the world's fastest serve, the hired gun was promptly installed as the British No. 1.
The snub to the nation's incumbents caused at least one British player to quit the country's Davis Cup squad, and Rusedski's first-round losses at Nottingham and Queen's Club in his first two events as a Briton seemed to suggest the controversial conversion might have been a flop.
But now 77 aces and three rounds deep into Wimbledon, a frontier no other British player has crossed this year in singles, Rusedski has stolen the scene if not the hearts of his fellow players.
Andre Agassi has sneered about Rusedski's new way with the British vernacular: they don't use words like "telly," "blokes" and "brilliant" back in Montreal, a city where Rusedski claims to have spent 16 formative years without learning how to play hockey.
He was, he said, escorted directly onto a tennis court by his father, who dreamed that his 7-year-old son might one day do what he could not: take on Ivan Lendl.
Instead, Rusedski is taking on the No. 2 player in the world, the player whose game and accomplishments epitomize what he aspires to.
Although Rusedski may have fired the world's fastest serve, it is Sampras who has been immortalized in the act of serving on Wimbledon T-shirts.
Doubtless Rusedski will not be receiving any further tennis lessons from Sampras, who claimed not to remember the results of a two-set practice session they had back in Tampa, Fla., in the days when Rusedski was just a 117th-ranked Canadian prospect and not the venerated British No. 1.
"I don't remember a lot of my practice matches; that's why they're practice," he sniped after being told that the gregarious Rusedski recalled splitting sets with Sampras, who at the time was ranked No. 1.
This weekend, Sampras expressed reluctance to give up his practice court to "a British player," as Wimbledon protocol requires that the top British player gets solo court time upon request, once he saw that the player in the wings was Rusedski.
Sampras also said that regardless of what any radar gun decrees, he believes Goran Ivanisevic's serve is superior to Rusedski's.
Sampras said he found it ironic that Wimbledon, in retaliation against the rally-less final he and Ivanisevic played here last year, selected this year to debut softer, slower balls in the hope of reducing aces and enhancing rallies -- obviously a decision arrived at before Rusedski arrived to save the day.
"Maybe next year they'll use golf balls," Sampras said.
Sampras added: "There's not a whole lot of strategy involved when you play someone like him. He's got a big serve, he's lefty, and whenever you get those two things on grass it's going to be a tough match. And he's obviously filled with a lot of emotion. Hopefully I can get off to a good start and put him out of the match." Sampras apparently didn't notice that the same strategy failed miserably for 16th-seeded Guy Forget against Rusedski in the second round.
Rusedski admitted that his own game will need to be perfect if he expects to give the defending champion significant trouble.
Rusedski, whose only previous Wimbledon experience was a second-round loss last year, needed all 36 aces he launched in his 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) escape from the clutches of Olivier Delaitre of France in the third round.
"I will really have to serve well if I'm going to do well against Pete, so I'm not going to go out on a limb and make predictions," said Rusedski, who currently lives in Surrey with the family of his girlfriend, Lucy Connor.
He met her four years ago when she was a ball girl for one of his matches.
Meantime, Wimbledon is keeping its grass short, the better to create a sympathetic environment for the bullets of its hired gun -- a tactic that, unfortunately for the home country's hopes, also plays right into the hands of Sampras and the other big servers in the Round of 16, the fourth-seeded Ivanisevic and third-seeded Boris Becker.
Still, the mood is jubilant for this eager transplant who insists he "feels British."
"This is why I came over here," he said.
"I love the country. I feel British completely."
That's something Sampras, Agassi, and Ivanisevic, and not even the citizen-of-the-world Becker, will ever say.


Media: TELEVISION; Stand aside, CNN. America's No. 1 TV export is -- no scoffing, please -- 'Baywatch.'
AMERICA'S most pervasive cultural export is a television show that was canceled after one season on NBC, has never earned an award or even any critical respect for dramatic excellence and is often derisively called "Babewatch."
But facts are facts.
"Baywatch," which is about the adventures of lifeguards on a California beach but is really mostly about swimwear and suntan lotion, has a wider audience on the planet Earth than any other entertainment show in history.

He was expected to go on the 15-day disabled list today.


A Season of Vacant Seats
Two months into the strike-delayed 1995 baseball season, the ballpark can be a lonely place.
Attendance is down 20 percent compared with a year ago.
Home runs and long foul balls clatter around acres of empty seats at many stadiums.
Sometimes there are hardly enough paying customers to generate a respectable cheer.
Baseball fans are clearly disillusioned by the long stalemate between the millionaire owners and millionaire players that prematurely ended the 1994 season and produced the first autumn in 89 years without a World Series.
When play resumed in April under pressure from a Federal judge, with the labor dispute unresolved, many fans apparently decided they were not going to spend a penny more on the sport.
Free hot dogs and other sales gimmicks borrowed from Bill Veeck and Charles Finley, Barnumesque owners of an earlier era, have failed to lure back the fans.

Flooding Turns Town Into 'Lunar Landscape'
When violent thunderstorms hit and swollen creeks flooded central Virginia last week, this small farming town tucked among the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains found itself caught in the middle.
Kinsey Run and the Rapidan River broke their banks in the valley below, and boulders and mud slid down from the mountains above.
Much of what was in between just washed away.
"This was the most beautiful place in the world," said Susan Hull, who spent a large part of her childhood here and returned today to help clean the mud out of her family's old plantation house.
"I guess you can still get a sense of that, even though there is this lunar landscape."

Job Insecurity: A special report.; In New Work World, Employers Call All the Shots
Not so long ago, American workers would suffer the sting of a recession by losing jobs or having their hours or wages reduced.
They responded by taking part-time work, signing with temp agencies and just making do -- at least until the economy revived.
Then they would pour back to work, their wages rising as employers competed for their services.
Not anymore.
Recent reports suggest that the economy is starting to sputter after perking along for the four years since the last recession.
But whatever the economy's prospects, the latest stretch of growth shows that for all but professionals, executives, new college graduates, and the most skilled blue-collar workers, many problems that workers faced only in bad times have become fixtures in all times: Some wages are still falling, people must be ready to work 12-hour shifts and 6-day weeks, and no job is for keeps.

The City's Disappointing Labor Deal
A package of $600 million in labor concessions announced hours before the start of a new fiscal year on Saturday has led Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to proclaim that New York City's budget has at last been balanced.
But the package falls disappointingly short of the Mayor's original goal.
Many promised savings remain unidentified, and the package failed to save money by changing work rules that have impeded productivity.
If the city is to achieve long-term financial health, the Mayor must get more from the unions.
The labor package was the third act in a fiscal drama that began in February, when Mr.
Giuliani projected a $3.1 billion deficit for the next fiscal year.
First, he pushed the Legislature in Albany, with limited success, to cut welfare and Medicaid costs and provide a modest amount of state aid.
Second, he drove his own painful budget cuts through the City Council.
Now he has tackled wages and benefits, which constitute half of the entire city budget, making the last act in some ways the most critical.

Krone Unhurt, 2 Horses Die
Julie Krone and Jean-Luc Samyn escaped serious injury yesterday when their horses suffered broken ankles in unrelated accidents during the seventh race at Belmont Park.
Neither Krone, who has undergone three operations in the past two years to repair injuries suffered in violent spills, nor Samyn was injured, but both horses were destroyed by injection.
The spills occurred two races before the 78th running of the Dwyer, which was won by the 2-1 favorite Hoolie, a 3-year-old son of Criminal Type who stretched his winning streak to four races.
He stalked Reality Road for the entire mile and a sixteenth and caught him near the finish to win by a length and a quarter.
Reality Road fought off D. Wayne Lukas's Western Larla by a head for second.
Hoolie covered the distance in 1:423/5 on a muddy track and paid $6.60.


Drug Therapy: Powerful Tool Reaching Few Inside Prisons
On a summer night as sweet and soft as any he had ever known, Pierre Mathurin and another young man pulled to the curb in a quiet section of Queens, snorted a couple of lines of cocaine and set out down the sidewalk.
They had spotted a man and a woman strolling alone, and now they were going after them, Mr.
Mathurin's fingers tightening on a chrome-plated .25-caliber pistol.
It was just a week shy of Mr.
Mathurin's 20th birthday, and his career as a drug dealer and robber was gathering momentum nicely.
But that evening did not go as expected.
The woman screamed, and Mr.
Mathurin, fleeing with a wallet and a gold chain, was chased down by neighbors with baseball bats, turned over to the police and eventually sent to a prison drug treatment program that transformed his life.


Politics Take Center Court as Yugoslavs Win Title
Midway through the European basketball championships, Vlade Divac had said, "Sports and politics should not go together."

Anti-Poverty Program Under Fire in Mexico
Every Sunday, no matter how hot it gets in this fiery land between the desert and the sea, Joel Incunza Contreras and the Campo Plata Harvesters play at least nine innings of baseball at a new stadium, which they built with $30,000 from the anti-poverty program that was a trademark of the former President, Carlos Salinas.
Critics have asserted that such spending by the program, known as Solidarity, has done nothing to ease Mexico's grinding poverty.
Nor, they say, have the millions of Solidarity dollars spent all over Mexico in the last six years to build more than 2,000 basketball courts, dozens of gymnasiums and enough baseball stadiums to support a league.

Israeli and Palestinian leaders tried to pick up the pieces of their failed peace negotiations today, promising to resume talks soon but cautioning that they are still far apart on how to reach their goal of widening Palestinian self-rule.
The two sides had set July 1 as their target for an agreement, a date chosen months ago almost at random but one that had increasingly assumed symbolic importance.
They came up empty, though, despite talks that had dragged on for more than eight hours, through Saturday night and into today.

This Yankee Loss From the Strange-but-True Department
The developments on the field at County Stadium had given the afternoon a goofy backdrop: The Yankees misplayed a fly ball into a triple the first time a Milwaukee player swung the bat, made two other errors, ran the bases recklessly and had trouble with a rookie's fluttering knuckleball.
So when the San Diego Chicken made an unannounced appearance and three adults dressed in costumes depicting different sausage products chugged around the field, it was strangely fitting.
Was the real Goofy hiding in the bullpen?
Manager Buck Showalter was not smiling, though, because there was nothing goofy about his Yankees' 7-6 loss to the Brewers.
Not when the rookie Steve Sparks adeptly overcame three Brewer errors and confounded hitter after hitter.
Not when the Yankees left the potential tying run on second base after scoring three runs in the eighth inning.
Not when their last chance wilted in the ninth after Luis Polonia was out for being hit near the left eye by Wade Boggs's chopping grounder near second base.

Newark school officials have said that if the takeover is approved, they will try to block it through the courts.
The State Education Commissioner, Leo F. Klagholz, has recommended the takeover, citing the school's district low test scores and high dropout rates.
But Newark school officials say they have not been allowed to make their case for retaining control.

Medleys, Messages And Tape
In decades past, pop musicians were expected to perform their music live.
Using backing tapes was a short cut suitable for television shows, not for live concerts.
But with the advent of hip-hop and other forms of electronically based pop music, playing taped music has become de rigueur at some concerts.
On Friday night at the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., during the Summer Jam organized by WQHT-FM radio, known as Hot 97, there was not a single live instrument on stage as seven urban-music groups, each of which has had at least one top-five single in the past few months, performed for the sold-out crowd.


Condom Controversy in a Park
Last year, the All Saints Lutheran Parish in the South Bronx gave out about 1,500 condoms at its annual basketball tournament.
Yesterday, it was able to give out only about 300 -- the result of a dispute with the city, which does not want them given away in parks at all.
The parish was facing a ban on condom distribution until the New York Civil Liberties Union sued the city on the church's behalf last week.
And it was not until the organization's lawyers found an appeals court judge at home on Saturday night that the parish received limited permission to hand out condoms to anyone 16 years or older who specifically requested one.

Several of the 66 rifles and shotguns and 8 handguns stolen from an Arkansas gun collector have been matched to weapons seized in a search of the Herrington, Kan., home of Terry L. Nichols, one of two suspects being held in the bombing, Federal officials say.
That search, conducted shortly after the bombing, netted 33 weapons.


Weiskopf Wins First Major Title In U.S.
The moment Tom Weiskopf had long waited for arrived today at the United States Senior Open, and a small pink ribbon pinned to his cap helped him keep his focus to get there.
Weiskopf captured his first major American championship, at the Congressional Country Club, showing a mastery of every shot and running away from the field for a final round 68 that left him 13 under par for the tournament and four shots better than the second-place finisher, Jack Nicklaus.

A.L.'s All-Star Lineup Is Heavy on Indians
Voting for baseball's All-Star Game plummeted this year, but the Cleveland Indians performed so well at the ballot box that their 1996 payroll will feel the results.
The awesome Indians, who in the previous 25 years of fan balloting had only three players elected as starters a total of five times, had two players, second baseman Carlos Baerga and left fielder Albert Belle, elected and four others selected for the American League roster.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Bartering is big for media companies. And it may get bigger with insurance for trade credits.
CORPORATE barter has long been used by many producers of goods and services, especially to acquire advertising time and space.
In 1994 alone, the value of barter transactions in the United States exceeded $7.5 billion, up from about $7 billion the previous year.
In addition to direct exchanges between, say, a manufacturer of widgets and a publisher of a widget trade magazine, there is also a thriving business these days in trade finance -- the use of credits as a form of payment to manufacturers when transferring unsalable inventory to a third party.
Such credits could be used, for example, when a barter, or trading, company already controls blocks of time and space for advertising.


Lewis Rabbage, 63, Miniatures Collector
Lewis Hoyer Rabbage, a New York businessman who was a leading collector of American portrait miniatures, died on Tuesday at his sister's home in New Canaan, Conn..
He was 63.
The cause was cancer, said Susan Strickler, curator of American art at the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts, to which Mr.
Rabbage donated many works.


In Canada, Satellite Digital TV Stirs Row
Fifty thousand Canadian "gray marketeers" who can't do without small-dish satellite television have touched off a war here between telecommunications titans over who will provide the service.
Jumping into the fray are members of the Government opposition charging the Prime Minister with nepotism, a communications regulatory agency complaining that its authority is being undermined and consumer groups protecting their interests.
On one side of the battle is Expressvu, a consortium of three of Canada's biggest electronics and communications companies, which had been scheduled to offer, beginning Sept. 1, direct broadcast from satellite, or D.B.S., television.
This service, also known as the Digital Satellite System, not only provides images and sound that are close to laser disk quality but also upward of 100 channels, including pay TV.


Wolfman Jack, 57, Raspy Voice of Rock-and-Roll on the Radio
Wolfman Jack, the rock-and-roll disk jockey whose unmistakable raspy voice and on-the-air howls brought him something of a cult following as one of America's best-known radio personalities, died on Saturday at his home in Belvidere, N.C.
He was 57.
The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter, Joy Renee Smith of Belvidere.


Courts Put Safety First in Drug Tests
In 1986, the baseball coach at McCutcheon High School in the Tippecanoe County School Corporation in Indianapolis, having heard of possible drug use, ordered 16 team members to provide urine samples.
Five students' tests proved positive for marijuana.
From this event as well as parents' concern over the high incidence of drug abuse among students nationwide, the school board instituted a random urine-testing program for athletes and cheerleaders in the school system.
Two students, Darcy Schaill and Shelley Johnson, then 15, went out for varsity sports but changed their minds after being told they would have to undergo a urine test as a condition of playing.
They were offended by the policy, they said.
They later filed a Federal court complaint that said their rights against unlawful search and seizure and due process had been violated.

Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia's Prime Minister, is widely seen as a potential successor to President Boris N. Yeltsin.
Since becoming Prime Minister in December 1992, Mr.

He has developed a sophisticated new understanding of macroeconomics and of political survival, nurtured a close relationship with Vice President Al Gore and disclosed a new humanity to Russians when he negotiated an end to the hostage crisis in Budyonnovsk.


Berlin Journal; As All Eyes Turn East, Streets Will Soon Bloom
For more than a decade, Fofi's Estiatorio has been a favorite spot for chic Berliners to see and be seen.
Writers, politicians and show business stars favor it not just for its arty feel and fine food, but also for its location on a handsome tree-shaded street just off the glittering Kurfurstendamm.
But the restaurant's Greek-born owner, Photini Akrithakis, has just made a business decision that would have been unthinkable only a couple of years ago.
After assessing the future of what has for years been Berlin's most elegant neighborhood, she has decided to pack up and move her restaurant to the former East Berlin.


Acting on Tip, Police Discover an Arsenal of Guns and Explosives
Acting on a tip that a Queens man was running a gun-rental operation for criminals, police officers said they uncovered a closet full of weapons and explosives during a raid on the man's Corona apartment.
The weapons discovered Saturday at the home of Arecio Collado included three hand grenades, a remote-controlled bomb, a .45-caliber machine gun with a silencer, a rifle and a shotgun, a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun and two bulletproof vests, a police spokesman said.
He called it one of the largest stashes of illegal weapons the department has turned up in recent years.

Around the Queens housing complex where 17-year-old Cynthia Roman lives, the search for a summer job has taken on a depressing air of futility.
For weeks, Ms.
Roman has been applying for jobs at retail outlets around the city, but no one calls with an offer.
"If I don't find one, I'll just hang around the projects -- broke, hot and thirsty," she said.

METRO DIGEST
TREATING DRUG ADDICTION IN PRISONS
With more than one million Americans behind bars and up to 80 percent of them involved with powerful drugs like cocaine and heroin, rehabilitation programs, at their best, offer a potent weapon for decreasing addiction, crime and the spiraling costs of incarceration.
Yet only about one in six inmates receives any kind of treatment, and much of it amounts to "just say no" admonishments.
A result is that prisons perpetuate a kind of pinwheel of failure among drug users, who return to the streets unchanged and end up back in prison, sometimes within weeks.  [ Page 1. ] NEW YORK CITY  FEWER CONDOMS IN GIVEAWAY
The All Saints Lutheran Parish in the South Bronx gave away 1,500 condoms last year during its annual basketball tournament.
This year, it was able to give out only about 300 -- the result of a dispute with the city, which does not want them given away in parks at all.
The city argues that condoms should not be distributed freely where young children are so prevalent, while the church says a park is the perfect place to reach the youths who most need to learn about preventing AIDS.  [ 25. ] WHERE A FAILING GRADE IS NEGOTIABLE
Principals and teachers in New York City say that the pressure to reassess the grades of failing students surfaces in subtle ways.
They describe the case of Robert Durkin, the principal of Washington Irving High School in Manhattan, as extreme.
He was removed for giving 17 failing seniors extra homework and permitting them to graduate.
He bypassed the authority of teachers, who reported him to the Board of Education.
The conflict ripples more gently through the rest of the school system, with teachers describing pressure from principals and principals saying they sometimes change a grade, based on a student's appeal.  [ 25. ] A MAN'S CLOSET YIELDS AN ARSENAL

New Jersey Daily Briefing; State Workers' Union Negotiates
Negotiations between Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman's administration and the union that represents 35,000 of the state's public employees are scheduled to resume today after a breather yesterday.
The principal sticking point is the administration's plan to make state workers contribute to health insurance premiums, The Associated Press reported.
Contracts for both the Communications Workers of America and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Employees expired at 12:01 A.M. on Saturday.
The two unions have voted to authorize strikes.
The International Federation, which represents 7,000 employees in state government and colleges, met yesterday with state officials.


Where the Rent-Stabilized Rental Units Are.
More than a million rental units in the city are regulated by either rent-control or rent-stabilization programs.
Rent control applies to about 100,000 pre-war apartments.
Tenants have no leases, and rent increases are limited to 7.5 percent a year.
When a tenant moves or dies, a landlord may raise the rent to nearly the market value, and the aprtment becomes rent stabilized.
Rent stabilization applies to about 900,000 post-war units.
A state board ties rent increases roughly to inflation and to the landlord's maintenance costs.
Last week the Rent Guidelines Board approved increases of 2 percent for one-year leases and 4 percent for four-year leases for all of the city's 900,000 rent-stabilized apartments.


S.E.C. Said to Investigate Investment Firm
Regulators from the Securities and Exchange Commission are to visit the York, Pa., office of First Capital Strategists Inc. today to investigate the firm's loss of $128 million of college endowments, according to people familiar with the situation.
The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the firm's actions in the accounts of the Common Fund violated anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.


Sports of The Times; New Coach, Old Blood, Same Story?
DON NELSON'S courtship with the Knicks reminds me of my decision to move to New York several years ago.
Aside from the professional advantages and cultural stimulation of living here, I thought a change of scenery might also put some life in what, as it happened, was a terminally ill marriage.
When I explained the last rationale to a friend who had lived here for a while, he said, expressing sorrow and humor, "This is not the place you move to salvage your marriage."


Margeotes Fertitta Gets a New Name
Margeotes Fertitta Donaher &amp; Weiss in New York said that it was changing its name, effective immediately, to Margeotes/Fertitta &amp; Partners.
The change is being made to coincide with the resignation of Paul Donaher, a partner and strategic planning director, in addition to several other organizational changes at the agency.
"I'm looking at this as an adventure," Mr.
Donaher, 39, said on Friday, adding that he was leaving the agency after 12 years to look "at a bunch of options." He said that he was planning to stay in marketing, outside the agency world or within.
Mr.
Donaher's responsibilities would be reassigned among several employees, after his departure, which is effective Sept. 1.


Mets Still In Search Of One Clutch Play
If it's not a bad pitch, it's a mental lapse.
Or it's a clutch hit that doesn't come.
As has been the case for much of 1995 for the Mets, it was all of the above yesterday.
"We're playing up to the hilt and we just don't crack it," Manager Dallas Green said.
"We need a hit here, a pitch here, a defensive play, and we're just not getting it. And that's a telltale sign that you're going to lose."


Islanders and Milbury Wait for Wednesday
The Islanders are expected to hold a news conference Wednesday morning to name MIKE MILBURY, the former Boston Bruins coach, as their new head coach.
"It's fair to say that there are serious discussions taking place with Mike Milbury, his agent and DON MALONEY," the Islanders' co-chairman and chief executive officer, ROBERT ROSENTHAL, said from his Long Island home last night, referring to the team's general manager.
Milbury said his agent, MARK PERRONE, and Maloney met briefly yesterday and had set up another meeting for today.
Milbury is expected to sign a four-year contract for just under $3 million, which would make him one of the highest-paid coaches in the National Hockey League.
Milbury reportedly has been asking for a five-year deal, however, and that might be what has been holding up the negotiations.


CHRONICLE
It may have been a royal wedding, but the event was certainly nontraditional.
When PRINCESS STEPHANIE of Monaco arrived for her wedding to her former bodyguard, DANIEL DUCRUET, she was clutching in her arms the couple's second child, 13-month-old PAULINE.
The ceremony in Monte Carlo on Saturday was closed to all but immediate family, the Reuters news agency reported.
A crowd waited in the tiny streets next to the Royal Palace, but onlookers got no more than a fleeting glimpse of the bride in her lace dress.


Credit 'Special Partners' With a Deserving Assist
When Scott Brown fired a pass to his Team Connecticut teammate Kester Hernandez on the field at the vast Yale sports complex today, it was more than a routine soccer maneuver.
For Hernandez, 14, who is from Waterbury, Conn., is mentally retarded, while Brown, a 30-year-old banker from Farmington, is not.
A little earlier on an adjacent field, 19-year-old Joey Swanson of Team Colorado deftly handled a cross-field pass from 39-year-old Tom Faber, who usually plays in soccer's "mainstream" because he is not retarded.


Behind Smiles, Egyptians Tell Mubarak to Shape Up
In the sweltering heat of Cairo, Egypt's President, Hosni Mubarak, is going through his hottest political summer since he stepped in to fill the void when Anwar el-Sadat was assassinated 14 years ago.

Bombing Bosnia Will Solve Nothing
To the Editor:
Re "Bombs, Not Words, in Bosnia" by Warren Zimmerman (Op-Ed, June 23): None of the errors of analysis and comprehension that have contributed to the debacle in the former Yugoslavia have been more detrimental to development of a sound policy than the belief that only American bombing of Serbs will lead to an acceptable outcome.


Offerings Stolen During Mass
Parishioners had just begun to take communion at St.

The police said the Rev.
Henry F. Schabowski and a few other parishioners recognized Mr.
Baczynski, a former St.

World News Briefs; U.N. and Angola Agree On Resettlement Plan
The United Nations and the Government of Angola have agreed on a plan to return more than 300,000 Angolan refugees who fled during the country's long civil war and to rebuild communities for them, the High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, said today.
Mrs.
Ogata and President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola agreed on the $44 million project last week in a meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
It was based on a refugee resettlement model first used in Cambodia in 1993 and expanded in Mozambique, where the refugee agency has helped 1.7 million people to return home.

Opel Employee Inquiry
The office of the district attorney in Darmstadt, Germany, said yesterday that it was investigating employees and associates of Adam Opel A.G., the German subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, on suspicion of improper awarding of contracts.
Opel and the district attorney said the police had searched company premises and the office and company car of a board member, Peter Enderle, on Friday.
Opel said it had initiated the investigation itself in September.


VIOLENCE ERUPTS IN ULSTER CITIES
Violent street protests returned to Roman Catholic areas of Belfast and Londonderry today for the first time in 10 months after the authorities released a British soldier who had been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a teen-aged Catholic girl here in 1990.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary, or police, said tonight that there had been 120 incidents of violence, mostly in Catholic areas of west and north Belfast.
Dozens of cars and trucks were intercepted by masked men, who forced their drivers out, then burned or otherwise vandalized the vehicles.
There were no injuries reported, and no arrests as the police apparently decided to watch the action rather than confront it and risk aggravating the violence.
Tonight, burning cars lit up the Falls Road in West Belfast, and were seen in flames in many other main streets.


MILITARY OFFICIALS SEEK WAY TO SAVE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA
Pentagon officials have crafted a plan with members of the independent commission on the closing of military bases that they hope will save thousands of jobs at a California Air Force base and political face for President Clinton.

MODEL TEXAS DRUG PLAN, TRIPPED AT POLLS
Four years ago, the Texas Legislature approved what was to be the largest, most aggressive drug treatment program of any prison system in the world.
But when the state changed governors, Texas's vanguard program went into a stall.
And with it went the state's bid to be the model that would transform the nation's attitude toward drug-addicted criminals.
Many experts believe that intensive treatment is the most effective way to prevent inmates from returning to prison.
The experience of Texas shows how difficult it is to keep this thought alive on a local level, much less move it onto a national stage.  [ Page 1. ]

To the people who live and work in the hamlets around its slopes, Snake Mountain has for decades been little more than a wooded, double-humped bulge in the bucolic checkerboard of farms and forest east of Albany.

Jersey Turnpike Strike May Spread to Parkway
A strike by toll collectors threw operations on the New Jersey Turnpike into confusion today, forcing officials to allow tens of thousands of motorists to ride free for about eight hours, until supervisors, part-time workers and people hired on the spot replaced them for part of the afternoon and evening.
Some members of the union attempted to return to their jobs late tonight in compliance with a superior court judge's order to end the walkout.
But they were turned away by New Jersey Turnpike Authority officials, although the agency was unable to muster enough replacement workers and had to leave the tollbooths empty again overnight.

Workers represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, who work chiefly in state-run hospitals and institutions, will pay contributions for medical benefits if they do not elect to join free managed-health-care plans offered by the state, the Governor said.


At Belmont, a Trainer Turns a Double Play
Belmont Park will fire the final salvo in its four-day holiday weekend today when the Suburban Handicap is run for the 109th time.
But the trainer Allen Jerkens, who won the race the last two years with Devil His Due, did some early stirring yesterday when he entered horses in two smaller stakes with widely differing conditions, and won them both.
Jerkens has won as many as three stakes in a day, and is renowned for upsetting Kelso three times and Secretariat twice.
But, in its own small way, there was nothing shabby about what he accomplished in consecutive races yesterday.


Hamlets Are Fearing Worst If Mountain Is to Be Mined
To the people who live and work in the hamlets around its slopes, Snake Mountain has for decades been little more than a wooded, double-humped bulge in the bucolic checkerboard of farms and forest east of Albany.
To the Lane Construction Company, which has owned Snake Mountain for 50 years, it is a valuable hunk of Rensselaer graywacke and Metawee argillite, just the right kind of rock for blending with asphalt or cement.


Yugoslavs Celebrate Sports Victory With a Political Echo
Celebrating not just a sports triumph but what they hope is the beginning of their emergence from more than three years of international isolation, thousands of jubilant Serbs poured into the streets Sunday night and this morning after the Yugoslav national team won the European basketball championship.
Even larger crowds turned out this afternoon to welcome the victorious players home from the Athens tournament.


This Summer, Off Time in July Seems as Likely as Ice in July for the N.H.L.
Traditionally, the month of July used to be a blank page in the hockey calendar, a 31-day break for fishing and boating in Canada.
This summer, partly because of the lockout that delayed the season, July is busy, beginning with the awards ceremony on Thursday in Toronto and continuing with the entry draft on Saturday in Edmonton.


Bear Kills Woman and Her Son in Alaska
A bear, possibly a grizzly, attacked and killed a 77-year-old woman and her 45-year-old son on Saturday as they hiked on a popular park trail 20 miles south of downtown Anchorage and within earshot of a major highway, officials said today.
The State Medical Examiner, Michael Propst, said in a statement after autopsies were performed that the victims, Marcie Trent and Larry Waldron, had suffered wounds consistent with a bear attack.
A state trooper, Lee Oly, who was a member of the search party that found the bodies, said Mrs.
Trent had suffered massive injuries to her head and chest, while Mr.
Waldron had apparently bled to death from a severed artery in his leg.


Algeria's Morceli Sets Another World Record
There have been two great North African runners in the last decade.
Said Aouita of Morocco was the first.
Nourredine Morceli of Algeria is the second.
Tonight in the Paris Grand Prix meet at Stade Charlety, Morceli made the changing of the guard complete by taking away the last world record that Aouita still had on the books: the 2,000 meters.


Russian Tycoon Finds Politics Good Business
Standing in front of his office window overlooking the Kremlin, Oleg Boiko was contemplating whether he should acquire a new license plate for his limousine.
At 30, Mr.
Boiko, one of Russia's richest businessmen, had in mind a special plate with a tricolor flag indicating that the driver is a high-level Government official immune fromordinary traffic regulations.
Only 500 such plates are supposed to be issued for all of Russia.


Let Mothers and Newborns Recover in the Comfort of Home; Time for Genetic Tests
To the Editor:
Your report on New Jersey's law requiring insurers to pay for a second day of hospital care for mothers and their newborns did not point out one of the chief casualties of the trend toward "drive-through deliveries" -- the ability to screen newborns for serious, but treatable, genetic disorders.


Fuller-O'Brien Is Sold
Imperial Chemical Industries of Britain said yesterday that it had purchased Fuller-O'Brien Paints, a unit of the privately held O'Brien Corporation.
I.C.I. did not disclose the purchase price but said the value was less than 1 percent of I.C.I.'s net assets.
It reported assets of $:3.7 billion ($5.92 billion) last year, indicating a transaction value of $:37 million or less.
Fuller-O'Brien Paints, based in South San Francisco, Calif., reported sales last year of about $80 million.

Strike Leads to Turnpike Chaos
A toll collectors' strike threw operations on the New Jersey Turnpike into chaos yesterday, forcing officials to allow motorists to ride free for eight hours, until supervisors, part-time workers and people hired on the spot replaced the collectors for part of the afternoon and evening.
But officials were unable to muster enough replacment workers and had to leave the tollbooths empty again overnight.


With Marilyn Monroe, Alone on Virtual Beach
THIS is not a real beach.
If this were a real beach, we would need a very large umbrella to make enough shade to let us hope to squint at the dim screen of our laptop computer.
This is a virtual beach, where heat and humidity conspire against productivity, and brains, like computers, are most often in slumber mode.
Here at Virtual Beach, the Sloth Police have banned all useful programs in the interest of assuring absolute nonproductivity.
The only acceptable software here is the digital equivalent of "beach books," mindless, trashy and irrelevant.
Much of the World Wide Web would fill the bill, but it has been posted as off limits on the ground that surfing there would court the slight but growing danger of colliding with something useful.


Reflecting On the 4th, Many Draw A Blank
On the upper deck of the ferry headed to Liberty Island yesterday, Niki Woo said she was excited to be in New York for the Fourth of July fireworks.
But she was still confused about one thing.
"I don't even know what July Fourth is," said Niki, 17, a high school senior at Castle High School on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.
Her friend Erin Chang, 17, tried to help.
"We were freed from the Mother Country, from the British, weren't we?" Erin said.
"Wasn't it the end of the war?"

Colleges Are Told Full Recovery of Losses Is Unlikely
The Common Fund, which invests a $20 billion pool of university endowments, told its investors yesterday that there was little hope of recovering all the $128 million that the fund lost because of unauthorized trading by First Capital Strategists, its investment adviser.
"It appears highly unlikely that there is any significant possibility of recovering the full loss," David K. Storrs, president of the fund, said in a conference call with schools that have invested in it.
Addressing the issue of whether First Capital could make good the loss, Mr.
Storrs added, "We do not believe First Capital has substantial assets."


University Comes Down Hard on Bias, Setting Off a Debate Across Canada
Taking extraordinary action to counter charges of sexism and racism in the classroom, the University of British Columbia has halted admissions to its graduate political science program until it can improve the department's social climate.
The action has touched off a rousing debate in Canada about harassment and academic freedom.
It was applauded by women and minority groups but seen by some others as defaming an entire department and chilling academic discourse.


Chechen Offers to Resign if Russia Grants Independence
Adding his own defiant twist to fragile peace talks, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, the rebel president of Chechnya who remains in hiding, has told a top Russian negotiator that he would step down, but only if Russia recognized the region's independence.
A senior member of the Russian delegation to peace talks in Grozny, the Chechen capital, went to a secret location in rebel-held territory on Sunday to hear Mr.
Dudayev's position.


Mayor Assails Critics Of Labor Agreement
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani lashed back at critics of his new labor agreement with municipal unions, denouncing suggestions from fiscal monitors that he should have extracted more concessions as "crazy" and "off the wall." City workers have made enough sacrifices, he said, and those who suggest otherwise have a "political agenda."

Archbishop Paul Nguyen Van Binh, who led the Archdiocese of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, for 35 years, died on Saturday.
He was 84.
Official Vietnamese newspapers, according to The Associated Press, did not say where he died.
His health had been poor for some years, but he remained the spiritual leader of Vietnam's largest Catholic community.


Networks Offer Wimbledon, Doubled
Yes, it was absolutely fabulous that NBC and HBO carried Wimbledon simultaneously from noon to 3 P.M. yesterday, but flipping between them could get you unstuck in time, endeavoring to discover what's live, almost live or taped.
To their credit, the networks chose not to compete when both were on.
So NBC was on tape at noon with the Pete Sampras-Greg Rusedski match while HBO focused on live coverage of Goran Ivanisevic playing Todd Martin.

Credit National Starts Corporate Finance Move
Credit National S.A. of France formally began its bid of 1.24 billion francs ($257 million) for Investissement, Finance et Developpement S.A. as the first step toward redeploying its business toward fee-earning corporate finance.
Credit National developed the strategy after its profit slumped to 67 million francs in 1994 from 330 million in 1993.

Let Mothers and Newborns Recover in the Comfort of Home
To the Editor:
Pregnancy is not a disease, although it has become "medicalized" into an entity using fetal monitoring, anesthesia, hospitalization and operative interventions, few of which have been proved necessary in normal pregnancies.
Now we have a law requiring insurers to cover a minimum 48-hour hospitalization, on request, for a normal delivery in New Jersey (news article, June 29).


Al Jarreau, Happy and Ready to Prove It
Vocal improvisers like the jazz singer Al Jarreau and the female Belgian-African quintet Zap Mama, who appeared together at Carnegie Hall on Thursday and Friday nights, are a reminder that the human voice has always been the most versatile musical instrument.
The range of sounds that the mouth, throat, tongue and voice box can produce by themselves puts the synthesizer to shame.
And when you bring in hands, knees, chest and elbows and then add microphones, the sonic possibilities multiply exponentially.
The endless possibilities can also lead to rampant self-indulgence, as genuine musical invention is confused with cute, crowd-pleasing sound effects.
At their most annoying, vocal conjurers behave like grown-up babies wallowing in their own spontaneous grunts and gurgles.


Worker Shot in Robbery
A gunman shot an employee of a Bronx check-cashing store during a robbery yesterday just after after the woman arrived at work to open for business, the police said.
The employee, Evelyn de la Hose-White, was shot as the gunman was forcing her and another female employee to open a safe behind the counter at Action Check Cashing, 4729 White Plains Road in Wakefield, the police said.


Plan Could Again Delay the Electric Car
After years of arguments between state officials and the auto companies about whether electric cars are ready for the mass market, the Governor of Massachusetts, a state that has been pushing for the new cars, has offered Detroit a compromise: the state will delay requiring car makers to build electric cars until two years after any manufacturer, anywhere in the world, builds one that meets a set of criteria on performance and price.
If the proposal is accepted, it could significantly delay the introduction of electric cars.
Even advocates of electric cars now believe that some kind of delay or other weakening of the standards seems likely in all the states that plan to require them -- New York, California and Massachusetts.


Defense Lawyer Pleads Guilty to Aiding Cartel
A former prosecutor-turned-defense-lawyer pleaded guilty in Miami yesterday to aiding Colombian cocaine traffickers in a case that raises questions about how much an attorney can do for a client without becoming a criminal himself.
Donald L. Ferguson, who was an assistant United States attorney in Miami in the mid-1970's, pleaded guilty to reduced charges of conspiring to obstruct justice and money laundering and agreed to testify against two other lawyers who also defended drug traffickers.


McDowell Hangs On Against His Old Team
The largest crowd of the season at Comiskey Park came to see Jack McDowell and the fireworks show today.
They came to boo McDowell, who used to be one of their own White Sox, and cheer the special effects in the sky.
At least the fireworks did not disappoint them.
McDowell did.
Pitching the sort of gritty game that helped establish his reputation in Chicago as a pitcher who simply won while not worrying about how picturesque his performances were, McDowell did not crumble when the White Sox blistered him for three runs in the first inning.
He kept throwing hard, stopped his former teammates on four hits for the next eight innings and enjoyed his homecoming as the Yankees won, 8-4, before 36,346 fans.


University to Display Tobacco Documents
The University of California at San Francisco has said it will make available hundreds of documents showing that the tobacco industry concealed its knowledge of the addictive nature of nicotine and other harmful effects of smoking.
The university said on Friday that it would display the documents in its library and publish them over the Internet.
The announcement followed a ruling late Thursday by the California Supreme Court rejecting a request by the Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Company to block publication of the documents.


Court Face-Off Postponed
The courtroom face-off that was scheduled yesterday between the Devils and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority was postponed until July 11 as both sides continued talks to keep the Stanley Cup champions in New Jersey.
The authority was scheduled to press its case in Superior Court for a temporary restraining order to keep the team from following through on its threat to terminate its lease at Byrne Meadowlands Arena on Thursday.


Rounding Up a U.S. Winner For a Croatia Beauty Contest
Although war in the former Yugoslavia rages over the horizon, a young woman from New Hyde Park, L.I., is traveling to a beauty contest in Croatia this summer.
"The war is horrifying, and I feel complete sadness about it," said 18-year-old Natalie Verbanac, who will compete for the title of Miss Istria on July 23.
"But it's good for people if they can still see life going on."
Istria, a peninsula tucked away in the northwest corner of Croatia, is known for its turquoise blue waters and aversion to nationalist politics.
Nearer to Trieste than to Zagreb, the peninsula has so far been spared any fighting in the current war, and daily life -- with its beauty pageant and other traditions -- still proceeds with a measure of peace.

On Fire Island, Sometimes the Share Goes Out of Sharing
KENNY FUNK'S last three summers passed in a whir of beach days and kamikaze nights.
There were Grateful Dead marathons and parties with 200 happy-houred guests stuffed onto decks made for 20.
"The best times," he said.
He blames himself for this year.
Instead of renting space in a beach share as usual, he and two friends decided to run a share house.
This is like going from happy camper to camp counselor, or Eagle Scout to den mother.
It's sobering, anyway.
"The most overwhelming experience of my life," Mr.
Funk said.

Chess; Kasparov captures the second part of the Intel Grand Prix, but not easily.
Gary Kasparov of Russia won the second installment of the 25-minutes-per-game Intel World Chess Grand Prix at the Tribeca Performing Arts Center, June 20-23.
But it did not come easy for the Professional Chess Association's world champion.
He handily defeated his chief rival, the Ukrainian grandmaster Vasily Ivanchuk, 2-0, in the two-game knockout final, but he had trouble getting there.
He drew twice with the grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, in the semifinal round, then qualified for the final in their five-minute playoff game.
Moreover, he had earlier met stubborn resistance from the California grandmaster Nick Defirmian, who had drawing chances before he incorrectly sacrificed a pawn in the endgame.


Walter Lineberger, 82, Banker And Ex-Defense Dept. Official

The cause was complications from pneumonia, his family said.


With a Voice Euphoric And Strong
Halfway through her set on Saturday night at Carnegie Hall, Celia Cruz performed a song, "Yerbero Moderno," from her days in the 1950's as the singer for the Cuban band Sonora Matancera.
The song has the singer advertising her wares; she's an herbalist.
Ms.
Cruz took the piece at a medium tempo, and proceeded to nudge the melody into new meaning, using just a few notes.
Her improvisations were based on a percussive sense of rhythm.
And she infused the piece with a glorious generosity -- the improvisation seemed less for her benefit than for the audience to savor -- that made the music transcendent.
It wasn't the only moment reaching that level of beauty; Ms.
Cruz knows her way around the transcendent.
She might just be the last of the great pop singers who sound as if they had learned to sing without a microphone.
And as she improvised, her voice, magnificent in its heft and intensity, ripped through the backdrop provided by her band.
Ms.
Cruz shouted and called; her voice sounded as if it were made of cast iron, durable and pure.
And she is close enough to the ecstatic religious music of Afro-Cuban Santeria to bring to all her performances the deep euphoria that most religious-based music uses, regardless of the outer manifestations in the pop world.

In a Change of Policy, and Heart, Colleges Join Fight Against Inflated Grades
A year after Stanford University and Dartmouth College announced changes in their grading policies designed to stem a 30-year trend of grade inflation, a number of other elite colleges say they are considering making high grades the exception rather than the rule.
At Dartmouth, where the average grade increased last year to a B-plus from a B in 1973, transcripts now include not only grades, but also their context -- the class size and class average.

If 36 people board boat (a) at point (b) for a cruise in harbor (c), what is going on?
JUDITH ENGEL, a mathematics teacher at the Bronx High School of Science, refrained from asking brain-teasers like that one yesterday.
But she did take 36 friends and former students on a cruise around New York Harbor.
They boarded the Amberjack V -- which Ms.

In Income-Strapped Washington, Traffic Squads Are a Godsend
Her first target was a white Chevrolet Camaro from Pennsylvania, parked just off the corner at 11th and H Streets, a busy downtown intersection.
The parking meter had expired.
In less than 30 seconds, Jennifer Moorer issued a summons that carried a $15 fine.
Over the next two hours last Wednesday, what Ms.
Moorer described as a typical midweek morning for traffic and illegally parked vehicles, she wrote 34 more tickets, worth a total of $1,160 to the District of Columbia.
And her shift had six hours to go.


Benjamin S. Kalnick; Lawyer and Accountant, 84
Benjamin S. Kalnick, a New York lawyer and accountant who served as Mayor of Kings Point, L.I., died on June 24 at New York University Medical Center.
He was 84 and lived in retirement in Palm Beach, Fla.
Mr.
Kalnick was a former national vice president of the American Jewish Congress and a founder and chairman of the American Association for Jewish Education.
He was Mayor and trustee of the Village of Kings Point, his former hometown, for more than 20 years.


Parks in Peril
This is the time of year when Americans begin flocking to their national parks.
Some will find what they were looking for: vistas of spectacular beauty, hours of restorative silence.
But others may find themselves wondering whether they have traded one rat race for another.
The national parks contain most of America's greatest scenic wonders.
They also suffer from the urban nuisances vacationers had hoped to leave behind: traffic jams, noise, dirty air and garbage.
There is, as Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico notes, "trouble in paradise." If past experience is any guide, for example, there will be gridlock today in Yosemite.
By one estimate, the Grand Canyon alone needs $350 million to repair roads, sewers and water systems.
Many of the park system's 22,000 historic buildings, as any visitor to Ellis Island can confirm, are simply falling apart.


Tories Vote Today on the Future Of Both Major and the Party Itself

Six stars in women's bridge scored a victory in the International Team Trials here this afternoon, with a trip to Beijing for world championship play in October as their reward.
The team, Kitty Munson, Judi Radin and Sue Picus, all of Manhattan; Rozanne Pollack of Warren, N.J.; Carol Simon of Summit, N.J., and Karen McCallum of Exeter, N.H., won the final playoff match by 16 imps.
Their opponents were Judge Amalya Kearse and Jacqui Mitchell, both of Manhattan; Tobi Deutsch Sokolov and Mildred Breed, both of Austin, Tex.; Joyce Lilie of Las Vegas, Nev., and Jo Morse of Tucson, Ariz.


David H. Sawyer Dies at 59; Innovator in Political Strategy
David H. Sawyer, a pioneer in the field of political consulting that burgeoned in the 1970's and 1980's as party machines lost their clout in choosing electoral candidates, died on Sunday in New York Hospital.
He was 59 and lived in Manhattan.
He had been under treatment for several weeks for a brain tumor, his family said.


Marching to a Differentiating Drum; A Bronx Bugle Corps Samples a World Outside the Inner City
As they rehearsed far beneath the amber lights of the Triborough Bridge, Morriah Christian, 17, and her sweat-soaked friends stopped marching briefly Friday night to watch the holiday world whir by above them -- vacationers in cars and vans and Land Rovers headed off to Connecticut or Long Island.
But there was little time for summer reveries for Morriah or Kamari Daniels or Dorena Ruiz, among the 55 determined teen-aged members of the Kips Bay Knight Club, a traveling drum and bugle corps from the Bronx.
What a weekend of marching: Saturday, Levittown, Pa.; Sunday, Clifton, N.J., and this morning, July 4, parades in Needham and Stoughton, Mass.


In Tropical Forests, Arboreal Mating Is a Long-Distance Affair
IN the world's highly diverse tropical jungles, where 300 tree species can be packed into a few acres, a particular tree can easily find itself far from another member of its species.
Biologists, long puzzled by where such trees find mates in this flowering profusion, have at last begun to get some answers.
As biologists piece together the evidence, they are finding that these giants are not so isolated after all.
In fact, they send their pollen far and wide, pairing up with distant trees all over the forest.
Researchers are also finding that in some species, when the number of flowering trees in an area is reduced, as through selective logging, this long-distance mating can be disrupted.
Trees instead use more of their own pollen and the result is a greater proportion of self-fertilized seeds, producing inbred offspring that are often not as hearty as their outbred counterparts, which are more genetically diverse.

George Foreman's abdication has shaken the world of boxing.

Shell Game: Picking State Favorites
For more than a decade, State Senator James S. Cafiero pulled strings and twisted arms, trying in vain to get a certain bill passed.
This spring, he finally tasted victory: New Jersey designated the knobbed whelk -- also known as the conch, or scungilli -- the official state shell.
It wasn't easy.
One year, Mr.
Cafiero handed out a shell and a can of scungilli to each senator.
"When I stood up to move the bill," Mr.
Cafiero recalled, "I said, 'If you put this shell to your ear, it's specially programmed so you hear: Vote for this bill. Vote for this bill.' "


Van Morrison, No Frills, Leaves 'em Wanting More
"I don't fade away," the enigmatic Irish songwriter Van Morrison sang in a new song on Saturday night here at Jones Beach, adding after a short pause, "unless I choose." He and his nine-member band followed that principle throughout the 140-minute concert, which never waned but built to a soulful climax with a long, lustrous version of James Brown's "It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World." But then Mr.
Morrison decided to fade away: instead of performing a second encore, as his set list called for, he left the audience on its feet cheering for nearly 10 minutes before the house lights went on.
The crowd left a song or two short.
Dressed in a black-and-white suit and sunglasses, Mr.
Morrison belted out 22 songs and medleys with his usual showmanship: none.
He moved little except to waddle in place like a penguin, and his stage patter consisted solely of incoherent mumbles as he announced the title of each song before performing it.
Mr.
Morrison's other idiosyncrasies were apparent in small bursts.
These ranged from a fit of off-rhythm scat singing in "Perfect Fit," from his new album, "Days Like This" (Polydor), to letting his over-emoting backup vocalist Brian Kennedy sing (and murder) the first half of "Tupelo Honey."


All Types Of Music Turned Solidly Into Jazz
No matter how fervently some jazz aficionados may believe that the music has evolved into an ivory tower form whose vitality no longer depends on close interaction with other nonclassical styles, it is just not so.
As evidence, one need look no further than to the artistry of Cassandra Wilson.
This 36-year-old singer who appeared at the Summerstage concert series in Central Park on Sunday afternoon is regarded by many as the most important American jazz vocalist to emerge in the last decade.
As Sunday's concert showed, a major reason for that acclaim has to do with the way she brings other genres into her music and transforms them from the ground up into something strikingly original but securely jazz-oriented.


CHRONICLE
BEVERLY SILLS is going back on stage -- but this time to talk, not to sing.
She will narrate the concert version of Johann Strauss's operetta "The Gypsy Baron" during the New York Philharmonic's "Mostly Vienna" series on July 13, 14 and 15.
The operetta's cast -- which will sing in German, while Miss Sills delivers her narration in English -- will be the soprano Julia Migenes, the mezzo-soprano Rosalind Elias, the tenor Stanford Olsen and the bass-baritone Jan Opalach.
Miss Sills maintains that her stint as a narrator is a one-time thing.
"I thought it would be fun to put on a pretty dress and some makeup again," she said.
"I am not getting paid for this. Just because my price is right doesn't mean that I'm going to be available for every engagement that comes along."


R. W. Redington; Physicist, 70, Was Leader in Imaging

He was 70 and lived in Niskayuna, outside Schenectady.
The cause was a heart attack, according to a spokesman for General Electric's Research and Development Center in Schenectady.

"But together we can do almost everything, even fly to Mars."


New Clue to Heart Disease: A Vitamin Lack
COULD a vitamin deficiency be a leading cause of heart disease?
The hypothesis, first put forward nearly three decades ago, sounded flaky to most heart disease experts, and was largely ignored.
But it has recently gained a surprising new credence and is now the subject of the first international meeting devoted to the issue, to be held in Ireland this week.
The vitamin in question is folic acid, a B vitamin.
One of its several functions in the body is to reduce the amounts in the blood of an amino acid called homocysteine.
Researchers say that in recent years they have seen mounting evidence that large numbers of people have especially high levels of the amino acid homocysteine in their bloodstream, and that homocysteine can injure blood vessels, causing atherosclerosis and leading to heart attacks and strokes.
Folic acid, it seems, can reduce such damage by reducing blood levels of homocysteine to a safe range.

Car Crash Leaves 4 Dead
Four women were killed before dawn yesterday when a car being driven the wrong way on the Garden State Parkway collided head-on with the van in which they were riding, causing it to explode, the state police said.
A passerby, Kurt Osuch of Linden, was able to pull a Paterson couple, Matthew B. and Johnnie Ruth Buie, from the burning van.
Mrs.
Buie underwent surgery but remained in critical condition.
Her husband, the driver of the van, escaped serious injury.


U.S. Trade Pullback
President Clinton's credentials as a free-trader seemed substantial.
But now he is in danger of tarnishing his record.
Mr.
Clinton enthusiastically supported the world trade liberalization talks that concluded last year under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the creation of its successor, the World Trade Organization.


In a Polish Shipyard, Signals Of Eastern Europe's Revival
With the zeal of a supersalesman, Andrzej Zarnoch walks the blustery piers astride the Baltic Sea, showing off his shipyard's latest prize, a 440-foot bulk carrier destined for Norway.
Mr.
Zarnoch, the marketing director of the yard, has reason to feel buoyant.
Gleaming vessels like the Fossnes Bergen are moving out of the berths here at record speed.
Production time has been cut by half in two years, the order books are filled with contracts from the West, and the Szczecin shipyard, once Poland's poor sister to the fabled Gdansk, is now ranked among the world's top dozen.


Review/Fashion; In Italy, Bad Taste With a Satiric Edge
As subjective a concept as it is, there are a few items the fashion world seems to have agreed are in bad taste for men.
Hot pants, for example.
Hip huggers.
Handbags.
White disco suits.
Printed polyester shirts.
Pointy patent leather shoes (especially in white).
So what were those very tasteless gigolo clothes doing all over the spring 1996 runways of Milan -- home to Giorgio Armani's temple of taste -- along with suits worn shirtless, shoes worn sockless and sandals worn with white socks?

A Change in Governors Stalls Model Drug Program in Texas
Four years ago, the Texas Legislature approved what was to be the largest, most aggressive drug treatment program of any prison system in the world.
The issue of treating addicts in prisons had no genuine champion anywhere in the nation until Ann W. Richards, the state's new Governor and a recovering alcoholic, made it her cause.
At the time, there was much fervid rhetoric about a revolutionary change in Texas's attitude toward criminals.
State Senator Ted B. Lyon, a Democrat and a prime sponsor of the bill, proclaimed: "If we can break the cycle of addiction, we can break the cycle of crime." Governor Richards, who visited prison therapy sessions and afterward sent inmates handwritten notes, felt strongly that Texas could someday show the nation how to use the prisons to break the cycle of drug use.


Fixing America, Step by Step, No Grays Allowed
TO RENEW AMERICA
By Newt Gingrich
260 pages. HarperCollins. $24.
Several Newt Gingriches are on display in his new book, "To Renew America." There's the Speaker of the House, trying hard to sound statesmanlike as he articulates his vision of America.
There's the Republican "bomb thrower," as he was often called during his days as the House minority whip, slipping in mean little asides about Democrats and liberals.
And there's the "happy 4-year-old who gets up every morning hoping to find a cookie that friends or relatives may have left for me somewhere."

Key Is Out for the Season, and Possibly Longer
The news that had seemed inevitable was finally announced today: Yankees pitcher Jimmy Key will undergo surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in his left shoulder Wednesday.
He will miss the rest of this season and might not pitch again.
Ever since the 34-year-old Key was unable to toss 10 pitches without pain in a workout last Monday and then couldn't even make it to the practice mound last Friday, it had become obvious that New York's best left-hander since Ron Guidry would be watching more baseball than he played this season.
Because it will be the second time in nine months that Key's shoulder has required surgery and because this surgery is more serious, there is reason to wonder if he will be able to return.


Deal Averts Hotel Strike In New York
Hotel workers in New York City reached a tentative agreement with hotel owners yesterday on a new six-year contract, averting a strike that had been threatened for midnight tonight.
Exact terms of the agreement were not disclosed, and they must be ratified by the 22,000-member New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council as well as the Hotel Association of New York, which represents 79 hotels.
Members of both groups were to be presented with the agreement and asked to vote on it tomorrow night.

Burning Flags and Barbaric Yawps
To most of us the Fourth of July is a time for patriotric revelry, outdoor barbecues and windy speeches.
It is a time to enjoy a few days off, to put aside intellectual challenges without feeling guilty.
Yet history reminds us that for those shrewd enough to grasp the potential uses of Independence Day, it once served as a platform for extraordinary polemical gestures -- a moment not to escape the nagging problems of society but to engage them.
On July 4, 1854, at an abolitionist rally in Framingham, Mass., William Lloyd Garrison burned a copy of the Constitution to demonstrate bitter disillusionment with a nation, supposedly founded on the ideals of justice and liberty, that had enslaved four million blacks.
The crowd of 3,000 let out a tremendous "Amen!"


Tap Rigor With Room for Personal Touches
Two New York premieres added a little extra pizazz to the Sunday matinee performance by the Jazz Tap Ensemble at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea).
"Swingin'," choreographed and performed by Lainie Manning, was a charmingly natty, sharp-edged response to a buoyant amble of a jazz score by Jerry Kalaf.
"New Trio," choreographed and performed by Derick Grant, Dormeshia Sumbry and Mark Mendonca to music by Hank Jones, sent its dancers through clusters of more gravity-bound footwork separated by moments of stillness and a skimming motif in which the three appeared to slide across the floor without touching it.
The Los Angeles-based group has managed to bridge the gulf between the traditional soloists that epitomized the art of tap in a revival in the 1970's in New York and the orchestral approach that is increasingly popular today, in which the dancers are seen as members of an orchestral or chamber-music tap ensemble.
The Jazz Tap dancers perform as a smoothly synchronized group without losing the distinctive presences and styles in numbers like "Jerry's Songs," choreographed and performed by Sam Weber, Lynn Dally and Mr.
Grant and Ms.
Sumbry, and "Tribute: Tap Dancin' at the Movies," choreographed and performed by Ms.
Manning, Mr.
Weber and Ms.
Sumbry.


Sports of The Times; 'Oh, By The Way, We Won'
ON the sunny soccer field outside Yale Bowl, the South African coaches were exhorting their players at halftime in four languages: Zulu, Sotho, Afrikaans and English.
But one word didn't need any translation.
"Shoot," one coach was saying. "Shoot."
Minutes later, 22-year-old Brian Mosi, known as Jomo, scored and flopped backward onto the grass in joy.
South Africa would defeat South Korea, 2-1, and now, in the small bleachers, Kate Rivers's cellular phone rang.
As the national director of South Africa Special Olympics, this middle-aged blonde in a flowered dress was discussing some details with another member of the delegation.


Slap Hitter Deflates Pulsipher And Mets
One big mistake.
Just enough to ruin an otherwise outstanding performance by Bill Pulsipher on a beautiful evening at Shea Stadium.
The 21-year-old rookie left-hander owned the Chicago Cubs last night.
Owned them, that is, until Rey Sanchez hit his first home run in nearly three years (and just his second in 1,171 major league at-bats), a two-run, opposite-field shot to right with two out in the eighth that propelled the Cubbies to a come-from-behind, 4-2 victory and left Pulsipher (1-3) muttering to himself.


Chemist Adds Missing Pieces To Theory on Life's Origins
NO one has yet shown how life originated on Earth, and the chance that science will ever unlock all the details of the process seems vanishingly small.
But as molecular biologists discover how nature may have built unaided the maze of tiny bridges that led from inanimate chemicals to living creatures, hopes brighten that the ancient pathway to life may one day be at least dimly revealed.
The latest news about the quest comes from Dr.
Stanley L. Miller of the University of California at San Diego, a pioneer in the reconstruction of "prebiotic" chemical reactions -- the primeval chemistry of the young Earth that is presumed to have given rise to life.
Dr.
Miller and a colleague, Dr.
Michael P. Robertson, report in a pair of papers that they have found a way that nature could have created several vital building blocks that had seemed beyond the reach of prebiotic chemistry.

Transform Your Image In Easy Stages
MORPHING is everywhere.
We see it on movie and television screens, and on the monitors of well-equipped computers operated by people willing to invest time, effort and expense in advanced equipment and complex programs.
When Apatosaurus (formerly Brontosaurus) transforms itself in stages into Tyrannosaurus rex (formerly a standup guy), that is morphing.
When a mild-looking man becomes a predatory terminator, that is morphing.
Morphing is suddenly easy.
Well, not exactly easy, but not that difficult either.
With Morphstudio, from Ulead Systems of Torrance, Calif., this totally inexperienced morphist made, in a few minutes, a one-second video sequence transforming the face of a pretty blondish woman into the face of a handsome blondish man.
In all honesty, I had meant to morph in the opposite direction, from handsome to pretty, but that is not the program's fault.


Dodgers Are a Hit in Any Language

The National League pennant may be about to hit the Los Angeles Dodgers in the hands, and the question is whether they will drop it.

Treasury Securities End Mixed In Light Day
Prices of Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday after several economic reports produced no surprises.
Trading was light in the shortened session.
While many traders were off yesterday ahead of the Fourth of July holiday, the session still had the potential to be volatile after the turmoil of last week.
On Thursday, Treasury prices fell sharply after the May new-home sales report showed expected strength in the economy.
The report raised fears that the Federal Reserve would not, as expected, reduce short-term interest rates when its policy-making committee meets tomorrow.
On Friday, Treasury prices seesawed on expectations, later confirmed, that the Chicago purchasing managers' survey would show weakness, which helped the case for a Fed rate cut.

Mr. Mubarak: Valuable and Vulnerable
Fortunately for the Middle East, Egypt's President, Hosni Mubarak, escaped assassination last week in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
Cairo alleges, without hard evidence, that Islamic-ruled Sudan was involved either through its Government or through the Islamic National Front, led by its most powerful politician, Hassan al-Turabi.
In response to the assassination attempt Mr.
Mubarak urged Sudan's people to overthrow their Government, and at midweek the two countries briefly skirmished over a disputed border area.
Without more data, outsiders cannot be sure about Sudan's involvement.
But whoever set up the ambush, it was a reminder that the Mubarak regime, a valuable contributor to the Mideast peace process, remains vulnerable to violent assault.


Congressional Memo; Republicans Linger Over Words, Delaying Real-Life Choices
Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, held a news conference last Thursday to discuss a Republican plan for Medicare.
It was a one-page list of six principles, beginning with "We must act immediately to preserve Medicare" and going on to commit to "choice," an unfettered doctor-patient relationship and an end to "waste, fraud and abuse."
But these six principles did not address the most burning real-life question about Medicare these days: just how the Republicans intend to extract $270 billion in savings from the program in seven years, which their budget resolution commits them to do.


'. . . And Called Him Macaroni'
"Yankee Doodle" is the unofficial anthem of the Fourth of July.
It was introduced to colonial America by British troops, mocking the roughneck Yankees, but the colonials soon appropriated it as their own.
Quite unintended by the composer, whoever that may have been, it captured the cocky spirit of a nation about to be born.
Little is certain about the origins of this delightful air.
Who wrote the words?
When?
Does the tune really date from the Middle Ages?
Is a macaroni an "it" or a "him"?


F.B.I. Reveals A Man's Plan To Blow Up A Courthouse
Federal agents say that they have uncovered a plot to use a fertilizer bomb to destroy the United States Courthouse here, but that the conspiracy appears to have no connection to the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
According to newly released court documents, the Federal Bureau of Investigation learned about the Spokane plot from an informer eight days after the April 19 Oklahoma City blast, which killed 167 people and injured more than 400.


Search Intensifies in the Unabom Case
A flurry of activity in the case of a notorious serial mail bomber -- a new package of his writings, word of a mysterious photograph of a possible suspect, visits by Federal agents to California scrap-metal dealers who might have sold him materiel -- has arisen in recent days as the search intensified for the self-described anarchist known as the Unabomber.
Scrap-metal dealers said F.B.I. agents showed them a grainy, black-and-white photo of a man, perhaps caught by a surveillance camera, who seemed heavier than the hooded figure in a well-known composite sketch made from the single known sighting of the bomber in 1987.
They said they were also questioned about sales of magnesium, a metal used in incendiary bombs.


Market Holiday Has Early Start

JIM B. MILLER has received 2,400 nominations for candidates for his third annual worst-boss-of-the-year contest.
Mr.

In the "worst" category, which draws about four times as many nominations as the "best" category, one boss thanked employees for a 92-percent increase in production not by handing out raises but by passing out moldy food and canned goods whose expiration dates had long passed.
Another ordered his assistant to dismiss anyone who called in sick.

Victors in Thailand, Linked to Vote-Buying, Seek Coalition
A party long tied to the most unsavory elements of politics in Thailand moved quickly yesterday to form a coalition Government after it won national elections last weekend, apparently sweeping Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai from power.

A New Passport Doesn't Help Rusedski at All on Center Court
He put on a happy face, but that turned out to be a most unwise strategy once his opponent made it his main order of business "to wipe the smile off" the face of giddy Greg Rusedski, the man who decided to forsake his native Canada on the premise that a British passport would guarantee him instant fame in his mother's homeland.
Rusedski's defection did make him a celebrity, but it didn't guarantee him smooth sledding at Wimbledon, where he and his 100-watt grin were summarily extinguished on Center Court today by the two-time defending Wimbledon champion, Pete Sampras.


Regent Buys Apollo Radio
Apollo Partners Ltd. has sold the Apollo Radio Holding Company, a New York company consisting of seven radio stations, to Regent Communications for $50 million.
Apollo Radio was owned by Apollo Partners Ltd., Chemical Venture Partners and Equitable Capital.

After this latest deal, Regent expects to be ranked among the top 35 radio groups in advertising revenue.
The radio stations involved in the sale of Apollo Radio are KALL-AM, KKAT-FM and KODJ-FM in Salt Lake City; KMXV-FM and KUDL-FM in Kansas City, Mo., and WEZL-FM and WXLY-FM in Charleston, S.C.

Morrison Restaurants Inc.(RI,N) reports earnings for Qtr to Jun 3


A Balance Of Unknown And Familiar
The State Philharmonic of Bialystok is the second of two orchestras whose New York performances have been protested by the local musicians union, which argues that Mid America Productions has imported the ensembles because they are less expensive than American musicians, not because they are particularly good.
In the case of the first ensemble, the Bohuslav Martinu Philharmonic, an undistinguished performance of the Verdi Requiem in May suggested that the union had a point.
But on purely musical grounds, the aggrieved union can have no complaint about the Bialystok orchestra, a Polish ensemble founded 41 years ago and conducted by Miroslaw Jacek Blaszczyk since 1990.
The orchestra's playing was polished and energetic, its wind and string timbre was beautifully focused, and its program was a good balance between the familiar and the unknown.

Since 1974, when her son and husband disappeared during the war, Maria Theodoulou has doggedly implored the Virgin Mary for help.
When she wakes up and when she goes to sleep she kneels before the Virgin's image.
She has twice made pilgrimages to a shrine on the Greek island of Tinos.
"A few days ago the Virgin appeared to me in a dream," she said, seated in her small house five miles west of Nicosia.
"She was in a boat coming in from the sea. She told me my husband was dead. She told me my son had gone to America. Wait, the Virgin told me, wait for your son to come home."

Lashing back at critics of his new labor agreement with the municipal unions, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday denounced suggestions from fiscal monitors that he should have extracted more concessions as "outrageous," "crazy" and "off the wall."
City workers, he said, had made more than their share of sacrifices to help balance the budget, and those who maintain otherwise have a "political agenda," though he did not spell out what that agenda was.


Supply Exceeds Demand for Ph.D.'s in Many Science Fields
THE holder of a doctoral degree in science or engineering would probably make a better taxi driver or bank teller than someone without a Ph.D.

As if that were not bad enough news for young scientists, the authors of the report have concluded that increased government spending for scientific research, even if it were granted, would eventually make the job situation even worse.

U.S. to Assess Kodak's Case Against Fuji
In what is shaping up as the next focus of trade friction with Japan, the Clinton Administration announced today that it would investigate charges by the Eastman Kodak Company that its rival Fuji Photo Film had conspired to deny it fair access to the Japanese market over the last 20 years.
The American move, made less than a week after the two countries pulled back from the brink of sanctions and settled a bitter automotive-trade dispute, was based on a 275-page complaint filed by Kodak in mid-May, contending that the Japanese Government had helped Fuji create an anticompetitive market, costing it $5.6 billion in sales.

And the buoyant stock market, by producing substantial gains on investments, has allowed corporations to meet their pension obligations with only minimal extra contributions.


Russians Inspired By America
A long-running rock band and a reunited jazz sextet, both from Russia, performed on Saturday night in a JVC Jazz Festival concert at Avery Fisher Hall.
All they shared musically was a lack of audible Russian roots.
Mashina Vremeni (Time Machine), the rock band, was founded in 1969 by Andrei Makarevich and survived varying degrees of Communist disapproval.
Last year it celebrated its 25th anniversary performing for 50,000 fans in Red Square.
According to Artemy Troitsky's "Back in the U.S.S.R.," a history of Russian rock, Mr.
Makarevich's lyrics didn't reflect official optimism.
The songs, couched in metaphor, were hopeful but disillusioned; they decried conformism and passivity to encourage more ethical behavior.


New Analysis of the Parthenon's Frieze Finds It Depicts a Horrifying Legend
STANDING in columned splendor atop the Acropolis of Athens, the Parthenon is the paragon of classical architecture and has long been a shrine of Western civilization.
The Greeks built this temple to the goddess Athena in the fifth century B.C., in the golden age of Pericles.
Marble statues portrayed the mortal and immortal greats, and at the center was a huge cult statue of Athena.
Set high above, on all sides in the shadow of the exterior colonnade, was a 524-foot-long frieze in low relief depicting various stages of what appeared to be a single solemn ceremony.
A cavalcade of mounted soldiers was followed by people bringing animals to sacrifice and bearing offerings by musicians, maidens and elders.
They approached a central scene above the east entrance, where among other figures, a man and child held a large cloth.

He fled to Jordan afterward and was arrested by the Jordanian police.


Matsuoka, Not So Reverent Now, Is Ready for Sampras
What has become old hat for the likes of Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras, surviving into the quarterfinal round at a Grand Slam tournament, represents the chance of a lifetime for a tall Japanese player who first fell on his back and then leapt up and did a victory lap around the Wimbledon hintercourt that provided his rite of passage on Monday.
Shuzo Matsuoka's father, Isao, could get his son into pictures, but that has never been the son's goal; instead, the best and only male Japanese prospect has pursued the same career his father pursued before becoming a film company executive in Tokyo.


Clean Water: A Midstream Approach
Within the year, the 104th Congress may rewrite the Clean Water Act, the Superfund program, the Endangered Species Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and portions of the Clean Air Act.
In short, it may redesign the entire framework of environmental protection that has been developed over the past 25 years.
That could have salutary results.
The laws need to be redrafted to prune red tape, cut back the natural accretion of bureaucracy and, most important, reflect the findings of the latest scientific and economic research.
Unfortunately, Congress seems poised to leap far beyond such level-headed revision and instead reverse more than two decades of environmental progress.


Market Place; A selloff by Microsoft executives may be fallout from a failed deal.
MANY of the top executives of the Microsoft Corporation seem to be very eager to sell shares of the software giant as the introduction of the company's Windows 95 operating system nears.
At the same time, as Microsoft's stock price has soared the company has cut back on purchases of its own stock.
Figures released on Monday by the company showed that during the three months that ended June 30 it spent just $34 million on share repurchases.
That was down from $104 million in the prior quarter and from a record $318 million in the last three months of 1994.
It was the lowest figure for any quarter since the final three months of 1992, when the company did not repurchase any shares.


International Briefs; Credit Lyonnais Sells Brazilian Unit to Itau
Credit Lyonnais said yesterday that it had sold its Brazilian retail banking subsidiary, B.F.B., to Banco Itau S.A., Brazil's second-largest private bank, for 1.6 billion French francs, or $335 million.
The sale included Credit Lyonnais' 53.9 percent stake in B.F.B. and its 100 percent stake in B.F.B.
Leasing.
With 45 branches and 2,900 employees, B.F.B. was Credit Lyonnais' largest retail network in South America.
The French banking company bought it in the late 1940's.
A Credit Lyonnais spokesman, Olivier Perrain, said B.F.B. was sold to Itau "slightly above its asset value." Credit Lyonnais has been rapidly shedding assets in an effort to become profitable before the French Government sells it to the public.
The company will maintain a presence in Brazil geared toward large companies. (Bloomberg Business News)


Fed Rate Step Won't Ignore Bond Market
Speculation has been building for weeks about whether signs of an economic slowdown will lead Federal Reserve policy makers to reduce short-term interest rates when they meet here Wednesday and Thursday.
But the key question before the central bank's officials may lie in how well financial markets would withstand a decision not to cut.
The Federal Reserve prizes its independence from Wall Street and from the White House: "No one forces our hand," a Fed Governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, said in an interview last week.
Still, the Fed's leaders take many of their cues from the bond market.

The Mossberg shotguns, the Ruger Mini-14 semiautomatic rifles with fiberglass folding stocks, the stubby Mac-10's, and the Beretta and Glock 9-millimeter pistols were laid out in neat rows in the hall of the Holiday Inn here this weekend.
There were piles of holsters, camouflage clothes, shells for reloading and, as at gun shows around the country, a booth with the latest issue of The Spotlight, the newspaper of the extremist anti-Semitic group Liberty Lobby -- its banner headline warning "Clinton Plans for Mideast War" -- and stacks of defiant bumper stickers, including one depicting a red, horned President and the words, "Clinton is the Anti-Christ."

Such problems are also the focus of concern in China itself.


METRO DIGEST
DESPITE TOLL STRIKE, TRAFFIC MOVES WELL
The combination of a toll collectors' strike and hundreds of thousands of holiday motorists was widely expected to bring congestion of historic proportions to New Jersey's busiest highways, but things were surprisingly smooth, with fewer traffic problems than on many other holidays.  [ Page A1. ]
TAX BREAKS: POORER PETER, RICHER PAUL?
At a time when the New York City and State governments are cutting sharply into spending for schools and social services for the poor, they are providing hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and other benefits to big businesses.
The Pataki and Giuliani administrations say the tax breaks are part of a long-term strategy to shore up the local economy by keeping big employers from leaving New York.
In other states, they say, such enticements abound.
But a growing number of critics question whether a strategy of broadening tax breaks to business makes sense while cities and states are doing some of the most far-reaching budget cutting in decades.  [ A1. ]

A PHOTO OPPORTUNITY FOR THE I.N.S.
If the Immigration and Naturalization Service in New York City gets its way, those huddled masses yearning to breathe free who turn up at its offices at 26 Federal Plaza will have to cope with market forces.

Lower Budgets Don't Cut Flow Of Tax Breaks
At a time when the New York City and State governments are cutting sharply into spending for schools and social services for the poor, they are providing hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and other benefits to big businesses, including some of the nation's largest corporations.
The Pataki and Giuliani administrations say the tax breaks, which have gone to such corporatons as ABC and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the Wall Street brokerage concern, are part of a long-term strategy to shore up the local economy by keeping big employers from leaving New York.
In other states, they say, such enticements abound.


Command Performance for the G.O.P.


TORIES PICK MAJOR AS LEADER AGAIN, BUT SPLIT REMAINS
John Major was easily re-elected as leader of the ruling Conservative Party today, insuring his survival as Prime Minister but not gaining the decisive triumph that would have stamped his authority on a fractious party.
Mr.
Major received 218 votes from the 329 Tory Members of Parliament eligible to vote.
His challenger, John Redwood, a 44-year-old former Cabinet member, received only 89.


Gonzalez Recalled as a Fiery Competitor
With his big serve and fiery competitiveness, Pancho Gonzalez was an emotional and formidable presence in tennis, say those who watched him and played against him.
"He was a super competitor," said Jack Kramer, who induced Gonzalez to turn professional and play on his tour in the 1950's.
"He figured a way to get out of trouble. He seemed to hit his best shots on crucial points.


The Antic and the Archetypal
Intelligence, wit and originality: these qualities stand out in the work of Nathalie Pernette and Andreas Schmid, two young choreographers whose experimental dance troupe from France has just made its United States debut at the American Dance Festival here.
At first glance, the duo, who call themselves the Compagnie Schmid-Pernette, seem to work on a miniature scale.
As things turn out, this is a misleading impression, fueled by the engaging demeanor that Mr.
Schmid, who is Swiss, and Ms.
Pernette, who is French, show off as dancers.


Personal Health
BRAIN tumors are on the rise and no one knows why.
It would be hard to find a family in which at least one member or friend has not had a brain tumor.
Since most brain tumors produce symptoms, like headaches, that are commonly caused by far less devastating disorders, they are often ignored or dismissed as unimportant.
As a result, a correct diagnosis is not made until the tumor reaches a size that may make definitive treatment impossible.
Many brain tumors, if caught early, are curable.
And even those that cannot be cured can often be treated in a way that gives patients years of quality life.
Dramatic improvements in diagnosis and new and improved treatments, including the use of a noninvasive radioactive "knife" and chemotherapy and still-experimental immunotherapy and gene therapy, offer hope for cure or at least long-term control in patients who just a decade ago would have been doomed.


An American Manifesto for a Desirable Future
THE NEXT AMERICAN NATION The New Nationalism and the Fourth American Revolution By Michael Lind 436 pages.
The Free Press. $25
Excepting the immodest few who run for top public office, not many observers of the passing scene would have the audacity to present their ideas for the collective American future as a "manifesto." It is a measure of his boldness that Michael Lind does just that.


Method to End 20-Week Pregnancies Stirs a Corner of the Abortion Debate
A new debate has flared in the long-smoldering fight over abortion, focusing on a rarely used method to end pregnancies that have reached more than 20 weeks of gestation.
It is, both sides agree, a distressingly gruesome process that in its last stages involves removing an intact fetus by suctioning out the brain to make the head fit more easily through the birth canal.


Unlocking the Secret Lives Of Storage Bins
EACH day in New York, countless taxis pull up to the loading docks of self-storage centers, and out of them roll harried apartment dwellers, lugging plastic garbage bags over their shoulders and blowing their bangs out of their eyes.
From the trunk of the cab they pull things they literally cannot live with yet choose not to live without, like sweaters from high school, boxes of photos of people they do not recognize and golf clubs.


Helms Puts the Brakes to a Bill Financing AIDS Treatment
Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who has vigorously fought homosexual rights, wants to reduce the amount of Federal money spent on AIDS sufferers, because, he says, it is their "deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct" that is responsible for their disease.
Moreover, he argues, AIDS is only the ninth-leading cause of death in America but accounts for more Federal financing than diseases that kill more people (an assertion not supported by Public Health Service figures).


All the Roads Are Straight In Mexico
ROUNDING a blind curve on a one-lane dirt road as it began the plunge to the bottom of a chasm that seemed steeper and deeper than the Grand Canyon, Mike Nelson, a k a Mexico Mike, wanted to clear up a misconception or two about driving in Mexico.
"One misconception is it's unsafe," he said, nonchalantly guiding the steering wheel of his pickup truck with one hand.
"The reality is it's safer than in the United States."


Whitman Signs Second Part Of Cut in State Income Tax
After marching down Main Street in a small-town July 4 parade, Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman signed into law the second half of her promised 30 percent income tax reduction.
The Governor selected this small borough in the middle of suburban Middlesex County because, she said, its own tax cutting efforts symbolized what she was trying to do to bring taxes and government spending under control.


CHRONICLE
Twenty years ago, an ore carrier broke apart in a gale on Lake Superior, carrying 29 crewmen to their deaths and inspiring the GORDON LIGHTFOOT ballad "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald." Ever since, the ship has lain undisturbed 538 feet below the surface of Whitefish Bay, off eastern Michigan.
Yesterday, the ship's bell was raised, and a dozen relatives of the victims looked on as it was brought aboard the Canadian Navy's ship Cormorant.
"It was quite a cheerful moment," LARRY ELLIOTT, a spokesman for the mission, told The Associated Press.


China's Cloud Over Hong Kong: Is '97 Here?
Day by day, signs great and tiny of Britain's waning colonial presence are becoming more apparent here, as is the looming shadow of China, this territory's soon-to-be master.

A Coup in Hot Dog Land
Mike DeVito is no longer top dog.
Mr.
DeVito, 33, of Manalapan, was overthrown yesterday as the champion of hot dog eating, when a 350-pound Nynex engineer from Queens beat him by half a wiener in the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest on Coney Island.
Mr.
DeVito, a 6-foot-2-inch, 205-pound vice president for Salomon Brothers, had won his fourth state hot dog eating championship in Jersey City on June 24 and was a three-time world champion before meeting his match in Edward Krachie, who had finished second to Mr.
DeVito in last year's world championship at Nathan's Surf Avenue tube-steak mecca.


The Ground Glass of Reality
One of the best-kept secrets in America is that the O.J.
Simpson trial is no longer a disaster.
Another is that television coverage has helped set things right.

Even though Judge Ito has brought the fiasco under control, almost no one has noticed.


Why We Need Student Drug Tests; Unintended Results
To the Editor:
The Supreme Court has ruled that random urine testing of high school athletes is constitutional.
However, this does not mean it is wise.
While drug testing might deter some athletes from using drugs, it may also deter some drug users from participating in organized sports.


Dangerous Nuclear Tests
There is ample time and good reason for France's new President, Jacques Chirac, to reconsider his reckless decision to resume nuclear tests under a coral atoll in the Pacific come September.
Paris invokes the familiar explanation that it needs to conduct a limited number of low-yield underground tests to insure the reliability of its stockpile.
But scientists do not agree that testing is necessary for these purposes and a majority of French public opinion opposes renewed tests.

But with at least $6 million of television advertising scheduled for this year, you may know more.

Prescription Fee of $10 Won't Save Anything
To the Editor:
It would be useful to ask those responsible for a "pilot project" to charge $10 for each prescription at Elmhurst Hospital Center and Queens Hospital Center in New York City as "a cost-saving measure" how much money they propose to save (news article, June 26).


Temple U.'s Dispute With Philadelphia Stalls a Giant Sports Complex
On a Saturday afternoon in June 1994, Temple University's executive vice president, James S. White, was in his office putting the finishing touches on testimony he was to give before the City Council two days later.
After several years of land acquisitions, engineering studies and negotiations with business and civic groups, the university appeared close to breaking ground on an $80 million sports arena and business complex for the blighted inner-city neighborhood surrounding Temple.
Only a few routine city ordinances were still needed, and the mood in Mr.
White's office, as he recalled, "was real high."


Looking at Skin Color, Rather Than Pedigree

Traffic Moves Surprisingly Well In New Jersey Despite Toll Strike
The combination of a toll collectors' strike and hundreds of thousands of holiday motorists was widely expected to bring congestion of historic proportions to New Jersey's busiest highways today, but into the evening hours things were surprisingly smooth, with traffic problems less than on many other holidays.
By 10 P.M., highway authorities reported no major trouble spots related to the strike on the New Jersey Turnpike and a "sickout" at the Garden State Parkway, and officials at both the turnpike and the parkway said regular employees were returning to their posts.
Traffic was moderate and moving steadily in most places, and the authorities said any delays were caused by the normal tie-ups that come on a holiday, no matter who is operating the tollbooths.


Boeheim Faults Study
Syracuse Coach JIM BOEHEIM says that a National Collegiate Athletic Association study on athlete graduation rates is faulty.
The study, which tracked incoming freshman classes from 1985-86 through 1988-89, showed the Orangemen's basketball team at the bottom of the Big East and more than 20 percent below the national average.


Tenement Is Briefly Seized In East Village
With tactics befitting commandos, a band of squatters briefly took control of a city-owned tenement in the East Village late yesterday, six weeks after illegal occupants were evicted by police in riot gear.
Hundreds of police officers, many wearing helmets and carrying nightsticks, and backed by two police helicopters that swept the area with searchlights, surrounded the building at 541 East 13th Street near Avenue B shortly after the takeover about 10 P.M.

The Anti-Tax Man Cometh
Individual income taxes, Irwin A. Schiff tells everyone who will listen, are voluntary, but almost everyone pays because politicians have enacted complicated laws to trick people into thinking they must pay.
The view might sound absurd, and Mr.

But some Americans are taking it seriously.


Sponsorship Buys Championship Stake
The Sponsorship Group, a sports marketing holding company in London, said it had acquired 70 percent of the Championship Group, a sales promotion and sports marketing company in Atlanta and Chicago.

A New Tune: Freedom Not to Pay Taxes
Twenty-six years ago, Richie Havens opened the Woodstock music festival with his signature anthem, "Freedom," a hoarsely passionate cry of the heart that expressed the rage and defiance of a youthful America against a seemingly monolithic, authoritarian Federal Government.
Some things change; it is now the right that is generally associated with decrying the centralized power in Washington.
But some things don't; Mr.
Havens still does not like the Government.
And he often expresses this in his live performances by telling audiences -- "reminding them," is how he put it in a recent telephone interview -- that paying Federal taxes is voluntary.


International Briefs; CPC International to Buy Dalgety Snacks Business
Dalgety P.L.C. of Britain said yesterday that it would sell its Golden Wonder Instant Hot Snacks business to CPC International Inc. of the United States for $:180 million, or $287 million.
Dalgety put the business, as well as its Homepride unit, for sale in February when it acquired the Quaker Oats Company's European pet foods business for $:442 million.


Sports of The Times; One Friend Explains It: That's Murph
THE missing-persons bulletin makes it official.
This is one of the weirdest Wimbledons ever.
Normally, everybody is on best behavior on these hallowed grounds except for the occasional McNasty, who got away with testiness because he was a genius.
This year, three marginal players have gotten themselves disqualified for eccentric actions through the first eight days.


Man Is Attacked and Burned
A man walking home from church in Newark yesterday was attacked and thrown into the trunk of an abandoned car that was then set on fire, the police said.
Angel Ortiz, 53, was listed in critical condition at University Hospital with burns over 20 percent of his body.


Rivera May Have Said Final Goodbye to Columbus
Mariano Rivera must have imagined he was pitching at Cooper Stadium, not Comiskey Park.
He must have thought he was opposing Class AAA hitters, not Frank Thomas and the White Sox.
No wonder, for Rivera was as cool and confident and commanding in his start today for the Yankees as he has been at Columbus this season.
What a pleasant surprise.


Why We Need Student Drug Tests; The Choice Is Ours
To the Editor:
Amid the alarmist coverage of the Supreme Court's validation of mandatory drug testing for high school athletes (front page, June 27), we must keep in mind the limited scope of the Court's holding.
That holding does not have the power to prescribe mandatory drug testing.


Jockeying for Block Grants
The Republicans act like they want to chop the last four words from President Clinton's pledge to "end welfare as we know it." They propose doing away entirely with the 60-year-old entitlement that guarantees Federal and state money for poor mothers.
Instead, the Republicans want Washington to turn fixed pots of money, called block grants, over to states to spend on the poor, or slash to inconsequence, as they please.
The block grants are being sold as a solution to the Federal deficit and a deterrent to out-of-wedlock births.
Washington would no longer spend more money every time state welfare rolls swell.
Nor could teen-agers count on government to help pay the cost of raising children.
But the G.O.P. is fast learning that block grants are no magic elixir.
The proposal has stalled in the Senate in a battle among states over how to allocate the block grant money.


Lyman G. Parratt, 87, an Expert In Precise X-Ray Measurement
Dr.
Lyman G. Parratt, an X-ray researcher and former chairman of the physics department at Cornell University, died on Thursday at his home in Redmond, Ore.
He was 87 and had lived in Ithaca, N.Y., until last year, having been associated with Cornell for more than six decades.
The cause of death was cancer, his family said.


G.O.P. WOULD GIVE PENTAGON MONEY IT DIDN'T REQUEST
For the first time in more than a decade, the budget being prepared by Congress locks in military spending at much higher levels than even the Pentagon requested and comes close to ending the post-cold-war decline in arms spending.
The Clinton Administration and some outside experts say the Republican spending plans are larded with throwbacks to the era of the Soviet threat, like more B-2 bombers and a potpourri of pork-barrel projects from amphibious assault ships to day-care centers.


A Family Awaits Notification
It was a somber Fourth of July for the Bakes family, awaiting final word on the fate of Frank Bakes of Fort Lee, believed buried in the rubble of a shopping center that collapsed in Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday.
"We still have a shred of hope, and that's what we're clinging to," Mr.
Bakes's son, Peter, of Boston, said yesterday from his mother's home in Northvale.


Professor Asks Bomber to Forgo Violence
In an open letter to the serial mail bomber known as the Unabomber, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley said that he agreed with some beliefs expressed by the self-described anarchist but that he strenuously disavowed the bomber's violent means.
The letter, published today in The San Francisco Chronicle, was written by the professor, Tom R. Tyler, in response to a package he received on Friday.
The package contained a manuscript described by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as similar to a 35,000-word manifesto sent to The New York Times and The Washington Post by the bomber last week.
The professor, who teaches social psychology, had been quoted in an article about the bomber published in The Chronicle in May.


Why We Need Student Drug Tests
To the Editor:
"Unwarranted Student Drug Testing" (editorial, June 28) is wrong in asserting that we have "adequate law enforcement remedies already available" for dealing with adolescent drug use.
Although substantial reductions in levels of drug use occurred during the 1980's, there is powerful evidence of a recent reversal of this trend among young people.


Egyptian Group Says It Tried to Kill Mubarak
A Muslim militant group battling the Egyptian Government for more than a decade took responsibility today for an attempted assassination of President Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopia last week, saying that killing Mr.
Mubarak remained its "sacred duty."
The organization, the Islamic Group, said in a statement that it will stop attacks against Egyptian Government officials and security forces when Mr.
Mubarak releases thousands of Islamic militants, lifts emergency security laws and institutes an Islamic theocracy.


Encountering A Medium, And Others
There is nothing about Rosemary Altea that would suggest she speaks to people "on the other side" -- people who have, in earthly parlance, died.
Ms.
Altea (pronounced al-TEE-ah), a 49-year-old English spiritualist, doesn't look like a fortuneteller or a seer.
She doesn't wrap silk scarves around her head, drape herself in robes or finger crystal amulets strung around her neck.


Food Notes
Where Smokers Can Smoke
Not one but two pocket-size books will be available in bookstores next week to help beleaguered smokers find where they are welcome.
"The Smokers Guide to Dining Out in New York City" by Alan Yeck (Salmeri Publishing, $9.95) gives more than 200 restaurants that allow smoking and includes the number of seats available to smokers in each.
"Lighten Up New York," edited by Michael Leo (Leo Communications, $9.95), lists more than 1,800 restaurants in New York City and the Hamptons that ban smoking, along with those that permit it and where their "smoking seats" are located.
Food ratings based on published reviews and guidebooks are given only for restaurants that allow smoking.
A New Nectarine
For the next few weeks, Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas (Ninth Street), will be selling a new type of nectarine from California with a greenish skin and a deep yellow-colored flesh.
The store is calling the fruit mango-nectarines because they bear a slight resemblance to mangoes even though they taste like very delicious nectarines.
The price is $5.98 a pound.
About New England Cuisine
On July 17 from 6 to 8 P.M., Titus O. Thompson, a chef and teacher, will give a lecture about foods of New England at the Old Merchant's House Museum, 29 East Fourth Street (near Broadway).
There will be a sampling of food and wines after the lecture.
Admission is $25 and must be reserved in advance; (212) 777-1089.
Off the Menu Goodbye to Reidy's
Reidy's Restaurant, 22 East 54th Street, closed permanently last Friday.
The Irish pub, in business since 1947, will be replaced by a brewery-restaurant with Asian food that is being budgeted at $1.5 million.
Bill Reidy, the owner of Reidy's, is retiring.
With an Asian Touch
In about a month, Singapore Sally will be making its debut at 478 Amsterdam Avenue (83d Street).
Etan Nisanov, the owner of Bendix Diner in Chelsea, is opening what he calls "an Oriental restaurant with an American interpretation.
The owners of Aja (pronounced "Asia"), in the Flatiron district, plan to open a cafe in the fall at 200 Madison Avenue (36th Street), featuring interpretive Asian food.
Summer Break
A number of restaurants will be closed for vacation or will follow different schedules during the summer.
Vacation schedules for Le Cirque and Lespinasse will be determined now that hotel workers in New York have reached a tentative agreement with hotel owners on a new contract.


Environment Gets a Push From Clinton
Sensing broad public support for strong environmental protection, the Clinton Administration has begun taking a much more combative stance against a wide array of Congressional proposals that would weaken several major environmental laws.
Administration officials say the more forceful strategy, which includes increasingly frequent threats of Presidential vetoes, reflects new polling data suggesting that the Republican Congressional majorities' current barrage of votes to roll back environmental regulation will return to haunt them.


'Health Food' Good Enough for the Skeptics
Sacred Chow, 522 Hudson Street (near Charles Street), is a new food shop with quite an agenda.
Everything is prepared without animal products, refined sugar or white flour.
But this is no hippie holdover.
Cliff Preefer, the chef and owner, prepares delicious food without the strange flavors often typical of "health food." A richly seasoned tart is layered with soy and fennel "sausage," fresh tomatoes and garlic in a tender spelt and barley pastry, and a whole-wheat crust encloses a stunning fresh peach filling ($4 a slice each, $24 whole).
A lemon-caramel custard of silky tofu and tapioca could satisfy the sweetest tooth.
Salads, like those made with seaweed ($7.25 a pound) and couscous ($5 a pound), are also tasty.
The muffins are a trifle heavy, and the chocolate-chip cookies had a strong dose of mint.


Ultimate Rerun: History
At first glance, it might look as if NBC has caught the public-television bug.
Over the summer, on Sundays at 7 P.M., the network is presenting a documentary series called "Lost Civilizations," the kind of project usually associated with PBS.
What's up?
Well, it's summer, and this acquisition, officially titled "Time-Life's Lost Civilizations," is no doubt considerably cheaper than most television entertainment fare.
Better yet, with two outings so far, the series of 10 hourlong programs is holding its own against competition like ABC's "America's Funniest Videos." History lessons.
What a concept for network prime time!
Time-Life is, of course, in the business of packaging theme sets for distribution through television commercials and in video stores.
Giving the product a television showcase evidently enhances sales prospects.
That's what happened recently with the special syndication arrangement for Time-Life's 10-part "History of Rock-and-Roll." The marketing of "Lost Civilizations" keeps building until late August, when retail sales begin at $19.99 a tape or $159.99 for a complete set.
Dance the synergy shuffle.


Abbott Starts Over In Chicago
Jim Abbott is free.
Free from the criticism about the diminishing speed of his fastball, free from the chatty owner who barked the most about, of all bizarre things, his charity work.
And free from having to read about his trials on the mound.
Abbott, set free from New York when the Yankees failed to re-sign him, said Chicago agrees with him; he is even living in a big city again.


Camden Aquarium Changes Lures; Forget the Local Color, Brighter Fish May Attract Visitors
For years the accepted wisdom about the mad public love for fish under glass meant that anybody could build an aquarium, and people would turn out in the millions.
Then the New Jersey state aquarium tampered with the formula by specializing in local fish.
There are a lot of brown fish in New Jersey waters.
Brown flounder.
Brown cod.
Even much of the water is dun.
The aquarium almost single-handedly brought down the national statistics for aquarium attendance and worse, it failed to prove the engine of redevelopment envisioned for this impoverished city across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.


Israel and the P.L.O. Set Stage for Pullout
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization outlined an agreement yesterday on Israeli troop withdrawals in the West Bank that sets the stage for Palestinian elections and expanded self-rule.
The two sides fixed July 25 as the date for signing a completed deal.
But there was no guarantee they would meet that date because many details must still be worked out, including arrangements for troop movements, elections, transfers of civil authority and the release of jailed Palestinians.


A Breach in the Church-State Wall
The Supreme Court has blown a hole through the wall of separation the Constitution was supposed to maintain between church and state.
By a 5-to-4 vote last week the Court held that the University of Virginia must subsidize the publication of a student-run evangelist magazine just as it subsidizes other student-run publications.
The high court's reasoning, faulty in itself, holds the danger that it might later be used to justify government subsidies for other religious enterprises.
The Court's majority ruled that the First Amendment's ban on the establishment of religion was trumped in this case by the same amendment's free speech guarantee.
The state of Virginia through its university is thus required to pay the religious magazine's printing bills once it underwrites other student publications.


CHRONICLE
Her seemingly privileged childhood was not a fairy tale but a dark make-believe, the singer CARLY SIMON says in the current issue of Vanity Fair magazine.
"There was no truth, because we were living this Tennessee Williams play," she says.
"We were responding like an audience to a play, as opposed to living the lives of the characters. It was so convoluted it was unreal."
Ms.
Simon said that her mother, who died last year, had a long affair with a man hired to be the companion of the singer's brother, and that her father, the book publisher Richard L. Simon, had a long liaison with a woman 18 years his senior.
Ms.
Simon said this unsettled home life helped explain her stammer, stage fright, neuroses, obsession with sex, and success in music, The Associated Press reported.


Fight Erupts In Prison, Injuring 13
A fight involving 300 inmates, apparently over a stolen gold chain, erupted on Monday evening at the state prison in Gouverneur, N.Y., leaving about 13 injured, one seriously, officials said yesterday.
The fight at the medium-security prison, about 25 miles from the Canadian border, pitted a group of black inmates against a group of Hispanic prisoners.
But officials refused to characterize the upheaval as racial.
James Flateau, a spokesman for the Department of Correctional Services, said the incident was still under investigation and would not comment on a possible cause.


Sports of The Times; Indians and Fans Help Revive a Sick Game
AT close of day, an attorney for the law firm of Reminger &amp; Reminger shut his office door on the eighth floor of the 113 Building on St.
Clair Avenue in downtown Cleveland Monday, pulled down the window shades, removed his pinstriped suit and glasses and donned his Cleveland Indians cap and Cleveland Indians T-shirt.
Suddenly, Gary Goldwasser, as on numerous other occasions this year, was transformed from a mild-mannered lawyer into, well, SuperFan!
And, with briefcase in hand, off to the ball game he went -- Jacobs Field is just a few blocks away.
He is not alone.
And won't be alone.


Gambling Industry Sees Gains
The gambling industry celebrated the holiday with news that business is up over this time last year.
New revenue figures from the Casino Association of New Jersey show an increase of 11.5 percent over June 1994.
Eleven of the 12 gaming halls saw increases, posting $318.9 million for June.
Caesar's was the only casino to decline.

I.N.S. Withdraws a Helping Hand
IF the Immigration and Naturalization Service in New York City gets its way, those huddled masses yearning to breathe free who turn up at its offices at 26 Federal Plaza will have to cope with market forces.
The I.N.S. is getting tough.
Maybe it is impossible to keep track of green card violations and it is hard to assure humane conditions for people awaiting deportation.
But taking on a 63-year-old nonprofit group authorized by Federal law to help newcomers obtain identification photographs at low cost, that's another matter.


Violence Flares Again on Ulster Streets, Ending Brief Lull
The street violence that raged into the early hours of Tuesday morning in Roman Catholic areas of Belfast and other parts of Northern Ireland resumed Tuesday night, with the police reporting at least 50 incidents involving the hijacking and burning of cars and the hurling of firebombs at vehicles and police officers.
A spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, or police, said at 12:45 A.M. that there was "general disorder" in Catholic areas in West and North Belfast.
There were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests.
The continuing violence is the first sustained public disorder since the Irish Republican Army began its cease-fire 10 months ago.


Metropolitan Diary
DEAR DIARY:
A silver-haired man boards the Second Avenue bus.
The seats are occupied; standees fill the aisles.
A college-age woman, observing the gent, rises and offers him her seat.
The aged man pauses a moment.
No words are exchanged as he grasps the overhead bar with both hands and "chins up" two times as the student and others observe the muscular scene.
JOSEPH I. MIZER  SUMMER'S BOUNTY  Summer brings us outdoor music:
Beethoven, Bach and Boccherini.
Unfortunately, it also brings
an unstoppable flood
of squash and zucchini. PETER FRIEDMAN Dear Diary:
A Long Island Rail Road train stops at Freeport, and a 20-something couple get on and sit beside me.
He has a resonant voice and is relating his life story and his philosophy of life, including a lot of pop-psych jargon.
I become engrossed in my book and shut out his voice.
But as the train leaves Jamaica, he begins to expound on women, saying that they are essentially inferior and need male guidance, that they really can't function without male assistance.
I close my book and glance across the aisle and make eye contact with another woman.
We both roll our eyes and communicate wordlessly as the diatribe goes on.
When the train slows for Penn Station and everyone stands up, I turn to him and say, "You know nothing about women!" Spontaneous applause -- the car is full of women.
The train stops.
He races to the door, and just before it opens, he leans into the car and shouts, "You are all in denial!" VERA MEYERSON Spotted by C. Wetter of Stamford, Conn. in local newspaper of Sedona, Ariz.:
A SEDONA FIRST  In response to recent proclamations from the offices of the Attorney General, we are proud to announce that for the health of your loved ones, all of our caskets are smoke-free.
Sedona Funeral Home Dear Diary:
I've seen a number of odd sights in my daily walks from the Staten Island Ferry to my office at the World Financial Center -- a gaggle of French and Japanese tourists dancing the hokeypokey while waiting to board the Miss Liberty; a crowd of lethargic Wall Street types lounging around the Battery Park benches (they turned out to be movie extras) -- but nothing beats the sight I saw at the Battery Park City esplanade on a recent June morning.
There was the usual sprinkling of early morning strollers, dog walkers and joggers.
Then, I suddenly realized that a rather large animal was galloping toward me at full speed from the north end of the esplanade.
It was a New York City police horse in full patrol gear, sans police officer.
I and a security guard moved out of harm's way and stared in stunned silence as the chestnut-colored animal ran past us, heading toward the south end of the esplanade.
Apparently making a last-minute, but wise, decision not to charge headlong into the wisteria gazebo, and thence into the drink, the horse made a sharp left, hind legs slipping and sliding and raising a cloud of dust.
Then it disappeared, heading in the general direction of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and perhaps onward to greener pastures somewhere out on Long Island.
I turned to look back in the direction the runaway horse had come from and saw two more police horses approaching -- riders attached -- in hot pursuit.
From this vantage point, of course, the runaway could not be seen.
The first cop looked at us questioningly.
I couldn't resist.
I pointed and yelled, "He went that-a-way!" MARIANNE SCARINO

"He was the best player who never won Wimbledon." DON BUDGE, tennis champion, on the death of Richard (Pancho) Gonzalez  [ D9:1. ]


AT THE NATION'S TABLE: Portland, Ore.; An Imaginary Cafe That Serves Real Food
While many people may imagine opening a restaurant, Caprial Pence may be the only chef to list an imaginary one in the telephone book.
The listing is for "Caprial's Cafe," a cooking show, and Ms.
Pence has been its host for the last year on the Learning Channel.
She said that so many viewers called information in Portland, Ore., to make reservations at the cafe that she and her husband, John, decided to list it with the telephone number of the Westmoreland Bistro, the name of the real restaurant and wine shop they run.


Tragic Figure Beneath A Crown Of Fruit
Decades before celebrities were dissected for their iconographic significance, Carmen Miranda rose to become Hollywood's reigning symbol of the Latin American spirit.
Portraying vivacious, fiery-tempered women with names like Rosita and Chiquita in a series of 1940's movies for 20th Century Fox, the star, wearing an elaborate fruit-basket headdress, sang tongue-twisting pop-samba numbers while dancing sinuously and flashing her dazzling smile.
In lavish production numbers imitated by everyone from Esther Williams to Bette Midler, Miranda embodied camp before the concept was invented.
At the same time, her screen image purveyed a garish cartoon of Latin American culture that was condescending for being so relentlessly frivolous.


Portuguese Group Gives Fado a Modern Twist
The hauntingly melancholic music known as fado is as much a part of Portugal's identity as, say, its tawny port wine.
But if wine improves with age, fado has simply been growing old.
Living off its former glory but stuck in its ways, it has become a must for tourists but of little interest to a younger generation brought up on rock and pop.
That, at least, was the view of two young Portuguese musicians in the early 1980's.
In a country that was at last opening up after decades of isolation and dictatorship, fado seemed to represent the past.
So the two men opted for rock, seeking a Portuguese sound through their own compositions.
Yet unavoidably, their music was still derivative of imported rock.


Russia Says It Will Keep Army In Chechnya Permanently
In what served as a rebuke to the Chechen rebel leader's renewed demand for independence, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia issued a decree today ordering Russian military units to be permanently stationed in Chechnya.
Moscow has said all along that it planned to keep troops in Chechnya if and when a political settlement to the conflict there is reached.
In exchange for a substantive withdrawal of troops, Chechen negotiators had tentatively agreed to return to what was the military status quo before the war.
But the timing of the decree, set against new obstacles in the peace talks, mainly seemed aimed at reasserting Russian authority over the secessionist region.

Did U.S. See the Light In Japan Trade Talks?
To the Editor:
"Why the U.S. Takes Guff From Weaklings" (Week in Review, July 2) suggests that the United States made concessions in the trade talks with Japan because the Clinton Administration was dealing with a weak coalition Government in Tokyo that could not be pushed too far.


Echoes of the Gilded Age: A Mansion Rises on 72d Street
This is about a New York City mansion with five fireplaces, a swimming pool in the basement and two gardens -- a lower one for post-swim strolls and an upper one reachable by a bridge from the house.
The mansion is not a century old and (surprise) does not have a name like Carnegie, Morgan, Mellon or Rockefeller in front of it.
In fact (bigger surprise), it has not even been built yet.


International Briefs; Abbey National Bids To Buy First National
Abbey National P.L.C. said yesterday that it had offered to buy First National Finance Corporation, a consumer credit company, for about $:285 million, or $453 million.
The deal would double Abbey National's 1.5 percent share of the unsecured lending market in Britain, a market dominated by four big banks: Barclays, National Westminster, Midland and Lloyds.
Abbey is Britain's second-largest mortgage lender and the country's fourth-largest banking company, but it has lagged behind in consumer finance as a result of its origins as a building society, broadly equivalent to a savings and loan in the United States.
Abbey became a bank in 1989.


BUSINESS DIGEST
Fuji Complaint by Kodak Shrugged Off in Japan  To officials at Eastman Kodak, perhaps, their complaint charging Fuji Photo Film and the Japanese Government with conspiring to block Kodak's entry into the Japanese photographic market might be as clear as a well-focused snapshot.
But in Japan, the case seems more blurry than that.


After a 5-Day Linkup, a Flawless Undocking


Bailey Rides an Old Horse And 3 Others to Victory
They have run the Suburban Handicap in New York for 109 years, and it has been won by such heroes as Forego, Foolish Pleasure, Easy Goer and the last two years by Devil His Due.
So it became something of a footnote to history yesterday when the traditional race was won by a 7-year-old retread named Key Contender, who was bought and rejuvenated last November by Carl Lizza and his trainer, Jose Martin.
Key Contender outran a smart but not particularly distinguished field of nine other horses, beating Kissin Kris to the wire by one length, with Federal Funds third.
It was the first time in his career of 48 races that Key Contender had raced a mile and a quarter and the first time he had won a stakes race.
And, yes, he earned $210,000 for winning, which was more than the $170,000 shelled out by Lizza to buy him from Paul Mellon's Rokeby Stable.

Man Charged With Helping Ill Wife Kill Herself
A man who helped his gravely ill wife commit suicide with a drug overdose in their Upper West Side apartment yesterday was charged with manslaughter, the police said.
Myrna Lebov, 52, had suffered from multiple sclerosis since 1973, but her condition had deteriorated rapidly in the last 18 months, finally placing her in a wheelchair, the police and neighbors said.


Excerpts From One Right-Wing Author's Script for the Future
The following are excerpts from "The Turner Diaries," a novel first published in 1978 that has become a textbook for right-wing extremists.
The novel, set in the future as the newly discovered diary of a participant in a race war at the end of the 20th century that establishes a New Era, portrays a revolution pitting the Organization, an underground white group, against a Jewish-dominated Government, blacks and other members of minorities, who are killed or deported.
As the story begins, the Cohen Act has made gun ownership illegal and the Supreme Court has voided rape laws as discriminatory (because men cannot be raped), leading to the widespread rape of white women by black men.
Banding together in clandestine cells, groups of whites establish the Organization, financed by robbing Jewish merchants and counterfeiting.
They blow up the F.B.I. building, stage a mortar attack on Congress, establish a beachhead in California and finally triumph, with the hero perishing in a suicide nuclear-bomb attack on the Pentagon in a light plane.


International Briefs; New Warburg Venture Fires Chief Economist
SBC Warburg, formed at the start of the week by the merger of the investment banking businesses of the Swiss Bank Corporation and S. G. Warburg Group P.L.C., has dismissed George Magnus, Warburg's chief economist, and 40 other Warburg employees, those close to the situation said yesterday.
Spokesmen for Warburg and Swiss Bank declined to comment.
SBC Warburg, which has more than 11,000 employees, is expected to lay off about 1,000 over the next four weeks, with 60 percent of the reductions on the Warburg side and 40 percent at Swiss Bank. (Bloomberg Business News)


Engineer's Ice Plant Helps Power County
In this northern region of San Diego County, residents are accustomed to heat, horses and avocado orchards.
But now they are getting used to an incongruous addition -- a complex that creates electricity, steam and hockey rinks.
Therein lies the tale of a power entrepreneur who understands that business, like hockey, is about playing the angles.
In this case the angles were his technical knowledge of cogeneration power production, the local utility's begrudging obligation to pay him a juicy premium for this power, and Escondido's willingness to grant him tax breaks if he helps revitalize a blighted area.


Three Executives Named at BBDO
BBDO New York, a unit of the Omnicom Group, has made three top executive appointments.

Milbury To Become Islanders' Next Coach
The Islanders, as expected, have scheduled a news conference this morning at which they will appoint Mike Milbury the sixth head coach in team history.
Although contract terms have not been given, the 43-year-old Milbury, a former defenseman, head coach and assistant general manager of the Boston Bruins, is believed to have agreed to a five-year deal in the $4 million range.
That would put him in the upper echelon of National Hockey League coaches as far as salary is concerned.


Foreign Affairs; Half A Loaf
In trying to determine whether the latest U.S.-Japan trade accord on autos is a good deal or a bad one, I'm reminded of what Chairman Mao reportedly said when asked what he thought of the French Revolution: "It's too soon to tell."
To be sure, it is troubling to note how happy the Japanese are with this deal.
Any deal Japan is happy with is a deal the U.S. should worry about.
Japan is a country with structurally closed markets and a $130 billion global trade surplus.
If your negotiating outcome with Japan is "I'm O.K., you're O.K.," then you're probably not O.K.


A Rough Year For Farmers Appears Likely
Cold, wet spring weather across much of the Midwest, followed by a searing dry spell in early June, has set the table for what could be a rough year for many farmers.
An average or even slightly better than average grain and soybean harvest is still possible, analysts say, but shortfalls seem more likely.
Problems with this year's crop already are translating into higher prices for livestock feed, costlier ingredients for food and beverage companies and higher prices for industrial consumers of agricultural products.
Little of the expense has filtered through to consumers, but that could change if continued weather problems hamper the current harvest of winter wheat and the progress of crops planted this spring.


Device Transforms Brain Surgery
TO Christine Tejada and her family in Brooklyn, the procedure known as Gamma Knife radiosurgery is nothing short of a miracle.
When she was 8, Christine was found to have a life-threatening blood vessel malformation in her brain and was scheduled to undergo risky invasive surgery that would have hospitalized her for perhaps 10 days and been followed by weeks or months of recovery and rehabilitation.
Instead, she was treated successfully in Chicago without so much as a slit in her scalp.

With a Complex Space Ballet, U.S. and Russian Linkup Ends
Whirling through space at nearly five miles a second, 10 American and Russian astronauts today took apart the world's largest spacecraft as easily and flawlessly as they had put it together five days ago, ending the first East-West linkup in two decades and clearing the way for future cooperative ventures.
The elaborate disassembly began early today as a Russian Soyuz spaceship carrying two Russian astronauts undocked from the sprawling space complex, made up of the 112-foot-long Russian space station Mir and the 122-foot-long American space shuttle Atlantis.


Too Brilliant for the World's Good
Was Leni Riefenstahl a Nazi?
Or a Nazi collaborator?
Or just a Nazi employee?
More than 60 years after the making of her masterpiece, "Triumph of the Will," the questions persist.
And in a long segment of "The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl," she answers them, in her fashion.
The fashion is to zig and zag, like an actress trying out her emotional range, from outbursts of impatience to airs of innocence to complaints of unfairness to repeated assertions of the artist's prerogatives: she was no Nazi, just an artist.
Tonight's three-hour biography, which was shown at the 1993 New York Film Festival, finds Ms.
Riefenstahl looking and sounding remarkably youthful, all things considered: smartly got up; memory intact, though occasionally at odds with the memories of others, and full of pep, particularly when justifying her political or apolitical past.


Japanese See Kodak Case As Hardly Black and White
To officials at the Eastman Kodak Company, perhaps, their complaint charging Fuji Photo Film and the Japanese Government with conspiring to block Kodak's entry into the Japanese photographic market might be as clear as a well-focused snapshot on a bright summer's day.
But here the case seems a lot more blurry and indistinct than that.
On Monday, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said his office would investigate charges by Kodak that it had been denied fair access to the Japanese market during the last 20 years.
Today, Fuji and Japanese Government officials dismissed Kodak as a sour-grapes loser and ruled out negotiations concerning the new trade fight that looms between Japan and the United States.


Pennies That Add Up to $16.98: Why CD's Cost So Much
For years, music lovers have been complaining about high CD prices.
If a CD costs as much to have manufactured as a vinyl record, their logic goes, then why does it cost so much more to buy?
The response from record labels has been to raise CD prices even higher.
Rod Stewart's new CD, "A Spanner in the Works" (Warner Brothers), which arrived in stores last month, is a good example.
It carries a $16.98 list price, the same as most CD's by established stars, and more than 100 times the cost of the materials used to manufacture it.


Peace Talks Open Anew in Mexico


Wine Talk
THE famous pianist and sometime Polish statesman Ignace Jan Paderewski liked zinfandel.
On the eve of World War I and at the height of his fame as an artist, he bought a 2,000-acre property, Rancho San Ignacio, near Paso Robles, in San Luis Obispo County, on the central coast of California.
Ten years later, after he had served a term as Prime Minister of the Polish state created by the Treaty of Versailles and had made a triumphant return to the concert stage, he planted a zinfandel vineyard at his California property.
When the vines matured, the wine was made for him by the nearby York Mountain Winery, then, as now, one of the best-known wineries between Los Angeles and San Francisco.


Woman Accosted at an A.T.M.
Gloria Wroten was using an automated teller machine at her bank early Monday when she was approached by a man who pointed a handgun at her, then fled on foot when she screamed.

One fired a shot at him, the police said.
Mr.
Hightower ducked, and when he looked up the men were gone.


Cooling Off on the Mall


CHRONICLE
A man who said he was WHITNEY HOUSTON's brother has agreed to leave her alone.
STEVEN J. MARRIOTT of Lloyd Harbor, L.I., signed court papers on Monday consenting to have no contact with the singer, her family or her management company.
The agreement, approved by Superior Court Judge Kenneth MacKenzie in Morristown, N.J., was reached after Ms.
Houston sued Mr.
Marriott last month, The Associated Press reported.
The suit said Mr.
Marriott sent Ms.
Houston flowers at her management company's office in Fort Lee, N.J., and called her several times demanding to speak with her.


New President at Whitman
David M. Barse has been named president of M. J. Whitman Inc., a securities brokerage and money management firm known for its skill in trading the debt of troubled companies.
Mr.
Barse, who had been chief operating officer of the firm, is succeeding Martin J. Whitman, who will remain chairman and chief executive.
As president, Mr.
Barse, who is 33, will oversee the daily operations of the firm and its subsidiaries.
He joined Whitman in 1991 as general counsel after working as a lawyer specializing in bankruptcy, corporate and securities law.


Cubs Hit Saberhagen Not Often, But Early
The instant that Brian McRae lined Bret Saberhagen's second pitch of the game out of the park last night, you just knew it was going to be another long evening for the Mets at Shea Stadium.
McRae, as it turned out, provided just about the only offense for either side.
Along with his homer, he tripled and doubled, just missed another extra-base hit with a drive that landed a few inches foul, and scored the only three runs of the game.


Journal; The Lost Frontier
For those of us old enough to recall dropping everything to watch the black-and-white TV image of Alan Shepard's 15-minute ride in a space capsule in 1961 -- or who remember just where we were when Neil Armstrong took those first steps on the moon -- it was heartening to see the space program capture the country's imagination once again over Independence Day weekend.
Except for one small detail.
It wasn't America's space program that thrilled hearts -- it was Hollywood's.
Though there actually are some NASA astronauts up in the sky at this very minute, they are hardly the ones captivating the country.
The astronauts of choice are Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon -- not whatstheirnames.
The space vehicle of the moment is the ill-fated Apollo 13 of 1970 -- not the trouble-free shuttle Atlantis of 1995.
And while millions of paying customers lined up to make "Apollo 13" the No. 1 box-office smash of last weekend, evidence suggests that hardly anyone dropped anything to watch live TV coverage of Atlantis's rendezvous with the Russian space station Mir last Thursday.
The story didn't even make the first segment of the networks' evening news.


Courtyard Caves In at Harlem Apartments
As several children played a few feet away, a section of the courtyard of a city-owned apartment building in Harlem collapsed on Monday afternoon.
No one was injured, but the six-story building was sufficiently undermined that city officials evacuated all 30 families, the police said.
A police spokesman, Officer Arek Tarih, said the 15-by-4-foot section of the courtyard in the building at 550 West 144th Street collapsed about 5:30 P.M.
Monday.
The rubble left a hole 10 feet deep and exposed a rusting girder below the 30-foot-square courtyard, just inside an archway on the south side of 144th Street.

"I feel better, I feel stronger, my tests are better and my head is great."


Indian Politics Derail a Big Power Project
A few months ago, it seemed like an ideal match.
On one side was India, now open to foreign investment but starved of the electrical power needed for economic growth.
On the other was a consortium of major American companies with a contract to invest nearly $3 billion in an advanced power plant outside Bombay.
When paperwork on the contract was completed in January, the consortium, led by the Enron Corporation of Houston, a big natural-gas supplier, was the jewel in the crown of a budding new business relationship between India and the United States.


Martinez Survives Without a Red Carpet
Conchita Martinez, the defending Wimbledon champion who hasn't exactly been treated like royalty by the committee that doles out the coveted assignments for Center Court, left herself just two steps short of a perfect defense of her one and only Grand Slam crown today.
Back on Center Court after being banished to the grassy suburbs of this complex ever since she made her mandatory first-round reappearance on the main stage, the third-seeded Spaniard survived a strange interlude with eighth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), in the quarterfinals.

One Man's Journey From Academia to Extremism
For nearly two decades, as leader of a white supremacist organization called the National Alliance, William L. Pierce of Mill Point, W.Va., has held a prominent position among Americans with strong racist, anti-Semitic or anti-government views.
A former professor of physics and research scientist, he became a leader of the America Nazi Party and, in 1978, wrote a novel, "The Turner Diaries," that quickly became a favorite of right-wing fringe groups around the country.
In graphic detail, the story tells how an underground group kills Jews and blacks as part of an overthrow of the Government.


Running the Offense, When to Run Is Enough
Tomas Murray lost his right basketball shoe but hardly a step as he stopped to retrieve the shoe, slipped it back on and then stole the ball from the player he was guarding.
Those rapid-fire movements during a game held to assess talent at the Special Olympics World Games last Saturday would have evoked cheers at any basketball game.
But in this instance, they elicited a roar, because Murray has only one leg and, without a prosthesis, runs up and down the court on that one appendage.

In Planning Takeover of Newark Schools, New Jersey Shifts Its Style
The State Department of Education, often vilified in Jersey City and Paterson for imposing school takeovers that have failed to improve student performance, is attempting to change its style as it moves on Wednesday toward the takeover of Newark's unwieldy, crumbling school system.
Stung by criticism that its outside management teams had too little local experience and were too stuck to their desks in Trenton to effect change, state officials are trying to paint the Newark takeover as something different.
State officials have set up a toll-free telephone number for concerned parents to ask questions or offer advice.
They stress that the final management team will be chosen only after consultations with local ethnic groups and have sought advice from Mayor Sharpe James, who no longer opposes the move.

What Exactly Does a Jackbooted Thug Wear?
To the Editor:
It is most curious that among the multitude of references to and repetitions of the word jackboot (mainly with regard to the epithet "jackbooted government thugs" by Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's executive vice president), there has not been a definition of what exactly a jackboot is.
An informal survey confirms that the meaning of jackboot is not generally known.
Now again, in your June 28 news article about the worldwide spread of skinhead violence, appears this statement: "Cruel history has taught us that we dare not ignore the first sounds of jackboots."


Pancho Gonzalez, U.S. Tennis Champion, Dies at 67
Richard (Pancho) Gonzalez, a two-time national champion whose pride and passion on a tennis court were as compelling as his natural talent, died Monday night in Las Vegas, Nev.
He was 67.
The cause of death was stomach cancer, said Gonzalez's former wife, Rita Agassi Gonzalez, who said that Gonzalez had entered Sunrise Hospital two weeks ago with a fever.
He seemed to be improving and was watching Wimbledon every day, she said, but then he developed pneumonia and doctors found that the cancer had spread.
"Pancho deteriorated very quickly," said Agassi Gonzalez, who is Andre Agassi's older sister.


Israel and P.L.O. Reach Accord on Pullout and Election
After months of failure and frustration, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization outlined an agreement today on Israeli Army withdrawals in the West Bank that set the stage for Palestinian elections and expanded self-rule.
The two sides fixed July 25 for signing a completed deal.
But there was no guarantee they would meet that target because many details must still be worked out, including arrangements for West Bank troop movements, elections, transfers of civil authority and releases of Palestinians from Israeli jails.

Record of Violations Found At Courtyard Collapse Site
New York City housing officials have been trying since 1992 to arrest a landlord who is a principal owner of a Harlem building where part of the courtyard collapsed Monday, an official with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development said yesterday.
The owner, Moishe Bodner, is well known to officials for "serious violations" of the city housing code at a number of buildings, including the site of the collapse, said Deborah Boatright, a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, and several court cases have been pursued against him.
Mr.
Bodner is a principal in the corporation that owns the building, Two B Holdings, Ms.

She added that the corporation's owners are currently in bankruptcy proceedings.

Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a new debate over abortions late in pregnancy referred incorrectly to a technique described graphically by the newsletter of the National Right to Life Committee.
Like most of the article, the newsletter dealt with a rarely used procedure known as "intact D &amp; E," for dilation and evacuation, in which the fetus is delivered intact -- not the more widely used D &amp; E, in which the fetus is broken apart inside the uterus and then suctioned out.

"On Race, It's Thomas v. an Old Ideal" by David J. Garrow (Week in Review, July 2) discusses Justice Clarence Thomas's opinion that federally enforced school integration implies that all-black education is inherently inferior.
No one seems to ask whether segregated schooling (de facto or de jure) is healthy for white Americans.


Takeo Fukuda, 90, Ex-Premier And Backer of China Pact, Dies
Takeo Fukuda, who as Japan's Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 was instrumental in concluding a treaty of peace and friendship with China, died yesterday in the hospital of Tokyo Women's Medical College.
He was 90 and lived in Tokyo.
The cause was chronic emphysema, the Kyodo news service reported.


Florida Governor Stricken by Mild Stroke
Gov.
Lawton Chiles, a 65-year-old Democrat serving his second term, was hospitalized here today after experiencing a temporary blockage in the blood flow to his brain.
Mr.
Chiles, who served three terms in the Senate before winning the Florida governorship in 1990 and narrowly winning re-election last November, was stricken by what his doctors called a transient ischemic attack.
The condition is often a precursor to a severe stroke, said Dr.
Charles Maitland, a neurologist who treated the Governor.

Sports of The Times; The Real College Champions
IF graduating is the premise justifying so-called student-athletes at America's colleges, too many athletes are not students at our institutions of what is apparently higher perspiration, not higher learning.
By itself, that is hardly news.
Virtually a century ago educators discovered that, no matter how unstudious the student, a tradition of winning teams in leather helmets translated to a tradition of ticket-buyers and alumni contributions.


Comptroller Sues to Block Pataki Pension Fund Plan
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall filed suit today to prevent Gov.
George E. Pataki from using money in a special pension fund to balance the state budget, a move that could open a $110 million hole in the spending plan.
The fund in question was created in 1970 to augment the pensions of retired state and local workers whose benefits had been eroded by inflation.
But the Legislature never touched the money until last month, when it authorized Mr.
Pataki to use $110 million of the $360 million account to help close a projected budget shortfall of nearly $5 billion.


Devils Talks Are Continuing
More talks were held yesterday between officials of the Devils and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority in an attempt to resolve the Stanley Cup champions' future at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.
"There's nothing new, just that discussions are ongoing," said John Samerjan, a spokesman for the authority.


Corrections
An obituary on June 28 about Marvin Camras, an electrical engineer and inventor, referred incompletely to the invention of magnetic tape recording.
While Mr.
Camras received a patent in 1944 for "method and means of magnetic recording," related technology existed earlier, especially in Germany.
In 1928, Fritz Pfleumer received a German patent for a magnetic recording tape.


PENTAGON DIVIDED BY RADAR JAMMER
For nearly three years, 102 electronic radar-jamming devices have gathered dust in a Navy warehouse in Indiana while Pentagon officials argued about what to do with them after testers concluded the devices were not fit for use.
Now the Navy has found a solution: send some to Marine Corps pilots patrolling the skies over Bosnia, who asked for the devices because they believe the jammers have to be better than what they have -- Vietnam-era issue.


No Delay of Game Now On Giants' Draft Picks
The Giants have signed one of their fourth-round draft picks, the former Nebraska offensive lineman Rob Zatechka, according to his agent, Joe Linta.
Zatechka is believed to have signed a three-year deal worth about $700,000 (including a $195,000 signing bonus).
Although that is important -- Zatechka is the first of the Giants' 1995 draft picks to sign -- there is something more significant about the agreement: the timing.
While he has been criticized in the past for negotiating slowly, General Manager George Young has done anything but tarry when it has come to this season's draft picks.


CHRONICLE
A piece of Camelot -- Hammersmith Farm, the Newport, R.I., estate where John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier's wedding reception was held -- was put up for sale yesterday.
The asking price is $9.5 million.
The 50-acre property is currently owned by a group of 10 Massachusetts businessmen who want to be known only as Camelot Gardens &amp; Associates, CHRIS BURR, the real-estate agent, said yesterday.
The group bought the property in 1977 for $850,000 from Janet Lee Auchincloss, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's mother, and has been giving tours there.


Accord Is Close on Seles
Negotiations among the top players regarding Monica Seles's protected ranking upon her return are coming to a close.

Where's the Stealth In Clinton Adviser?
To the Editor:
"The Stealth Strategist Refocusing Clinton" (front page, July 1), your article about the resurgent Clinton adviser Dick Morris, seemed both confusing and unfair.


Whitman Takes On Labor for Makeover
There were plenty of cheers for Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman over the long holiday weekend.
She signed the latest installment of her 30 percent income tax cut, she wrenched a state labor contract to a settlement on terms highly favorable to the state, and then finessed a potentially crippling holiday strike by toll takers on the state's major highways.
This first-term Governor, who has become a national symbol of state tax-cutting, is to a great degree accomplishing her plans to remake New Jersey into a leaner, more business-hungry state by taking on the state's 60,000 unionized employees.
Her determination was clear over the holiday in the confrontation with toll takers on the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway, when the roadway authorities she controls deployed strike-breaking replacement workers to staff the tollbooths.


34-Year Veteran Quits Salomon
Salomon Brothers continues to lose top executives.
William A. McIntosh, a managing director and a member of the brokerage firm's executive committee until April, said yesterday that he would leave.
His decision, after 34 years at Salomon, is a measure of the continuing dissatisfaction among some of the firm's top executives.
Mr.
McIntosh, 56, declined to comment on the reasons for his resignation, but colleagues said he had been stripped of much of his power in a reshuffle earlier this year when he was replaced as head of the firm's fixed-income business.
He has no new job, but has told colleagues that he intended to work elsewhere.


No More Mr. Nice Guys
Bob Dole slipped off his blue blazer at the last minute.
Maybe when he saw a platter with a giant hog's head wearing a "Dole for President" bumper sticker and an American flag, he realized it was a casual affair.
But as he stepped on stage in his French cuffs and blue silk tie, he still looked awfully starchy for a political pig roast on the Fourth of July.
Fortunately, he was lining up for a photo with some of the other Republican contenders, so starchy was not a liability.
Here they were, paying homage to persnickety New Hampshire conservatives and smiling under a scalding sun, the hope of the G.O.P.: Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, Pat Buchanan.
Bob Dornan was also there.


Largest Teachers' Union Calls for National High School Exam
The nation's largest teacher's union called yesterday for the United States to follow the lead of European countries by instituting a common academic curriculum and a national examination for high school students.
The goal would be to improve the education of students who do not go to college and to give employers better information about students' abilities, said the union, the 875,000-member American Federation of Teachers.
It said national tests in Germany, France and Scotland, the three places it studied, provided greater incentive for students to work hard because almost all were tested, not just those who planned to go to college.


International Briefs; Compass Group in Talks To Buy Accor Unit
Compass Group P.L.C. said yesterday that it was in serious talks to buy Eurest International, a unit of Accor S.A. of France, for about 4.5 billion French francs, or $930 million, in a deal that would create the world's largest caterer.
Compass is already the third-biggest caterer in the United States and buying Eurest would "complete the jigsaw," a spokesman said.


SYBRON INTERNATIONAL TO BUY NUNC GROUP FROM BTR
The Sybron International Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Nunc companies from BTR P.L.C. of Britain for about $170 million in cash.
Nunc manufactures disposable plastic laboratory products used in analyzing and storing cells.
The companies are Nunc Inc. in Naperville, Ill.; Nunc A/S in Roskilde, Denmark, and Nunc G.m.b.H. in Wiesbaden, Germany.
Sybron, based in Milwaukee, develops and markets dental and laboratory supplies.
The company had sales of $439.7 million last year.


CHRONICLE
Once again, WOODY ALLEN has been defeated in his effort to gain custody from the actress MIA FARROW of his three children, The Associated Press reported.
New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, dismissed his appeal yesterday to have overturned the lower court that awarded her custody of the children, Moses, Dylan and Satchel Farrow.


For a 'Maverick,' Some Breathing Room
Even more than giving Packard Bell a big, technologically powerful partner, NEC's $170 million investment gives the privately held computer maker the cash to remain independent, analysts said yesterday.
Packard Bell Electronics Inc. has been in need of cash to maintain its lead and sustain its phenomenal growth in the home computer market, the fastest-growing segment of the computer business.
In recent weeks, articles in the trade press have reported that the company was seeking a buyer.


The Pop Life
When compact disks first started appearing in record stores in the mid-1980's, many people warned that they would one day make vinyl albums extinct.
But few people said anything about the threat they posed to cassettes.
This was probably based on two assumptions: both CD's and LP's are round and have a hole in the middle and both are used primarily for playback rather than recording.
But sales of pre-recorded cassettes have slowly and steadily been shrinking, to a point where one day music stores may no longer even carry them.
"A lot of our stores don't stock a good variety of cassettes anymore," said Renee Tyler, a product manager at Tower Records headquarters in Sacramento, Calif.
"A couple of our stores have even gotten rid of cassettes altogether."


Effort to Reduce Overtime Pay Is a Key Issue in the Toll Strike
Beneath all the blustery language and flashes of temper, a basic issue in the labor strife on the New Jersey Turnpike is management's continuing campaign to cut overtime pay that reached nearly $12,800 for each toll collector last year.
Union concessions made months before Monday's eight-hour strike have allowed the New Jersey Turnpike Authority to reduce last year's costs.
But the executive director of the authority, Roger E. Nutt, insisted during the walkout that management wanted further retreat by unionized collectors on the overtime issue.

George Leon Weil, 87, Physicist Who Helped Make Atomic Bomb
George Leon Weil, a physicist who assisted in the birth of the atomic age, died last Saturday at the Georgetown House retirement home in Washington.
A longtime Washington resident, he was 87.
He had suffered strokes and heart problems, according to the DeVol Funeral Home in Washington.


U.S. Ends Ticketmaster Investigation
The Justice Department announced yesterday that it was closing its investigation into complaints of anti-competitive practices by Ticketmaster.
The computerized ticketing giant had been under Federal inquiry and the focus of Congressional hearings since last year, when the Seattle grunge band Pearl Jam charged Ticketmaster with cutting the group out of bookings in a dispute over fees.
The decision to close the case without action caught Ticketmaster by surprise, a spokesman in Los Angeles said.
There was no immediate reaction from Pearl Jam, either, which just last week canceled its national tour over continued booking problems and then reinstated two dates, one through Ticketmaster.


Prices Climb As Traders Await Fed's Rate Decision
With trading subdued as investors and dealers awaited the outcome of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Treasury securities moved higher yesterday.
Plenty of market analysts do not expect the committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, to cut short-term interest rates during the meeting, which began yesterday.
But if the committee acts, it is likely to do so today.


World News Briefs; Jailed Colombian Near Top of Drug Cartel
Jose Santacruz Londono, who was arrested in a Bogota restaurant late Tuesday, is regarded as one of the top three leaders of the Cali drug cartel and the chief operator of the largest cocaine processing and distribution network in the United States, American officials said today.
"His capture may affect the cartel's operations in the United States to the degree that it sends off a flow of ripples to the rest of the pond," Thomas Constantine, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said today in a telephone interview from Washington.


Firm Suspends Stock Trader In $128 Million Fund Loss
First Capital Strategists Inc. said yesterday that it had suspended the securities trader whose unauthorized bets on the direction of the stock market ran up a $128 million loss in the account of the Common Fund, First Capital's largest client.
The firm also said it was "winding down its index arbitrage program." That was the investment strategy whose execution was overseen by Kent Ahrens, the 39-year-old senior trader who, First Capital and the Common Fund say, has admitted making the unauthorized trades.

Proposals to build thousands of housing units and millions of square feet of commercial, office and industrial space in a 32-square-mile tract in the New Jersey Meadowlands made significant progress yesterday when five government agencies agreed on a draft environmental impact statement to guide development of the area over the next 20 years.
The plans call for a cleanup of 27 landfills, with the $900 million cost divided among developers and various public agencies.

U.S. Transportation Deaths Rise
Transportation deaths in the United States rose to 43,134 last year, up by 384, or 0.9 percent, from 42,750 in 1993, according to a preliminary count by the National Transportation Safety Board.
Highway and street accidents contributed the biggest part of the growth and caused the largest number of deaths.
Deaths on major airlines jumped to 237 in 1994 from 1 in 1993, because of three crashes: USAir in Charlotte, N.C., on July 2, and near Pittsburgh on Sept. 8, and American Eagle in Roselawn, Ind., on Oct. 31.
No common link in the airline crashes has been found; indeed, investigators have been unable to determine any cause for the Pittsburgh crash, a Boeing 737 on approach to the airport.

Giuliani Appointee Retains Position on School Board
The Board of Education re-elected a Mayoral appointee, Dr.
Irene H. Impellizzeri, as vice president yesterday, even though a majority of members blame Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for driving away Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines.
The board president, Carol A. Gresser, who leads a five-member coalition that has been at odds with the Mayor, said she had voted for Dr.
Impellizzeri in part because she wanted to avoid another rift with City Hall.

Drought Fears Prompt Warning on Water Use
After three parched months in which the flow of water into New York City's reservoirs was the second lowest on record, Gov.
George E. Pataki yesterday declared a drought watch for New York City and Westchester County and called for voluntary measures to cut water use.
The reservoirs are not seriously depleted now, but without replenishing rains they could soon sink to levels that would trigger a drought warning and some mandatory conservation measures, New York City water officials said.
The 19 reservoirs, which also supply most of Westchester County's water, now hold 460 billion gallons, 11.4 percent below the norm for this date, the officials said.


An Educator Who Passionately Believes the Poor Can Succeed
In confronting the vast problems of Newark's schools, Beverly Hall is armed with 25 years of experience in urban education, strong leadership skills and -- most important -- a passionate belief in the ability of poor students to succeed, friends and colleagues say.
"Dr. Hall is a perfect example of an administrator who has demonstrated that in fact, all children can learn," Dr.
Lester Young, Superintendent of District 13 in New York City, said yesterday.


A Fast Pitch for Their Own League
The league has altered the size of the ball, monkeyed with the distance between the mound and the plate and made the infield roomier, all to inject more action into the game and to entice more fans.
No, it's not Major League Baseball.
Rather it is the budding Women's Professional Fastpitch, a two-team all-star barnstorming extravaganza currently peppering the Midwest on a 16-city tour with its play and staking out sites for a half-dozen or so teams for a league of their own next June.


Court Rejects Appeal of 5 In Rape Case
A ruling from the state's highest court today in a highly publicized case paves the way for prosecution of five men charged with raping a woman who passed out after drinking too much in a northern New York bar.
The Court of Appeals declined to hear an appeal from the men, who had originally been indicted on felony rape charges.
But in 1993, a town court permitted them to plead guilty to sexual misconduct, a misdemeanor.
Each paid an $840 fine, a punishment that outraged many women's and victims' groups and prompted Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo to name the Attorney General as a special prosecutor.
Last year, a Superior Court judge reinstated the felony rape charges, the decision that the five men sought to appeal.

International Briefs; Lufthansa Reports Return to Profitability
Deutsche Lufthansa A.G., which shocked investors with a first-quarter loss in May, said yesterday that it had returned to profitability in the first half of the year, and it forecast a successful 1995 despite turbulent currency markets.
"Pretax profit in the first half was above the year-ago period," the airline's chairman, Jurgen Weber, said.
In the first half of 1994, profit before taxes and special items was 135 million German marks, about $97.47 million.

. . . As We Know It
Begin by recognizing that welfare is a federally sponsored euphemism; when we talk about helping the helpless, we're talking about charity.
Charity is not a dirty word, though it is treated as such by many of those on the receiving end; they prefer "welfare," because it implies an entitlement with no need for gratitude.
On the contrary, the word "charity" -- the tangible expression of generosity toward our fellow humans -- rates right up there with love and kindness.

International Briefs; Britain's General Electric Sees Modest Profit Rise
The General Electric Company P.L.C., the British military and engineering company, said yesterday that it showed only moderate earnings growth in the year that ended on March 31.
A 2.9 percent rise in pretax profit, to $:891 million, about $1.42 billion, was below market expectations of $:895 million to $:934 million.
Profits fell at the company's electronic systems unit.

A chart on Friday showing how automobile insurance premiums will rise under new legislation passed in Albany labeled the figures incorrectly.

An Olympic Bonding; Time With Teammates Is Special, Too
It was twilight in front of Durfee Hall at Yale University, home for 13 days to the Louisiana delegation to the Special Olympics, and the 103 mentally retarded athletes were winding down after a long day of competing and cheering for each other.
The men's team handball squad had just lost in the final seconds to Tennessee 17-16, while the women's softball team, whose coaches had not expected to win a game, trounced Washington 13-4.
And so the handball players were subdued, retreating to their beds to stare at books, listen to music and sleep.
But the softball players could not stop giggling.
"The angels watching over us were willing to help out," Sonya Green said.

This Runner Inspires Respect
On Monday, Mark Straughn won a gold medal at 400 meters, on Tuesday a silver at 800 meters.
On Friday, he will be a favorite at 1,500 meters.
His best times are 2 minutes 6 seconds for the 400, 4:34 for the 800 and 8:58 for the 1,500.
Those times might not cause fear among Butch Reynolds, Sebastian Coe and Noureddine Morceli, the respective world-record holders at those distances, but they surely inspire respect.


Russian Press Free, Free to Go Broke
The arc of Vitaly Tretyakov's career sparked high in the electric days of perestroika and the new press freedoms that followed the demise of the Soviet Union.
But in the marketplace of a new Russia that is more interested in commerce than in big ideas, that is turning away from liberal democratic notions back toward corrupt bureaucratic management, Mr.
Tretyakov and his newspaper, Nezavisimaya Gazeta -- which was once as important to the intellectual and political elite as harsh cigarettes and thick black coffee -- have had a mighty tumble.

A year ago, when Olive Shisana became special assistant to the new Minister of Health, nearly every worker in the department was white, Afrikaner and male.

Russia Will Test a Trading Band for the Ruble
In an effort to increase investors' confidence and promote economic stability, Russian officials announced today that the ruble's exchange rate against the dollar would be fixed within a band and not allowed to float freely.
The creation of the trading band, which will be in place until Oct. 1, marked the first effort to fix the ruble's rate since the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had used differing exchange rates for different classes of commerce.


Acquittal Is Denied in NASA Bribery Case
A Federal judge today denied a defense motion seeking a judgment of not guilty for Dale Brown, the only man to go to trial on charges of corruption involving contracts at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Last week, a Federal District Court jury was unable to reach a verdict in the Government's bribery case against Mr.
Brown, reporting that it was deadlocked, 9 to 3, for conviction.

Budget Battles Undercut U.S. Information Effort
When President Eisenhower created the United States Information Agency in 1953, it was the darling of conservatives, a powerful megaphone to undermine Communism around the world.

Conspiracy Theories' Impact Reverberates in Legislatures
It was billed as a sort of town meeting for leaders of state governments.
Whatever its potential merits or shortcomings, the Conference of the States, as it was to be called, scarcely seemed a threat to the future of the Republic.
But some right-wing extremists saw the conference as nothing less than a clandestine Constitutional convention that could nullify basic American rights, perhaps as part of a sinister plot to impose a totalitarian "One World Government."

Primary Fight Goes to Round 3
There is an election in Jefferson Township that will not end.
Michael Glaab lost the June 6 Republican primary race for a seat on the Township Council to Debi Merz by 19 votes, and he asked for a recount.
When the recount gave him the election by 42 votes -- 685 for Mr.
Glaab to 643 for Ms.
Merz -- Ms.
Merz's lawyer, John Barbarula, filed suit, maintaining that there were "phantom votes" in at least one district, No. 11, where 86 people signed up to vote but 97 votes were cast.
After tests of voting machines, Judge Reginald Stanton of Morris County Superior Court ordered a new election, which will be held Aug. 15.


Economic Scene; Getting by without the Energy Department could be hard to do.
WOULD America be better off without the Department of Energy?
The rationale for creating the department in 1977 -- to break the economy's dependence on imported oil -- no longer strikes many policy makers as realistic or, for that matter, important.
Indeed, it was one of three (along with Commerce and Education) Cabinet-level agencies marked for extinction by House Republicans this year.
And it probably only survived because Pete V. Domenici, the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, has a soft spot for the Energy Department's laboratories in his home state of New Mexico.

The chairman, Rolf Ekeus, told the Council that the Iraqis admitted in a meeting Saturday in Baghdad that they had produced "large quantities" of two deadly biological agents, the bacteria that cause botulism and anthrax.
Iraqis maintain that the toxic agents were later destroyed.

Federal agents are investigating the financial dealings of former officials of the Transit Police Patrolmen's Benevolent Association before the union was disbanded last April, law enforcement officials said yesterday.
Aspects of the investigation were disclosed yesterday at a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan when Kenneth I. Wirfel, a lawyer for the union, demanded the return of medical expense records seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.


Lollapalooza Coming of Age as an Institution
The Lollapalooza Festival looked like an institution as it started its fifth summer tour with a sold-out show at the Gorge Amphitheater here today.
As usual, it was a daylong event with bands on two stages, exhibits, vendors, political leafletting and thousands of people wandering through it all.
Lollapalooza is a chance for an urban and college-town culture to visit the suburbs, while alternative-rock fans can show off a new hair color or navel ring to their semi-alienated, ticket-buying peers.
This year, the Lollapalooza name may be as much of a draw as the headliners, who on their own would fill clubs and smaller halls rather than arenas like the Gorge, with its capacity of 18,500.

CHRONICLE
About 54 years ago, SKITCH HENDERSON, the founder and music director of the New York Pops, visited his friend Bing Crosby in California.

AAR Corp.(AIR,N) reports earnings for Qtr to May 31


SYBRON INTERNATIONAL TO BUY NUNC GROUP FROM BTR
The Sybron International Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Nunc companies from BTR P.L.C. of Britain for about $170 million in cash.
Nunc manufactures disposable plastic laboratory products used in analyzing and storing cells.
The companies are Nunc Inc. in Naperville, Ill.; Nunc A/S in Roskilde, Denmark, and Nunc G.m.b.H. in Wiesbaden, Germany.
Sybron, based in Milwaukee, develops and markets dental and laboratory supplies.
The company had sales of $439.7 million last year.


'Improper Sales Practices' Cited in Warner Dismissal
The Warner Music Group dismissed Doug Morris as the chief executive of its United States operations because of "improper sales practices" that occurred while he was chairman of its Atlantic record label, according to documents the company filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Time Warner's music division contends that Mr.
Morris failed to inform his bosses about a scandal involving stolen compact disks when he negotiated a lucrative new employment contract last December.


Key Fibers Linked to Simpson Vehicle
Carpet fibers found with the bloody leather glove picked up behind O. J. Simpson's house and on a knit cap found at the crime scene match the extremely unusual fibers lifted off the floor of Mr.
Simpson's Ford Bronco, a prosecution expert testified today.
Because of a ruling last week by Judge Lance A. Ito, the witness, Douglas Deedrick, a specialist from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's division on hair and trace evidence, was not permitted to say just how distinctive the fibers are: that they appear almost nowhere, only in a limited number of Broncos made in late 1993 and 1994.
Those Broncos include Mr.
Simpson's, which prosecutors say he drove to the scene of the murders with which he is charged and then back home.

Israeli City Fears Becoming Frontier
On a road leading into this trim city of tree-lined streets, smart shops and red-roofed houses, motorists were greeted today with signs carrying a stark message: "Stop! Border Ahead."
The signs, hung by the rightist Likud party, were a warning that this community on the northern edge of the metropolitan sprawl around Tel Aviv may become a frontier town when Israeli forces withdraw from Qalqilya, a Palestinian city about two miles east in the West Bank.


At the Met, Britannia Rules Again
THREE prosperous-looking women stepped into the new Annie Laurie Aitken Galleries of English Decorative Arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art the other day, and one gasped.
"Look what they've done to my room!" she said.
But the censure gave way to a smile as she crept closer to inspect one room's elaborately stuccoed walls.
Once the dining room of a 1740's country house in Oxfordshire, the spacious chamber was for 41 years a frigid chalk white.
Now it is painted a rich mottled yellow that recalls egg yolks whisked into milk.
Sunny, warm and appealing, the shade is symbolic of the newly optimistic attitude of the Aitken Galleries.


A Court Running in the Wrong Direction
Radical change is under way at the Supreme Court, only three years after its center held against a strong right-wing campaign to overturn the Court's 1973 abortion decision.
As the term ended last week a five-justice majority was toppling doctrines and precedents that had held for decades and was looking around for more.
This is a heady time for opponents of what the Court has stood for at least since Earl Warren was Chief Justice.
It is a nervous time for supporters of the concepts of racial justice and national union that the Court has fostered for half a century.


Parents Surprised as Brooklyn Board Fails to Open Summer School on Time
Up to 3,000 children were left waiting at school doors yesterday morning in East New York, Brooklyn, when the district's summer school program failed to open as expected, wreaking havoc with parents' work schedules.
The confusion came after five of nine community school board members failed to attend two meetings at which the summer school budget was to be voted on.
Without a quorum, the budget resolution needed for summer school to begin could not be passed.
The board then failed to notify parents of the delay.


Signing Up Shoreline Advocates
United States Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, has asked colleagues from 30 states to join him in a bipartisan group that would look out for the nation's shoreline.
So far, Senators John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island; William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, and Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, have signed up for his Coastal Coalition.
The coalition will work on several environmental issues, including opposing efforts to scale back the Clean Water Act.


Celebrating Mixed Use
To The Home Section:
Your article about rezoning the flea market neighborhood  [ June 15 ]  describes the area as "a motley assortment of semivacant loft buildings, warehouses and parking lots." While writing it off that way is most convenient for politicians and developers, the area is, in fact, right now, the most genuine mixed-use neighborhood in the city, and it is thriving.


Thousands Seek Permits To Carry Concealed Arms
Randall Wright, an engineer for a military contractor, travels by subway to and from his Washington office and often works until 10 P.M.
That means walking past dark, unlighted stretches of woods between the subway stop and his home here in Fairfax County.
It is only a 15-minute walk, he said, but since Virginia this week became the sixth state this year to relax restrictions on carrying a concealed pistol, Mr.
Wright, 30, saw no reason to leave himself vulnerable to crime.


U.S. Seizes Latex Gloves
Marshals seized about 100 cases of imported latex gloves from a small Morris County distribution company yesterday, saying they did not meet Federal standards intended to protect against the transmission of disease.
In a civil lawsuit, the United States Attorney's office contends that Chester Laboratories imports gloves from Malaysia and India and sells them for medical uses without having them inspected by the Food and Drug Administration.
Bob Kennedy, president of the company, said that the gloves exceed Government requirements and that 90 percent are sold for industrial purposes.


METRO DIGEST
NEW JERSEY TO MANAGE NEWARK'S SCHOOLS The State Board of Education ruled that the Newark school system, the largest in New Jersey, had failed to give its students a minimum education for decades and would be taken over by a state-supervised management team headed by a top educator from the New York City schools.  [ Page A1. ] In confronting the vast problems of Newark's schools, Beverly Hall is armed with 25 years of experience in urban education.  [ B6. ]


Space Patient Is Prodded and Poked


Graf Is in Forefront Of a Familiar Lineup
It was almost a year ago, just after the nine-time champion Martina Navratilova ended her enviable Wimbledon singles career by coming in second to Conchita Martinez of Spain, that Navratilova made a prediction about what life would be like without her here.
"It's going to be like Steffi and the Seven Dwarfs," said Navratilova, who believes that Steffi Graf, already a five-time Wimbledon champion, is the only woman capable of breaking her record.
For Thursday's semifinal round, Graf, who hasn't lost a match this year, will be joined by the three women, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Martinez and Jana Novotna, who follow her on the seedings list.


Group Bullied The Homeless, Agency Finds
Federal housing officials canceled a $547,000 grant to the Grand Central Partnership yesterday after concluding there was "substantial evidence" that Partnership workers had harassed and brutalized homeless people.
"There's no doubt that these things happened," said Andrew M. Cuomo, an Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who made the announcement in Manhattan.


Bridge
The United States will be strongly represented in the Venice Trophy contest for women's teams, to be played in the world championships in Beijing in October.
The winning team in the American Trials, which were played over the last weekend in Alexandria, Va., included five players who have won world team titles: Kitty Munson, Sue Picus and Judi Radin, all of Manhattan; Rozanne Pollack of Warren, N.J., and Karen McCallum of Exeter, N.H.


Baylor Coaches Face Prison
When they came to Baylor in 1992, GARY THOMAS and KEVIN GRAY thought they had hooked up with a rising star as assistants to the new basketball coach, DARREL JOHNSON.
TROY DRUMMOND signed on a year later with similar hopes.
Johnson, who had won back-to-back N.A.I.A. national championships at Oklahoma City University before taking the Baylor job, was determined to turn the Waco, Tex., school into a basketball power.
Then the bottom fell out.


After the Fireworks, the Lady Goes to Pieces


The Twins Of Modernism, In Light and Dark
Some dwell in darkness and others dwell in light, goes the line in "The Threepenny Opera." Shades of light and dark, anticipation and despair, divide the otherwise closely allied work of Sofia Gubaidulina and Alfred Schnittke, the dominant figures in contemporary Russian music.
Unquestionably they belong together, having followed almost identical career paths.
Both were born in the early 1930's; both pursued an avant-garde program in the 60's in defiance of the Soviet regime; both have drawn on a broad range of contemporary techniques without becoming beholden to any of them, and both have taken refuge in Hamburg, Germany, in the turbulent 90's.
Yet the differences are substantial, even irreconcilable.
Mr.
Schnittke has placed himself in the main line of German tradition; he has passed the ultimate hurdle of Germanic art by writing his own "Faust." At the same time his work is marked by devastating pessimism, a certainty that classical traditions have come to an end.
Ms.
Gubaidulina, by contrast, has sought freedom and escape; she has avoided standard genres, used non-Western instruments, inclined toward improvisation, and cultivated a complex form of religious mysticism.


Baggio Signs With AC Milan
ROBERTO BAGGIO, soccer's world player of the year in 1993, left Juventus of Turin yesterday and signed with AC Milan for three years.
AC Milan, owned by the former Italian premier SILVIO BERLUSCONI, will pay a transfer fee of about $12.5 million to Juventus over two years.


At Lincoln Center in Summer, Fun Is Serious Business
At first glance, and even at the second and third, this year's Serious Fun festival at Lincoln Center looks as though it has abandoned the music-centered, provocative and sometimes grungy eclecticism of its early days and become an extension of the dance season.
Granted, it opens tonight at Alice Tully Hall with a potentially quirky theater piece, Robert Wilson's monologue version of "Hamlet." And the series, which runs through July 30, also includes a music-theater piece by the composer John Adams, the poet June Jordan and the director Peter Sellars.
Still, four of the six events in this final Serious Fun series (it is to be replaced next summer by an expansive new arts festival) focus on recent works by choreographers.
Mark Morris, Trisha Brown and Martha Clarke have used 18th- and 19th-century classical works.
A fourth work, "Degga," is a collaboration between the choreographer Bill T. Jones, the novelist Toni Morrison and the jazz composer Max Roach.


Smith Corona, a Computer Victim, Files for Bankruptcy
The Smith Corona Corporation, whose portable typewriters were an essential tool for generations of high school and college students, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday, a victim of the computer revolution.
The company said it had decided to seek bankruptcy court protection in Delaware to stabilize its operations, obtain additional financing and carry out a restructuring plan.
Less than a week ago, the company installed new management and hired a firm that specializes in turning around troubled companies.


ESPRIT ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE
The Esprit de Corporation, the closely held apparel manufacturer, said yesterday that David Folkman, its president and chief executive, resigned on Monday.
A successor has not yet been named.
In a statement, Mr.
Folkman said: "I came to Esprit in March 1993 with a set of specific objectives. I have accomplished what I set out to do and am pleased with the substantial progress the company has made." Esprit said it had formed an executive committee consisting of the two principal shareholders of Esprit U.S. -- Susie Tompkins, its co-founder and owner, and Michael Ying -- and Donald La Vigne, a board member, to which the three senior executives at Esprit U.S will report.


The Tenement Battle Is Over, but Not the Fight
Hours after a band of squatters and their sympathizers briefly seized control of a city-owned tenement, both they and the police officials who successfully removed them early yesterday morning vowed yesterday that they would not back down in their struggle over the building.
The squatters and their allies took control of the building at 541 East 13th Street about 10 P.M.
Tuesday amid the glare and noise of the Fourth of July fireworks.


Pepperidge Farm Chooses Saatchi
The Pepperidge Farm unit of the Campbell Soup Company in Norwalk, Conn., said yesterday that it had selected Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising in New York to handle its North American account, with billings estimated at $10 million to $15 million.
For the last 40 years, the account had been at Ogilvy &amp; Mather New York, a unit of the WPP Group, until the agency resigned it last month because of a conflict with another client, the Van Den Bergh Foods Company.


Let's Not Throw Out the Good School Boards With the Bad
To the Editor:
The solutions of Edward F. Stancik and Sandra Feldman to fraud in New York City school board elections and corruption on community school boards (Op-Ed, June 28) will likely achieve change, but not their laudable objectives.


Health Care for Consumers Advances in Albany
To the Editor:
There is only one managed care bill considered by the New York State Legislature in its final hours that meets the needs of people with disabilities and chronic illnesses.
That is the "Health Care Bill of Rights," which you misleadingly characterize in "Two Fixable Bills on H.M.O's" (editorial, June 28) as physician-backed legislation, designed to cripple health maintenance organizations and deprive them of control on hiring and firing.


McGraw-Hill Says It Has Settled With a Reseller of Used Books
McGraw-Hill said yesterday that it had reached a settlement with the Nebraska Book Company, a unit of Lincoln Industries, one of 20 companies it had accused of illegally diverting textbooks.
In a lawsuit, McGraw-Hill contended that the companies had illegally diverted or planned to resell $20 million worth of college and professional texts.
The books -- outdated editions, faulty copies and extra stock -- were meant to be shredded or recycled.
An amended version of the suit was filed last month in Federal District Court in Newark.


Defense Challenges F.B.I. Over Bomb Plot Informer
Closely questioning F.B.I. agents about their control over their chief informer, lawyers for Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and 10 other men began presenting their case yesterday, arguing that the defendants had been framed as participants in terror bombing plots.
They called as their first witnesses Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who had dealt with the informer, Emad Salem, a former Egyptian military officer who had infiltrated Mr.
Abdel Rahman's circle.
The defense is seeking to portray Mr.
Salem as having been so loosely supervised by the F.B.I. agents who worked with him that he was able to plant or create evidence to incriminate the defendants and destroy or doctor evidence that could exonerate them.


NEW JERSEY SENDS TEAM TO MANAGE NEWARK SCHOOLS
The New Jersey Board of Education ruled today that the Newark school system, the largest in the state, had failed to give its students a minimum education for decades and would be taken over by a state-supervised management team headed by a top educator from the New York City schools.
But a state judge ordered the takeover halted for at least a day while he weighed an appeal by lawyers for the city's Board of Education.


Key's Surgery Called Success
While the Yankees will not know for months whether Jimmy Key will ever be able to pitch for them again, they described the surgery he had today to repair a torn rotator cuff in his left shoulder as successful.
Dr.
James Andrews performed Key's surgery in Birmingham, Ala., but the Yankees declined to provide details about the operation.
Although the Yankees claimed Key had a "small tear," they refused to reveal its length or discuss Andrews's procedures.


Regulator Accused of Improprieties
A regulator with the State Public Service Commission improperly accepted three golf outings and meals from an executive at Orange and Rockland Utilities, the New York State Ethics Commission charged today.
The charge was the latest allegation of impropriety involving the utility, which has been mired in scandal after its chief executive and several top officers were charged two years ago with illegally using the utility's money for political contributions and personal expenses.
The money used for the golf outings was part of the more than $3 million in questionable spending that an outside investigator documented last summer, a utility spokesman said.

Belfast Catholics Loyal to I.R.A. Say It Stirred Up Street Violence
Residents of the Roman Catholic section of West Belfast said on Wednesday that the Irish Republican Army and its political wing, Sinn Fein, had been stirring up the violence that has raged in the streets of Belfast for the last two nights.
The residents, who asked for anonymity because they feared reprisal, said that they saw members of the overwhelmingly Catholic I.R.A. and Sinn Fein recruiting young men, many of them teen-agers, for the violence that some fear could endanger the official effort to bring peace to the British province.


Corrections
The Vows column in the Styles pages on Sunday, about a wedding on June 24 in the Convent Avenue Baptist Church in Harlem that evoked African village traditions, misspelled the given name of the bride.
She is Cheree Nicole Rumley, not Sheree.


American Sprinters Race Past Top Fields
The men's 100-meter race was under way, and the world's fastest human was sitting in the stands and dividing his attention.
In front of Leroy Burrell was the finish line of the race in which he set the world record of 9.85 seconds last year.
In Burrell's lap was his baby son, who was finishing a bottle of milk.
"It's going to be Marsh," Burrell said.


Witness Links Stolen Firearms To Army Friend of McVeigh
A witness scheduled to appear before the grand jury hearing evidence in the bombing of the Federal Building here says that an old Army buddy of the two main suspects tried to make him an unwitting accomplice in disposing of loot from a robbery.
The witness, James Rosencrans, came to the attention of Federal investigators when they discovered that he had recently pawned a rifle that had been stolen in a robbery to which one of the suspects, Terry L. Nichols, had been tied earlier.


Stock Trading Is Brisk as Dow Hits 4,615.23, Rising 30.08
The Dow Jones industrial average burst through 4,600 yesterday for the first time, leading the stock market to a banner day.
Stocks rallied even as the outlook for interest rates remained uncertain.
There was no announcement yesterday after the first day of a two-day meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers on interest-rate policy.
Still, the Dow continued its seven-month rally and set a record for the 41st time in 1995.
The broader Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks and the Nasdaq composite index also ended the session on the up side.


Foster Furcolo, 83, Governor, Legislator and Sometime Writer
Foster Furcolo, whose two two-year terms as Governor of Massachusetts highlighted a lifetime in politics, public service, legal practice, teaching and literary endeavors, died yesterday at Youville Hospital in his hometown, Cambridge, Mass.
He was 83.
Death was due to heart failure, his son Charles said.


Rookie Earns Ticket To Ride Right on Back to Columbus
There was an Elvis impersonator, four mop-topped musicians singing Beatles songs and a red-headed kid answering to the name of Opie.
The White Sox had a "Turn Back the Clock to 1964" promotion so the night was filled with imitators and nostalgia.
Brian Boehringer contributed to the theme with a lousy impersonation of a major league pitcher.
Boehringer made certain the largest crowd of the season at Comiskey Park would revel in what transpired on the field by seriously struggling to throw strikes.
The 25-year-old rookie walked the first four batters of the game, then allowed John Kruk's grand slam to help the White Sox build a huge cushion and coast to an 11-5 victory over the Yankees before 42,961 spectators.

Pirate Homers Add to the Phillies' Woes
Pirates 7, Phillies 4
The Pittsburgh Pirates scored five runs on homers in the eighth inning and sent the visiting Philadelphia Phillies to their fifth straight loss last night.
Dave Clark hit a three-run pinch-homer and Al Martin followed with a two-run shot off Ricky Bottalico, who failed to hold a 3-2 lead.
The Phillies, who got another good pitching performance from the rookie Tyler Green, lost for the eighth time in nine games.
They have been shut out in 68 of their last 74 innings.


Neumann Received Threats
LISELOTTE NEUMANN, the second-ranked Ladies Professional Golf Association golfer last year, has received threats and played a one-day tournament this week under guard, a published report said yesterday.
Neumann, 29, was accompanied by police guards as she won the tournament at the Viberga course south of Stockholm on Tuesday.
Two officers were assigned to protect her.


About 500 Workers Are Hired For New Force at Javits Center
Officials at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center said yesterday that they had hired about 500 employees over the weekend for a new permanent work force whose creation is intended to break the grip of organized crime on the center.
The workers were chosen from a pool of more than 2,700 applicants who lined up around the center on Friday and Saturday, some seeking to keep coveted union jobs they had held for years and others without union cards hoping for a chance to work at the center for the first time.


I.R.S. Inquiry: Is Worker At I.B.M. Really A Contractor?
The Internal Revenue Service is auditing I.B.M. to determine if it improperly paid thousands of workers as independent contractors instead of employees.
Income and Social Security taxes must be withheld from employees' paychecks, but not from payments to independent contractors.
An I.B.M. spokesman said it regarded the inquiry, which covers the years 1986 through 1992, as routine.
"We are cooperating fully with the I.R.S.," the spokesman, Rob Wilson, said.


Becker Barely Survives, but It's a Day for Favorites
The man says he was born at Wimbledon when he surfaced as this Grand Slam's 17-year-old champion 10 years ago, but he now confesses to being in the sunset of his career.
Today, Boris Becker played almost until the sun went down -- and in England at this time of year, sundown takes forever.
So did this match.


Packard Bell Selling NEC A Big Stake
Linking the leading personal computer vendors in the United States and Japan, the NEC Corporation said today that it had agreed to buy nearly 20 percent of Packard Bell Electronics Inc. for $170 million.
The relationship gives a crucial financial infusion to Packard Bell, which is privately held.
The Sacramento, Calif., company has surged to the lead of the American personal computer market largely by selling machines through mass merchants like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, but has grown at a pace that would be hard to sustain without outside investors.


Market Place; Dollar General has been giving investors a bang for their buck.
IF it ain't broke, don't fix it is just how the management of the Dollar General Corporation is proceeding as it continues to open more small, low-price stores, focusing on small-town America.
Wall Street apparently likes what it sees, with many security analysts rating the company, which transferred to the New York Stock Exchange in February, as a buy.
The stock has been moving upward recently, notching a number of new highs.


Just Close the Bases
President Clinton should resist the temptation to intervene in the politically painful business of closing unneeded military bases.
His efforts can only undermine the independent base-closing commission that Congress established to prevent politics from paralyzing a process that can save the country billions of dollars while streamlining American defenses.
The White House has gotten involved because the commission's latest recommendations call for closing two bases in California, a state Mr.
Clinton cannot afford to lose in next year's election.
To ease the pain of closing, the White House and Pentagon have proposed a plan that could save some of the 11,000 jobs at McClellan Air Force Base, near Sacramento.
It would leave the Pentagon the option of privatizing the maintenance work in California instead of transferring it to an Army base in Pennsylvania, as the commission proposed.


Lining Up for Aid in Chechnya


Woman Is Charged in Forgery
An Atlantic City woman who was charged in April with endangering the welfare of a child and forging signatures to secure a job as a lifeguard is in trouble again.
Nicyce A. Smith was arrested yesterday and charged with forging a doctor's signature so that she could work at the Greenbriar Health Care Facility.
The deception was uncovered in a week and she was dismissed, the authorities said.
The earlier charges are pending.


Yugoslavia Deports Refugee Serbs to Fight for Rebels in Bosnia and Croatia
In the center of Belgrade this afternoon, several dozen women in black dresses held a silent protest against a new Government policy under which their sons and husbands have been arrested and sent to fight in Serbian armies in Bosnia and Croatia.
The women carried signs reading "No Forced Mobilization" and "Desertion Is an Alternative to War."


Stolt Comex Seaway S.A.  (SCSWF,NNM) reports earnings for Qtr to May 31


Mr. Major Wins, for Now
Britain's Prime Minister, John Major, usually casts himself as a benign compromiser, straddling the unthreatening middle ground of an ideologically divided Conservative Party.
But two weeks ago he deliberately forced the fight of his political life, and on Tuesday he won it cleanly.
Directly challenging his party's vociferous anti-European Union minority, Mr.
Major won the votes of two-thirds of the Conservative members of Parliament to renew his mandate as party leader, and thus Prime Minister.
His only declared challenger, John Redwood, got most of the rest.


Out of South Africa, Progress
At the turn of the century, Cecil Rhodes, one of this country's early statesmen-tycoons, dreamed of building a railroad from Cape Town to Cairo.
He never realized his vision.
Succeeding where Rhodes fell short, a South African entrepreneur, Hans Harwinkels, is linking the far corners of the continent with microwave signals instead of steel.
In little more than two years, he has built a pay-for-view satellite-television empire whose programming is beamed from South Africa to Egypt and 40 countries in between.


Criminal-Records Plan Is Fought
The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey filed formal comments yesterday opposing a state police plan to make all criminal records, including arrests that did not lead to conviction, readily accessible to the public for a $5 fee.
The A.C.L.U. said such disclosure could unfairly taint people, because the fact that an arrest does not result in conviction is often not reflected in the records.
But Chuck Davis, a spokesman for the State Attorney General's office, said nearly all the information to be provided under the policy change is already available at courthouses and police stations.


Hotel Workers' Union Approves 6-Year Contract With Pay Raise
Jubilant hotel workers approved a new six-year contract yesterday, all but ending a labor battle that nearly caused the first hotel strike in New York City in 10 years.
The contract, including a wage increase, an improved pension plan and the promise that independent businesses operating within hotels must adhere to the union agreement's terms, must now be voted on by the board of directors of the Hotel Association of New York City, representing the owners of 79 hotels.
The board is to meet this afternoon, and if it approves the contract as expected, the agreement will take effect immediately, retroactive to Saturday.

As Affirmative Action Ebbs, A Sense of Uncertainty Rises
Eddie Graham senses changes in the air, and he is angry and disillusioned.
"A lot of blacks have gotten to where they are because of affirmative action," said Mr.
Graham, a 37-year-old black lawyer, as he stood on a street corner in Philadelphia last week.
"For them to say now it's time to end it, that's really a disservice to our younger generation that's coming along."


Mets Mount a Rally For Rare Shea Victory
It took a gutsy move by the manager, a key out from the closer, a freakish play followed by a gorgeous slide by the leadoff hitter and a clutch two-out single in the bottom of the ninth from the cleanup man.
But, as the Mets were saying almost in unison last night, something had to go right for them at some point.
Bobby Bonilla's single on the first pitch he saw from left-handed reliever Bryan Hickerson drove in Brett Butler and gave the Mets a wild 5-4 victory over the Cubs at Shea Stadium last night, just their second victory in their last 10 games at home.


A Meal, a Deadly Potion, a Major Legal Test
The couple dined on their traditional celebration meal, kosher chicken and wine.
Then, George Delury said yesterday, he diluted the pills in water and added some honey to sweeten the foul mixture.
He poured the concoction into two cups and brought them, with a straw, to Myrna Lebov, his wife of 22 years.
Her wrists were nearly useless from the multiple sclerosis that had stolen her strength and memory, but, reclining in bed in a colorful T-shirt, she managed to hold the cup with one hand.

U.S. Warns Thais on Naming Cabinet Members Linked to Drugs
The United States and Thailand appeared to be on a diplomatic collision course today over the possibility of Cabinet posts for Thai politicians linked by the United States Government to drug trafficking.
The United States has warned that relations with Thailand, one of its closest allies in Southeast Asia, could be strained if drug-tainted politicians are named to the Cabinet being formed by the Chart Thai, or Thai Nation, political party, which won national elections on Sunday.

Players Have Different Views From Bench
Patrick Ewing and Charles Smith shared a bench yesterday.
This was not at Madison Square Garden but in a hearing room at the New York office of the National Labor Relations Board.
Ewing and Smith, Knick teammates, were separated by only one person, but they were much farther apart in their positions in the civil war that brought them and three teams of lawyers together.
Larry Singer, the hearing officer, conducted the hearing so that Daniel Silverman, the regional director, can determine if the board should hold an election on the effort by a large group of players to decertify the union that represents National Basketball Association players.


Major's Cabinet: Right and Left Rewarded
Riding on his re-election on Tuesday as the Conservative Party leader, Prime Minister John Major shuffled his Cabinet this afternoon, passing out plum positions to loyalists of both the Tory right and the Tory left and rewarding two would-be rivals who did not challenge him.
The post of Foreign Secretary, which is critical as Britain tries to hammer out its policies on European integration and on Bosnia, went to Malcolm Rifkind, who had backed Mr.
Major and had been effective as an articulate and cost-cutting Defense Secretary.

Chiron Files Plan With F.D.A. for Implant to Deliver Drug Into Eye
The Chiron Corporation said today that it had filed an application with the Food and Drug Administration to market an implant that would deliver the antiviral drug ganciclovir directly to the eye in patients with CMV retinitis.
CMV retinitis is the most common infection and leading cause of blindness in people with AIDS.
Patients with CMV retinitis are now treated with intravenous ganciclovir, or foscarnet, another antiviral drug, but the therapy commonly requires one or more shots a day.
The Chiron implant would deliver the drug for up to six months, reducing cost, while slowing progression of the disease relative to the intravenous injection.
Chiron has not specified a price for the implant, which it calls Vitrasert.


Administration Tries to Blunt Hearing on Raid on Texas Sect
Trying to blunt a potentially embarrassing inquiry, members of the Clinton Administration and some of its supporters in Congress are warning that scheduled Congressional hearings on the Government raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., might undermine Federal firearms laws and shore up support for paramilitary groups.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in a letter today that he was "worried that investigating events at Waco, without investigating the extreme activities of some militias, seems to suggest that law-enforcement agencies are the real threat to the safety of American citizens." Mr.
Rubin oversees the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which conducted the initial assault on the compound in 1993.

New Coach Emphasizes Break With Isles' Past
By hiring Mike Milbury as their new head coach, as the Islanders formally announced at a news conference here this morning, the once-proud franchise did more than secure a long-term commitment from perhaps the best available candidate for the job.
They also openly moved to make a break from their past by going outside the organization to fill the position, all the while stating the goal of reattaining past glories in the near future.


NEW JERSEY SENDS TEAM TO MANAGE NEWARK SCHOOLS

But a state judge ordered the takeover halted for at least a day while he weighed an appeal by lawyers for the city's Board of Education.

Abroad at Home; Mr. Clinton's Betrayal
For Bill Clinton's natural supporters, the most painful realization of his Presidency is that he is a man without a bottom line.
He may abandon any seeming belief, any principle.
You cannot rely on him.
There is a telling example to hand.
As the Senate debated a counterterrorism bill last month, Mr.
Clinton changed his position on the power of Federal courts to issue writs of habeas corpus.
The Senate then approved a provision that may effectively eliminate that power.

GOLF Watson Takes Lead
Tom Watson, a nonwinner on the PGA Tour since 1987, returned to the event that produced his first tour victory in 1974 and took the first-round lead yesterday at the Western Open in Lamont, Ill.
Despite steady winds with gusts in excess of 30 miles an hour, the 45-year-old Watson shot a four-under-par 68.
He birdied four of the final six holes and shot 32 on the back nine to take a one-stroke lead over Ed Fiori, Jay Haas, Brett Ogle, Joel Edwards and Steve Lowery.
Edwards had a hole-in-one on the 172-yard 14th hole.
The only amateur in the field, 19-year-old Tiger Woods, shot a 74. (AP) NO-NAME LEADS BIG NAMES: Sven Struver of Germany, who has never won on the PGA European tour, outplayed all the big names as he fired a seven-under-par 65 in the opening round of the Irish Open yesterday in Kilkenny and took a two-stroke lead over Roger Chapman of Britain and the Australian Robert Allenby.

Even if they can't sign Todd Bertuzzi, their first-round choice of two years ago, they will get an extra second-round pick as compensation if he goes back into the eligibility pool.


Clinton Urges 'Less Combat' By Politicians
Drawing together many of his recent themes, President Clinton called on the nation's political figures today to have "more conversation and less combat" and to help Americans find some "common ground" as Republicans and Democrats debate the proper role of government.
In a wide-ranging speech, the President vigorously defended his vision of government as an agent to improve the lives of the middle class against the Republicans' call for less government.
But Mr.
Clinton also denounced "too much extremism of rhetoric and excessive partisanship" and said the way the political debate was conducted was as important to the country as its outcome.


Saidye Rosner Bronfman; Philanthropist, 98
Saidye Rosner Bronfman, a philanthropist and widow of Samuel Bronfman, founder of the Seagram Company, died yesterday at her home in Montreal.
She was 98.
At her death, she was honorary president of the Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Family Foundation, which supports a variety of charitable and community causes.
A patron of the arts, she and her husband founded the Samuel Bronfman Collection of Canadian Art.
She created a special fund for the Montreal Musem of Fine Arts to encourage young artists through the purchase of their work.


Families Are Barriers to Many Organ Donations, Study Finds
Although 10,000 of the Americans who die each year have the potential to be organ donors, only 40 percent of them actually become donors.
Conventional wisdom has held that the problem is doctors' reluctance to approach bereaved family members.
But a new study has come with another explanation.
The problem is not that doctors neglect to ask family members about the donation of organs and tissues, the study finds, but that most families refuse when they are asked.


Panel Fears Possible Flaws In Jet Engines
As many as five jet engines in commercial service on American planes, overhauled in Turkey, might be vulnerable to flaws that could cause a catastrophic accident, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration said yesterday.
An accident involving such an engine destroyed a Valujet DC-9 on a takeoff run at the Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta on June 8, they said.
Seven people were injured, including a flight attendant who suffered burns on 30 percent of her body and was hit by shrapnel from the engine.
If the plane had been in the air or had been carrying more passengers, the safety board said, "there would most likely have been numerous fatalities because of the fire and the buildup of toxic fumes in the cabin."

Unraveling of a Land Swap: No School, No Plant Expansion
Two years ago, it appeared to be the perfect civic deal: a major manufacturer in Brooklyn and the city's School Construction Authority would swap two adjacent pieces of land, allowing a long-delayed school to be built and giving the manufacturer the space it needed to expand its 700-worker plant.
And both the city and state would offer financial help.
But now, the deal -- brokered late in 1993 by former Mayor David N. Dinkins and former Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo -- is dead.
A lawsuit blocks the construction of the badly needed intermediate school in East New York.
The manufacturer, Blue Ridge Farms, is talking about moving its food-processing plant -- and the jobs -- to the South.


Chemical Aims to Expand Electronic Banking
Chemical Bank said yesterday that it would expand its electronic banking services beginning in October, including a new push into the home banking arena that it has tried unsuccessfully to develop for more than a decade.
As part of the program, the bank announced an alliance with the Microsoft Corporation to provide money management software linked to Chemical's private computer network.
Microsoft will help Chemical market the new services by providing it with names of registered users of Microsoft products in the bank's area, a spokesman for Microsoft said.


Small-Town Practice Proves Attractive for Rising Number of Lawyers
When Jeff and Cathy Helms leave their law offices here on their daily stroll to lunch at Harpers Drug Store, they pass a half-dozen clients whose wills they wrote and, on occasion, a logger for whom they won a workman's compensation claim.
At Harpers they eat next to people whose timber leases, real estate closings and personal injury cases they have handled.
Passing through the store are the proud parents of students on the Clinch County High School mock trial team, which the couple coached to a regional championship this year.


Places To Dine Out Under the Sky
PEOPLE who have never participated in the ultimate urban experience often have a hard time understanding why people in Manhattan revere nature.
When you are surrounded by nothing but the relentless gray of concrete and the cold glare of glass, each flower becomes an occasion for celebration.
Many of us spend the cold months dreaming about the warm ones.
When spring finally arrives, we make pilgrimages to smell the lilacs in Central Park, and summer finds us spreading blankets in unlikely places so we can worship the sun.
We nurture each pathetic tree that struggles upward to spread a bit of shade across a sidewalk.
Is it any wonder that every restaurant with a square foot of outdoor space instantly fills it with a table?
You already know about Barbetta, the Tavern on the Green, Provence and the Sea Grill, to name just a few famous outdoor eating spots.
But just when it seemed that no garden had gone undiscovered, some ingenious restaurateurs unearthed a few more.
They reclaimed derelict parks and created farms out of what once was paved.
Some found unused courtyards; others went up on the roof.
These gardens, listed loosely in the order of preference, have all opened in Manhattan within the last year or two.
They are large and small, high and low, and they offer every conceivable sort of food.
But each has made summer in the city just a little bit better.


New Indictment for Reputed Colombo Crime Family Captain
The life of Gregory Scarpa Jr. reads like the script of a gangster soap opera.
The latest episode unfolded yesterday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, where Mr.
Scarpa -- whom the authorities call a mobster, the son of a mobster and the nephew of a mobster -- pleaded not guilty to 13 charges including murder, racketeering, drug trafficking, extortion and gambling.
Mr.
Scarpa, 43, who is already serving 20 years for racketeering, has been accused by Federal prosecutors of being a Colombo captain and the leader of a crew of 13 members of the crime family since 1980.
The crew has been accused of 15 murders, including two assassinations that took place during an internal war for control of the Colombo family in 1991, in addition to charges that it maintained a routine of drug-running, extortion and gambling.


Major's Scorecard
By coming out on top in his calculated gamble of submitting to a Conservative leadership contest, John Major has virtually guaranteed that he will stay on as Prime Minister and lead the Tories into the next general election sometime between now and the spring of 1997.
But he accomplished nothing that would help him win that election.
Quite the contrary: the last two weeks demonstrated that the Conservative Party is riven into two hostile camps, that it is obsessed with an issue that everyday people do not care much about, and that Mr.
Major has persevered at the helm not because he is an inspirational captain but because he is, as one of his own ministers put it during Tuesday's vote, "the least worst option."


2 Killed and 2 Wounded in Club Shootout
Two men were killed and two others seriously wounded early yesterday in a wild shootout at a social club in Elmhurst, Queens, the police said.
The police found the bodies of the two dead men at 5:30 A.M. at a curb in front of Evocacion Club, at 38-02 34th Street, an after-hours club that caters to Colombians, said Lieut.
James Maguire, commander of the 114th Precinct Detective Squad.
Police officials said that they had no idea of a motive in the shootings and no charges have been filed.


Aziz Nesin of Turkey Dies at 80; Writer Escaped Militants' Arson
Aziz Nesin, an iconoclastic Turkish writer who narrowly escaped death in a 1993 fire set by militant Muslims he had angered, died yesterday while visiting Cesme, a town on Turkey's Aegean coast.
He was 80 and had a home in Istanbul.
The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.

Inside Art
Art for Profit
Buying art purely as an investment is an idea commonly frowned upon in the art world today.
But 21 years ago, when the British Rail Pension Fund decided to invest 2.9 percent of its assets in Impressionist and Old Master paintings, Old Master drawings, Chinese and European works of art and antiquities, it was a downright scandal.
It was considered outrageous that railroad workers' money was being invested in something as elitist as art, and Sotheby's, the pension fund's adviser, was thought to have a conflict of interest because most of the art was bought at auction.


This Time, the Fed Trails the Market
The bankers who set loan and deposit rates and the investors who buy and sell Treasury bonds apparently concluded months ago that the risk of an overheated economy was fading and higher interest rates were no longer needed to protect them against inflation.
The Federal Reserve waited until yesterday to ratify that thinking with its first cut in the Federal funds rate after a yearlong series of increases.
Many rates that directly affect consumers had already fallen in anticipation of the move, and analysts say long-term rates are not likely to fall further soon, though short-term rates may drop.

Two-thirds of the way through the Special Olympics World Games, the public's on-again, off-again love affair with this nine-day, 140-nation extravaganza for mentally retarded athletes seems to be on again.
At least 60,000 people attended Saturday's celebrity-laden opening ceremony at the Yale Bowl.
Attendance quickly tailed off for the 19 sports at 25 sites, with crowds often consisting mostly of athletes' families.
The organizers estimated there were 400,000 spectators for the first four days, but they included 150,000 visitors to tall ships in the New Haven harbor and 50,000 at a Fourth of July fireworks exhibition.

About the regular-season weekly format that begins next week, in which viewers see the same local game they would normally get, he said: "You don't see a national game. To me, I don't see the plus or minus to that."


Man Charged in D.W.I. Deaths
State police have determined that Kevin R. Price, 24, of Basking Ridge was drunk when he slammed head-on into a van while driving the wrong way on the Garden State Parkway earlier this week, killing four people.


Home Video
This summer the big titles are in movie theaters, not video stores, but there are always discoveries to be made on tape.
For example, Shanachie Entertainment recently released "Out of Ireland," Paul Wagner's documentary about the Irish migration to the United States.
Shown on PBS a month ago, the tape has mainline credentials, but it also leads to an eclectic trove of lesser-known videos from a small distributor with varying interests.
Shanachie is primarily a recording company, but its video catalogue, which currently lists only one feature film ("Vampire Vixens From Venus"), is growing in several directions.
Sherwin Dunner, the video acquisitions director, said Shanachie favors Americana and historical documentaries.
A large part of the collection consists of PBS titles like "The Kennedys," "Amelia Earhart" and Ric Burns's documentary "The Way West."


Winning Streak for Whitman
Continuing her winning streak, Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman got a second state workers' union to reach a settlement yesterday on a four-year contract that includes a two-year pay freeze and requires employees who want traditional health insurance to help pay for it, The Associated Press reported.
The agreement with the 7,000-member International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers is similar to a deal reached earlier this week with the 9,000-member American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
But the largest state workers union, the 35,000-member Communications Workers of America, said it will not agree to the same terms.

For Children
Sport Exhibition
Liberty Science Center  Liberty State Park  251 Phillip Street  Jersey City  (201) 200-1000  Recommended ages: 4 and up  Through Sept. 4
This may be your only chance to steer a bobsled at Olympic speed without experiencing psychic or physical damage.
At this self-guided exhibition, you can learn some of the biology and physics behind sports.
Sitting in a stationary bobsled on a simulated course, for example, riders learn a basic lesson in gravity as they career and careen down the ice at 60 miles per hour.
Children can also sit in stationary wheelchairs and race in place, feeling the ground's resistance and finding out which move faster, arms or legs.
Children will also relish the climbing walls; one is boulderlike, the other flat with protrusions.
Give both a try.


The Law School Cartel
White-collar professionals are sometimes accused of using professional rule-making as a mask to hide anti-competitive conspiracies.
But now the antitrust division of the Justice Department has punctured one such hypocrisy.
It settled a suit against the American Bar Association under terms that will prevent the organization from manipulating its accreditation of law schools for the purpose of jacking up faculty salaries and improving working conditions.
The A.B.A. accredits law schools to assure students and employers that the schools are meeting professional standards.
But the A.B.A. has turned its accrediting committees over to professors who have used their control to force law schools to pay high wages and provide expensive fringe benefits.
The A.B.A. refused, for example, to accredit law schools that earned profit, paid low salaries or failed to provide paid leaves for faculty.

Ambivalent Rabin Reflects Israel's Wary View of Peace
Yitzhak Rabin answers the question with a question: Should anyone be surprised that Israelis are ambivalent about their peace talks with the Palestinians?
"On one hand, rationally, they understand that the time has come to end the conflict in all its parts," the Israeli Prime Minister said.
"On the other hand, they are emotionally not convinced that the Palestinian Authority is capable or willing to cope with the terror."


Art in Review
Barry Le Va  Sonnabend Gallery 420 West Broadway (near Spring Street) SoHo Through July 28
Barry Le Va may not want the credit, but in some ways his dispersed low-lying sculptures make him one of the grandfathers of scatter art.
More important, his sculptures develop the tenets of early 1970's Post-Minimalism with a persistence and clarity that has eluded many artists of his generation.


A German court rules that images in a Benetton campaign are exploitative and illegal.
AN advertising campaign by Benetton Group S.p.A., the Italian clothing maker, that includes depictions of an oil-drenched bird, child laborers in Latin America and a human body stamped with the words "H.I.V. positive" was ruled illegal yesterday by a German appellate court.
The country's second-highest court, in the city of Karlsruhe, ruled that "anyone who exploits feelings of pity in such an intense way for commercial interests violates competition law."


Seven-Year Pact for Keady
Purdue yesterday announced that its basketball coach, GENE KEADY, has signed a new seven-year contract.
Athletic Director MORGAN J. BURKE said the agreement includes a base salary of $138,000 per year and that specific details will not be announced.
Keady has compiled a 322-142 mark in 15 years at Purdue.

In America; Bad Meat and Politics
The bacterium Escherichia coli 0157:H7 is a nightmare embedded in millions of hamburger patties.
Not everyone will become ill from eating meat tainted with E. coli 0157, but for those who do -- especially children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems -- the consequences can be catastrophic.
Bloody diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps are the usual first signs of E. coli poisoning, which can result in the failure of kidneys and other major organs, blindness, impaired motor skills, cognitive difficulties and death.
It is a problem that is growing.
E. coli poisoning is now the leading cause of acute kidney failure in American children.

This show, with the American artist David Saunders as curator, is intended to focus on Korean art as art, breaking with the pattern of recent exhibitions that have approached Asian art as an expression of ethnic identity.
Nonetheless, the viewer inevitably approaches the work with the question, "What's Korean about this?"

Scandal Over Paris Luxury Apartments Embarrasses Chirac
President Jacques Chirac and his conservative Government, not yet two months in office, are already embroiled in a widening scandal about his largesse in doling out city-owned luxury apartments to political cronies while he was Mayor of Paris for 18 years.
One of the most prominent beneficiaries was Alain Juppe, named Prime Minister by Mr.
Chirac after he was elected to the Presidency May 7.
Mr.
Juppe appeared on national television tonight to say that there was absolutely nothing improper about the way he had got his own apartment from the city in 1990.

It champions excellence in urban design, rational planning and preservation of the best of the city's past.


Higher Standards for College Sports
One of the most tantalizing but destructive dreams inner-city youths have today is the notion that they can skip their educations and become millionaires in professional sports.
The idea was reinforced in the recent professional basketball draft, in which several top prospects quit or passed on college altogether to sign lucrative contracts.
But such athletes are rare.
Fewer than one in 100,000 high school athletes win college sports scholarships.
Of those only a few ascend to the pros, and most of them will be washed up by their mid-20's.
In 1986 the N.C.A.A. sought to insure better academic success with its Proposition 48, a measure that raised eligibility standards for freshmen athletes.
To play sports as a freshman, an athlete needs a 2.0 average in a high school core curriculum and a combined score of at least 700 on the Scholastic Assessment Test, about 200 points below the national average for college-bound seniors.


CHRONICLE
Another wedding in Britain made news this week, that of CROWN PRINCE PAVLOS, 28, of Greece, and MARIE-CHANTAL MILLER, 26, an American heiress.
The bridegroom's parents are KING CONSTANTINE and QUEEN ANNE-MARIE, who live in exile in London, and the bride is the daughter of CHANTAL MILLER and ROBERT W. MILLER, a founder of Duty Free Shoppers.
Only 450 of the 1,500 invited guests could fit into the Cathedral of St.
Sophia in London for the ceremony on Saturday.
It was said to be the biggest assemblage of royalty since the marriage of Queen Elizabeth II to Prince Philip in 1947.
In September, Crown Prince Pavlos is to start a job with Charles R. Weber, a ship-brokerage firm in Greenwich, Conn.
His wife, who is to be known as Crown Princess Pavlos, will return to her art history studies at New York University.

Diner's Journal
The Diner Is the Theme
If 57th Street is going to be taken over by theme restaurants, I wish more of them could be like Brooklyn Diner U.S.A., which opened last week.
It is a sanitized fantasy of an old diner, one where the floor is always clean, your cup is always full and everyone who works in the place begins the day with be-nice pills.


Reduction's Biggest Impact: Fanning Hopes of More Cuts
The Federal Reserve's move yesterday to reduce the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, is likely to have only a minor impact on consumers, at least in the near future.
Indeed, the Fed's decision to drop short-term interest rates merely mirrored what has already happened in financial markets.
Long-term mortgage rates have already fallen almost one and a half percentage points, to 7.63 percent, since the beginning of the year, and yields on Treasury bonds have also dropped steadily.


Charges Against Rabbi Dropped
Federal prosecutors have dismissed charges against one of two rabbis from Borough Park, Brooklyn, who were accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl during a trans-Pacific flight in May, officials said yesterday.
The United States Attorney's office in Los Angeles dropped the complaint of abusive sexual misconduct against Rabbi Israel Grunwald, 44, "without prejudice" -- meaning that the investigation will continue and the charge can be refiled, according to a statement from Assistant United States Attorney Debra W. Yang.


Pitching Makes That First Inning A Doozy
Sterling Hitchock, meet Brian Boehringer.
Mr.
Boehringer, this is Mr.
Hitchcock.
Even though the two young pitchers do not need such introductions, they could have chatted for hours tonight because they had a frustrating trait in common: Both pitched so erratically during the first inning in the past two nights that the Yankees were doomed and dejected early and then defeated.
Hitchcock, a superior prospect, was not as sloppy as Boehringer was the night before in Chicago, but he was no Jimmy Key either as the Rangers rocked two monstrous homers in the first and then added one more shot in the fifth in breezing to a 5-2 victory at the Ballpark in Arlington.
A black cat skipped in and out of the dugout throughout the game and the Yankee owner, George Steinbrenner, sat beside it.
But Hitchcock could not blame bad luck or bad vibes.
Simply blame bad pitching and his futile quest for his curveball.


Law Review Masks Diversity in a New Admission System
In the competitive world of law school, where students scramble to distinguish themselves from their peers, admission to a law review is an honor that can enhance a career.
Now the editorial board of a prestigious law review has changed its selection process, making it harder to determine who is admitted on merit alone and who is selected partly on the basis of race or ethnicity.

Drawings From the Golden Age of Denmark
The Golden Age of Denmark, a brief cultural flowering that followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars and lasted until around 1850, numbered among its luminaries Hans Christian Andersen and Kirkegaard, as well as achievements in physics, ballet and theater.
In painting, the period produced a small circle of artists who developed a precise, discretely romantic art based on direct observation of everyday life and the Danish landscape.
The star of this circle was Christen Kobke, who was born in 1810, the son of a master baker, and died in 1848, producing his best work in the 1830's and early 40's.
Kobke's singularity makes the phrase Golden Age seem inflated, at least where art is concerned.
Exhibitions devoted to the period are mostly opportunities for further study of his special, quintessentially Danish genius and the context that produced it.
They also allow one to measure his surprisingly sure, clear talent against the efforts of his predecessors and contemporaries.


Balkan Force To Fight Back If Threatened
Senior United Nations military officers said today that a new rapid reaction force in Bosnia would operate forcefully and streamline its command structure to avoid excessive interference by civilian officials.
The military's statement came as the French and British Governments indicated that they wanted the new 12,500-member force to respond aggressively to threats to the safety of peacekeepers or of aid convoys, particularly in the Sarajevo region, where the plight of civilians is now extreme.


Retailers Report Their Sales Were Sluggish Last Month
Spending at the nation's retail chain stores was sluggish during June, sales figures released yesterday show.
Analysts said the lackluster results were consistent with a slowdown in the economy.
Big department stores and discount chains registered the biggest sales gains, as consumers continued to be spend cautiously, gravitating to stores offering markdowns on summer merchandise.

Sports of The Times; Nelson Comes Off The Rack
THE Knicks could have conducted their three-week search for a new coach through every high-fashion men's shop in the world, and they couldn't have come up with a better choice of goods than Don Nelson.
While he may be a little shiny around the elbows, he has worn well, and has come through some bad weather.
To dispense with the sartorial first: Don Nelson is best known for the clunky black sneakers he once wore as a coach on the sidelines.
Guccis, as it happens in this case, are for a certain predecessor.


Angry Chrysler Board Prevents Iacocca From Using Stock Options
The old saying "you can't take it with you" has a painful new meaning for Lee A. Iacocca, one that could cost the former chairman and chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation almost $32 million.
Chrysler's board, angered at his alliance with Kirk Kerkorian's attempt to take over the auto maker, has refused to allow Mr.
Iacocca to exercise stock options he received after retiring from Chrysler in 1992, the company said in a document filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


U.S. TO ESTABLISH FULL HANOI LINKS, TOP OFFICIALS SAY
Twenty years after the war in Vietnam ended, President Clinton has concluded that the time has come to establish full diplomatic relations with the former enemy and may announce the decision as early as next week, senior Administration officials said today.
The President has not yet signed a formal order granting Vietnam full diplomatic recognition, which would be the United States' most important step towards burying the bitterness of the Vietnam War.
But Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser, is completing a draft order recommending the policy change, which is expected to be presented to the President within the next few days.


Nelson Takes Blame for Webber Rift
Don Nelson remains convinced that the best days between him and Chris Webber were ahead of them, but he also knows he made some grave mistakes that not only cost him the respect of the Golden State Warriors' prized rookie but, ultimately, his job.
Speaking candidly for the first time about the power struggle between himself and the complex young superstar from the University of Michigan, Nelson blamed himself for the falling out between the two that eventually led to Webber's trade to Washington, the loss of the Warriors' morale and his forced resignation from Golden State during the All-Star Game break in February.
"It was a complicated thing, no question," Nelson said after being introduced as the Knicks' coach yesterday at Madison Square Garden.
"As I look back, I'm going to take the blame for that because I was the adult in that situation."
Webber exercised a year-out option clause in his contract partly because he grew tired of Nelson's incessant criticism.
Nelson, who acquired Webber in a draft-day deal with Orlando for the rights to Anfernee Hardaway, merely saw him as any other first-year player: a great talent with a young mind in need of fine-tuning and discipline.
The trouble began as soon as the 1993-94 season began, with Webber refusing the unglamorous chores of a big man underneath the boards.
Nelson told several backcourt players that Webber was costing the team games and once that got back to Webber from the reserve swingman Jeff Grayer, the rift widened into a chasm.
Nelson blew up during a timeout at Charlotte Coliseum in February 1994 after Webber threw a pass away.
Webber retaliated, screaming: "Treat me like a man! Treat me like a man!"
Nelson tried to talk Webber into a one-on-one meeting to apologize and clear the air, but it never materialized.
"I should have communicated with Chris more during the summer, when he was in negotiations with our team," Nelson said.
"He probably needed that closeness to me. I was the head coach in the World Games and I was pretty busy in Toronto. I should have made time for him, and I didn't. I thought we were going to get together at my basketball camp and everything would have been smoothed over. And I should have stayed closer to the situation.
"Hopefully, we can leave that behind us now because we both have to go on. I learn as I go. I'm only 55. I learn every day. And I learned a big lesson there."
The Webber incident was the first to taint Nelson's reputation as a players' coach in his 18 seasons in the job.
That reputation was built on Nelson working rookies and young players harder than most.
Sarunas Marciulionis, the Lithuanian who came to America, said that Nelson "worked me like a dog, but I became a better player because of it."
In general, Nelson has been revered by most of his former players.
"I've never had a problem with loving my players even if they didn't love me in return," Nelson said.
"I've never disliked Chris. I like him very much. He doesn't like me very much, but I do like him.
"I still believe, in the bottom of my heart, that he would have loved playing for me. If I had him over time, more than one year, we would've been the best of friends."


China to Keep Coast Areas' Special Status
After months of rumors and speculation, Shanghai's Mayor made an announcement today that amounts to a vote to keep promises to foreign investors and not to yield to demands for equality from investment-starved inland areas.
Mayor Xu Kuangdi, smiling broadly as he addressed a room full of reporters, said that after long political debate in Beijing, China's leaders had decided not to revoke the preferential tax status given to East Shanghai, one of China's fastest-growing development zones and a barometer of the nation's efforts to modernize industry.

Player Suspended for Betting
The University of Maryland has declared at least one football player ineligible for gambling on college sporting events, but the school has submitted an appeal to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, DEBBIE YOW, the school's athletic director, said yesterday.
Yow would not disclose any names, and would not say how many football players were involved.
But a source said the school's lengthy in-house inquiry into student-athlete gambling was started March 6 because of allegations that the starting quarterback, SCOTT MILANOVICH, placed bets on college basketball games.


U.S. Envoys Press the I.R.A. To Take Steps to Yield Arms
The United States Ambassadors to Britain and Ireland have reminded Gerry Adams, leader of the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, that the Clinton Administration wants him to advance the Northern Ireland peace effort.
The Administration is particularly interested, the Ambassadors say, in the area of decommissioning of arms by the I.R.A., in order to enhance the possibility of convening full-fledged peace negotiations.

An Oasis Appears On Dyckman Street; A 'Boat Bum' Who Reads the Fine Print Is Building a Pier and Marina in Inwood
Music echoed from loudspeakers as two men unfurled six green Heineken umbrellas over tables at a waterside snack bar.
A menu offered fried shrimp and calamari.
On a concrete pier, four anglers watched lines for the twitch of a nibbling bass.
Beneath them, waves washed at a sandy beach.
Two dozen boats bobbed at a dock and a line of moorings.
The sounds and sights were Newport, but this was the dead end of Dyckman Street in Inwood, a stretch of the Hudson River shore in upper Manhattan that until this spring was little more than a glass-littered cul-de-sac frequented by cabbies on lunch breaks and people dumping trash.


F.C.C. Joining A Move to Curb Violence on TV
Federal regulators and members of Congress say they hope to clamp down on broadcast violence and require more programming for children by taking advantage of a recent Federal appeals court decision that upheld restrictions on indecent programs on television and radio.
"Clearly, a record can be made that violent content on television is more dangerous to children than indecency," Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said today.

At a Spa, Six Moms on an Escapade
WE were six moms on the loose, pulling up to the Norwich Inn and Spa in (what else) a station wagon.

All of us were facing 40. We'd face it better with a facial.


Overkill in Revising Regulation
Senator Bob Dole's bill to reform regulatory procedures would erect needless obstacles to adopting Federal health, safety and environmental rules.
Its excessive provisions invite filibuster by angry Democrats and a Presidential veto.
The majority leader could exercise better leadership by joining forces with John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, whose alternative bill would bring common sense to Federal rules, not extinguish them.
Both Mr.
Dole and Mr.
Glenn start off right by requiring Federal agencies to weigh benefits against costs to weed out regulations that do more harm than good.
The calculations are necessarily inexact, especially where non-quantifiable benefits, like the value of clean air over the Grand Canyon, are involved.
But forcing agencies to explain the pros and cons of rules and justify their wisdom gives the public vital information.

International Briefs; Italian Designers Reportedly Indicted
The toast of Italian fashion -- Giorgio Armani, GianFranco Ferre, Santo Versace, Gerolamo Etro and Krizia -- and other leading designers have been indicted for reportedly bribing tax inspectors, news agencies in Milan reported yesterday.

Insecurity on the Job Will Change Our Politics
To the Editor:
"In New Work World, Employers Call All the Shots," your report on the end of the era of job security and rising wages, deserved the July 3 front-page place you gave it, not because it is news -- it is not -- but because it can help hasten the demise of illusions that do not die easily.
Eroding expectations and shrinking opportunities will sooner or later transform people's views of the country and the ability of those who lead -- and those who propose to lead -- to provide answers that make sense.
A new politics is waiting to be born.


A Defeat in D.M.V. Fight
An employees' union effort to block the conversion on Saturday of state motor vehicle offices to a private operation failed yesterday when the New Jersey Supreme Court refused to hear the case.
The setback does not mean the Communications Workers of America local representing 330 D.M.V. workers will not have its day in court.
The union had tried to bypass the Appellate Division of Superior Court after a trial court judge upheld the Whitman administration's decision to award privatization contracts without bidding.


White House Draws the Ire Of Base Panel
Only 800 jobs, and not the thousands cited by some Clinton Administration officials, are at issue in one Pentagon proposal on how the White House could respond to an independent commission's recommendation that an Air Force base in California be closed, members and aides of the commission said today.
The reason, they said, is that the commission's recommendation already gives the Defense Department the authority to keep in California more than 10,000 of the 11,000 jobs now at the post, McClellan Air Force Base near Sacramento, by awarding work done there to private companies within the state.
So no intervention by President Clinton is needed to save those jobs, said members of the independent panel, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.


Restaurants
The first time I went to Parioli Romanissimo, I was horrified: the prices seemed outrageous.
But that was three years ago, and while the restaurant's prices have not changed, my outlook has.
In the interim, I've moved to New York and discovered exactly what you pay for when you buy a rack of lamb for $35.50.
Space and quiet and discreet service; Parioli Romanissimo is one of New York City's most civilized restaurants.
The small, subdued dining room occupies the ground floor of a gracious town house, and from the moment you walk in, the staff tries to make you feel as if you are dining in a private home.
The captains play the role of butler; they are thoughtful, retiring, unopinionated and if there do happen to be some other people in the room, well, they'd just as soon you overlooked it.

Bay Gets Special Protection
Barnegat Bay in Ocean County is getting federal protection against pollution.
The Federal Environmental Protection Agency added the bay yesterday to a national list of more than 20 estuaries granted special protection.
The designation makes New Jersey eligible to receive up to $1.5 million in Federal funds over three years to develop a plan to protect the bay.
An estuary is a coastal area where fresh water from rivers and streams mixes with salt water from the ocean.

Novel Way to Unwind: Picnics by the Parkway
ON days when the air in her Bronx apartment hangs thick and dull, Tiny Timpanaro likes to take her two boys to the grassy shoulder of the Palisades Parkway.
She loads her "Mami," an '84 Corolla hatchback, with a Styrofoam cooler, a portable stereo and a big blue comforter, and she and the boys make a beeline for a spot beside two huge trees near Exit 16.


FIRST CUT SINCE '92
Under mounting political and economic pressure to stave off a possible recession, the Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates today for the first time since 1992.
But the Federal Reserve's top rate-setting committee made only a small reduction, reflecting its confidence that any downturn would be brief and mild.
It trimmed the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 5.75 percent from 6 percent.
The less critical discount rate, which the Federal Reserve levies on banks for short-term loans, was left unchanged at 5.25 percent.

When the Rwanda Hutu embarked on their killing frenzy in April 1994, tens of thousands of Tutsi sought shelter in Roman Catholic churches.
Many men and women of the cloth risked their lives to protect the refugees, and often lost their lives when Hutu militia ignored the sanctity of the temple.
But now a darker side of the story is emerging.
More than a score of priests and nuns have been accused by witnesses of complicity in atrocities, including one priest, the Rev.
Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, who has been performing his pastoral duties in France for nearly a year.


Court Shuns An Appeal On Schools
The state government moved one step closer to gaining direct control of the troubled Newark school system today after an appeals court refused to block the takeover.
But the legal skirmishing is not over.
The case now moves to the seven-judge New Jersey Supreme Court, which gave lawyers for the Newark Board of Education until 1 P.M. on Friday to file their request for a stay in the takeover.
Supreme Court members said today they would add the issue to their regular agenda next Wednesday.


E. Claiborne Robins, 84, Dies; Executive and Philanthropist
E.
Claiborne Robins, a philanthropist who built and lost one of the country's largest pharmaceutical companies, died yesterday at his home in Richmond.
He was 84.
The cause was cancer of the pancreas, said Randy Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the University of Richmond, where Mr.
Robins had been a trustee or trustee emeritus since 1951.


Also of Note
Critics' choices of some other Manhattan art shows: BRYAN HUNT, Gagosian Gallery, 136 Wooster Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo (through July 14).
Bryan Hunt has suddenly decided to go for Baroque, twisting his trademark bronze waterfalls into contorted shapes and modeling them with ridges and furrows like drapery folds.
The results lack the inhuman elegance of his earlier work, but don't quite attain the Rodinesque muscularity he seems to be aiming for (Pepe Karmel).


Art in Review
Paul McCarthy  Museum of Modern Art 11 West 53d Street Manhattan Through July 18
The Los Angeles artist Paul McCarthy has been making his iconoclastic presence felt on the New York gallery scene for several years now.
A multi-media artist with a deep attraction to foodstuffs who works in video, performance, sculpture and installation, he's known for conjuring raunchy mixtures of sex, scatology, condiments and esthetics that satirize both the art world and society as a whole.
His latest bout of exhibitionism, a video-installation piece in the Projects gallery at the Museum of Modern Art, gives his talent its best New York showing yet.


President of Warriors Quits
ANDY DOLICH, the Golden State Warriors president and chief operating officer, resigned yesterday after being with the team about eight months.
Dolich, formerly with the Oakland Athletics for 15 years, said he was leaving because the Warriors' transition is complete, with a new owner, coach and general manager.
"We helped guide the organization through a change of ownership and restructuring," Dolich said.
"The basketball side of the operation is in great hands with the addition of DAVE TWARDZIK, RICK ADELMAN and a first-class coaching staff." (AP)


Interest Rate Cut By Fed Pushes Treasury Prices Up
Treasury prices surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of percentage point.
The move matched the expectations of many in the market, which had already priced in a cut of that size.
But many trader and analysts are still uncertain about how far the Fed's new course will take interest rates.


At New Javits Center, Work Is Cheaper, if Slower
The task may be simple -- unrolling a swatch of bright green carpet, tugging it into place and tacking it to the floor.
But before this week, said woodworkers with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, they had never been allowed to touch a piece of carpet.
"That was for the rug guys," said a union carpenter in a black T-shirt, as he pried open a crate yesterday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
On the other side of the cavernous convention hall, a 36-year-old carpenter who would identify himself only as Ronald stapled a pleated drape to a fold-out table for the first time in his three years of occasional work at the center.


A Hell's Kitchen Tale Is Doubted and Defended
"This is a true story about friendships that run deeper than blood," reads a passage from a new book about love, death and revenge in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan.
But despite the insistence of the publisher and the author himself that the book is true, there is growing talk in book publishing that the story is at least in part fiction.
Yesterday The Daily News published an article spelling out the allegations.
The book, "Sleepers," by Lorenzo Carcaterra, is about the ordeal of four boys in a reformatory and the revenge they wreak on their tormentors.
An alternate selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club, "Sleepers" is being published as nonfiction by Ballantine Books (it is already in bookstores) and has been sold for $2 million for adaptation as a movie to be directed by Barry Levinson.


Singles Bars And Single Half-Aliens
The creature at the center of "Species" is a result of one of those overreaching scientific experiments gone wrong.
In a quiet Government lab in Utah, Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) has combined human DNA with alien DNA that was beamed down from a supposedly friendly planet.
The new life form, named Sil, has a supermodel's body and face, presumably from her human genes.
The deadly tentacle that whips out from her mouth and tears people's throats apart comes from the extraterrestrial side of the family.
As Fitch and a team of experts track Sil through Los Angeles, this science-fiction thriller is slick and competent, but ultimately too predictable and by-the-numbers.
It begins with promising strangeness, leaping into the middle of a scene that is only gradually explained.
A 12-year-old blond girl is being gassed inside a chamber; Fitch is shedding a tear, though he understands that his prized creature must be destroyed, fast. (Some bad REM sleep has suggested violent times ahead.) But before the girl goes under, she crashes through the glass chamber and escapes.
En route to Los Angeles, she kills a vagrant and a train conductor.
She also mutates; her skin begins to bubble, she is enveloped in a huge sticky cocoon, and she steps off the train in L.A. as a grown woman (Natasha Henstridge) who somehow knows how to drive.


Sales Tax Is Wrong Bailout for Orange County
To the Editor:
"Orange County's Threat to Us All" (editorial, July 2) chided the voters of California's Orange County ("a very wealthy area") with "arrogance" because they rejected an increase in the sales tax to 8.25 percent.
The increase was the centerpiece of a plan making up for losses incurred by County Treasurer Robert Citron's rogue trading in the derivatives market.
You explained that the "outrageous" outcome of this vote was due to an "anti-tax ideology," which threatens "the very concept of government as a shared enterprise with benefits for all."

Rethinking Postwar Pigeonholes for Art
A mostly unstudied assumption nowadays holds that the European and American art scenes have increasingly come to resemble one another.
This is true, to a point.
But generally, Europeans are more comfortable with tradition than we are: Americans prize innovation and value art to the degree it's groundbreaking, while their artists recognize themselves as part of a history that they feel freer to draw from.
Which may explain why a traditional medium like painting is more vital to young European artists than to young Americans, and why Europeans extol postwar painters like Karel Appel and Asger Jorn, whom Americans regard as insufficiently radical.
Where is this line of thought going, you may wonder?
To a new three-part series at the Whitney Museum of American Art, "Views From Abroad," the first installment of which has just opened.
The idea is a good one, a variation on the notion that has artists organizing shows like the Artist's Choice exhibitions at the Modern of Modern Art.
In this case, the director of a European museum selects works from the Whitney's collection, giving a foreign slant, presumably, to American art.

RICHARD TYLER, the fashion designer, and LISA TRAFFICANTE, his wife and business partner, are the new owners of one of the city's grandest old residences: the 37-room Benjamin Sonnenberg house at Gramercy Park South and Irving Place.

Hotel Is Closing for Makeover
The Trump Regency Hotel will be closed for about six months when major renovations begin around Sept. 20, it was announced yesterday.
About 325 employees may find themselves out of work, at least temporarily.
But hotel officials said hundreds of new jobs will be created when the Trump Regency re-opens early next year.
When the makeover is completed, the hotel will be operated as a part of Trump Plaza, which will then become the largest hotel-casino in Atlantic City.

Brian Blades Is a Witness To Cousin's Shooting Death
Seattle Seahawks wide receiver BRIAN BLADES, who witnessed his cousin's shooting death on Wednesday, owned the gun that killed him, the police in Plantation, Fla., believe.
The police say it is unclear who pulled the trigger, but Brian Blades was the only other person in the room when the gun went off, killing Charles Blades, 34, of nearby Opa-locka with a single shot to the head.
"Right now we're going on the assumption it was an accident," Police Sgt.
MIKE PRICE told The Miami Herald for an article published yesterday.
"We do believe the gun belonged to Brian."


Rangers to Sign Two Top Picks
The Rangers are expected to announce today the signing of their two most recent first-round draft choices: Center Nicklas Sundstrom, eighth over all in the first round in 1993, and goalie Dan Cloutier, 26th in the first round of 1994.
Both players are expected to sign long-term contracts.
One factor in their signing might have been the implementation of the rookie salary cap of $850,000 per season, which goes into effect tomorrow.
Sundstrom, 6 feet and 183 pounds, turned 20 last month and is expected to contend for a position on the club in training camp.
He was born in Ornskoldsvik, Sweden, and last season with MoDo in Sweden had 8 goals and 13 assists in 33 games.

Drug for Treating Impotence Is Ready for Sale, F.D.A. Says
The Food and Drug Administration yesterday approved the marketing of the first prescription drug for the treatment of impotence, a condition that affects 10 million to 20 million American men.
The drug is administered by injection into the penis shortly before sexual intercourse.
It is not recommended for use more than three times a week or more than once in 24 hours.
Although it is intended for self-administration, "the first injections must be done in a physician's office by medically trained personnel," the F.D.A. said in a statement.


Karim Sanjabi, Politician, 90, Foe of Shah and Islamic Militants
Karim Sanjabi, a veteran Iranian politician who fought both the heavy-handed monarchy of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi and the harsh Islamic fundamentalism of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that followed, died in exile Tuesday at his home in Carbondale, Ill.
He was 90.
A law professor at Teheran University, he was associated with Mohammed Mossadegh, the nationalist Prime Minister who sought to nationalize the country's vast oil monopoly controlled by British interests.
Dr.
Mossadegh was ousted in 1951 in a coup engineered by the American and British intelligence services with the aid of the Shah's military.


Parks's Works to Go to Library of Congress
The Library of Congress is to announce today that it has acquired the archives of Gordon Parks, the photographer, writer, film maker and composer.

Parks's poems, novels and screenplays.
The library already holds the photographs that Mr.
Parks did in the 1940's for the Farm Security Administration and the Office of War Information under Roy Stryker, as well as his published and unpublished film scores and several of his film and television productions.

Not So Predictably, Graf and Sanchez Vicario Gain Final
Nobody cried, nobody choked and nobody's royal shoulder was stained by the tears of a defeated player -- but neither of Wimbledon's three-set women's semifinal matches today unfolded on a wholly predictable note either.
This Grand Slam tournament's defending champion not only developed a case of cold feet, she was also hobbled by blisters on both feet.
Exit Conchita Martinez, limping.

International Briefs; Fokker to Report Loss for the Half
Fokker N.V., the Dutch aircraft maker, said yesterday that it would report a loss for the first half of 1995 and was uncertain about a return to profitability in 1996.
Fokker, which is majority owned by Daimler-Benz Aerospace of Germany, said its loss for the first half of 1995 would exceed its loss of 449 million guilders ($290 million) for all of 1994.


A Painter Who Collaborated With Poets
Philip Guston produced some of the great abstract paintings of the 1950's and 60's.
With their shadowed greens and elegiac old-rose reds pulled to the center of the canvas, they suggest both poems on a page and the material traces of rumination, like late-night cigarette smudges in the bottom of a dish.
The artist's unpredicted switch to an anti-lyrical, Rabelaisian cartoon style in the late 60's baffled practically everyone.
Stung by the general critical disparagement, Guston retired to upstate New York and stayed there, pushing further along the difficult path he had set for himself, rebuking the art world from afar and choosing writers rather than artists as his companions.


You Want to Be a Star? Insist on a Staircase!
Any musical comedy don or diva, not to mention aspiring Sarah Bernhardts everywhere, can tell you that a staircase is a star's best friend.
For the Dollys and the Mames who preen step by calculated step to the serenades of infatuated choruses, for the flamboyantly cruel Regina Giddens in "The Little Foxes," for the flamboyantly crazy monarch of "The Madness of George III," nothing quite becomes an entrance, an exit or a legend-in-the-making like a heady flight of stairs.
But staircases afford theatrical uses well beyond their status as platforms for aggrandizing and posturing.
Linking public and private worlds and the visible with the unseen, they have symbolic and emotional resonance that the right combinations of actor, director and set designer can turn into intricate guides to themes and characters.
Currently on view on Broadway stages are three very different sets of stairs that splendidly meet the dramatic purposes of three very different plays, which these days is enough to create a whole new Tony category.

Tam Ly dresses in the image of the father he never knew, in camouflage clothing and combat boots and, for good measure, a rakish pair of black sunglasses.
Born out of wedlock, nursed in a Buddhist temple in Vietnam, reared on the streets where he sold honey cakes outside the central cathedral in Ho Chi Minh City, Mr.
Tam, now 23, came to the United States two years ago as part of a belated Government program to accept the offspring of American servicemen abandoned by their fathers in South Vietnam.


Regulators Examine Investment Adviser's Registration Tangle
First Capital Strategists, the investment adviser whose rogue trader lost $128 million in the account of the Common Fund, first registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a commodities trading adviser in 1987.
But it was not until last year that First Capital completed a similar filing as a registered investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Why those filings were not made until years after the York, Pa., firm was founded in 1980 are among the questions being asked by Federal and state regulators.

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN BRONX CLUB FIRE
More than five years after the arson fire that killed 87 people at the Happy Land social club in the Bronx, lawyers for families of the victims agreed to a $15.8 million settlement of all claims in the blaze, which became the worst case of mass murder in the nation's history.
The agreement ends more than $5 billion in lawsuits by providing an average $163,000 for each of the 92 dead or injured victims, before lawyers' fees and other costs.  [ Page A1. ]

Former Newark Official Is Sentenced for Graft
A former City Councilman was sentenced to 33 months in prison and fined $26,000 on corruption charges today in a case that provided a window onto the kind of under-the-table deals that Federal prosecutors assert are rampant in Newark.
While relatives of the former official, Ralph T. Grant Jr., sobbed and hugged each other in court, Mr.
Grant's lawyer, Clarence Faines 3d, said he would appeal the conviction.
Mr.
Grant remained free on $10,000 bail.


29 Latin Kings Gang Leaders Are Indicted
Leaders of one of the city's most notorious criminal gangs, the Latin Kings, were charged yesterday with attempted murder, murder, racketeering, heroin and cocaine trafficking, and other crimes in an 80-count Federal indictment.
"These indictments are aimed at the leadership," said Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.
She said that for 27 of the 29 defendants named in the indictment, the maximum sentence would be life in prison.
Of the two remaining defendants, she added, one faces 20 years, the other 105.


Nelson Vows to Rev Up Offense and Laugh Track
After saying he would trade in his coaching sneakers for "some of them Guccis," he promised to run, gun and have fun.
There is indeed a new sheriff in town.
Don Nelson took over New York's basketball team yesterday, and you may want to take a long, hard look at the Knicks today.
They are not likely to be the same tomorrow.
Nelson, three times the National Basketball Association coach of the year and a man who has guided his teams to 50-victory seasons nine times, signed a three-year contract that will pay him nearly $6 million in base salary.
With his hiring, the Knicks ushered in a new coaching era and put behind them four successful but sometimes trying years under Pat Riley.
Nothing personal, said Nelson, but Riley had his way of doings things and Nelson has his own.
The main thing, said the 55-year-old coach, is that they find a way to bring home a championship banner to the Garden.

Two major shareholders immediately said that they would try to replace the board with a group that, free of Mr.
Pickens's control, would look to the company's sale or merger.


No Need to Raise Anxiety About Food
To the Editor:
Consumers reading "Congress Moving to Revamp Rules on Food Safety" (front page, July 3), your article on proposed changes in food safety laws, might conclude that Republicans in Congress are conspiring with the food industry to increase the number of "carcinogens" and pathogens in our food supply, all in pursuit of increased profits (presumably Republicans have stashed away a separate, safe food supply for their own consumption).


Sports of The Times; How Arantxa Used Chris as Her Model
SHE was only 16 when she first put her feet on the treacherous grass of Wimbledon.
It took her three tournaments to finally win a match there.

Chris Evert had won three Wimbledons with a game better suited for slower, more predictable surfaces.
That is what a champion -- or at least a professional -- does.


Ruling on Police Is Reversed
The State Supreme Court ruled yesterday that police officers cannot be sued for injuries sustained in high-speed chases unless they intentionally disobey orders or violate department rules, The Associated Press reported.
An appeals court had held that a Neptune Township police officer, Frederick Jenkins, was liable for injuries suffered by a passenger in a car with which his car collided, on the ground that his was not the vehicle being chased.
In reversing the earlier ruling, the Supreme Court said the law on police immunity was designed to "encourage vigorous law enforcement."

The Tale of Camelot, Now Color Coordinated
"First Knight" is distinguished from other, better retellings of the Arthurian legend by its conviction that Camelot was ruled by someone much more powerful than a mere king: a decorator.
How else to explain blue rooftops that match the blue Round Table, on which the knights clank down their swords in perfect symmetry?
Or the coordinating blue accents on the peasants' robes?
Obviously, attention to appearances also colored the casting, since the presence of Richard Gere emphasizes Lancelot's studly side.
Try to remain calm when Sean Connery (King Arthur) tells his preening co-star, "The truth is, you care nothing for yourself."
Draped in costumes that would be just right for the Starship Enterprise, this film's medieval mannequins act out a stiff, grandiose version of Camelot's triangular love story, punctuated by occasional battle scenes that look suspiciously computer enhanced.
Visual effects also amplify the glittering shots of a Camelot that's only slightly smaller than Manhattan.
In terms of aural flourishes, noisy clanging and Jerry Goldsmith's thunderingly banal score accompany the combat scenes that present Mr.
Gere's dueling dude as a walking anachronism.
It's definitely time for Hollywood to lay down its swords this season.


Baghdad's Biological Arsenal
After four years of denial, deception and evasion, Iraq has acknowledged that it stockpiled frighteningly large quantities of germ warfare agents in the late 1980's.
Regrettably, it has yet to explain fully what subsequently became of the thousands of gallons of anthrax bacteria and botulism toxin it produced, enough to make hundreds of lethal bombs, each one capable of killing thousands of people.
Biological agents have no real battlefield utility.
They are terror weapons designed for the wholesale slaughter of civilians and the blackmail of their governments.
Iraq is not the only country to develop biological weapons.
The United States and Soviet Union produced them during the cold war.
But given Saddam Hussein's demonstrated record of aggression and ruthlessness, his possession of such means of mass murder is a chilling thought.


It Must Be Midnight And Must Be Weird
IT was close to midnight on a wet Saturday, and the corner of Third Avenue and 11th Street was a collage of umbrellas as the usual swarm of uppity clubgoers, weekend barflies and itinerant musicians moved through the rain.
Under the glow of the Sony East Village's movie theater marquee, however, a more dour crowd waited in a short line to buy tickets to "Batman Forever."
"Midnight is a terrible time for a movie," said Joanne Elliott, a 17-year-old model.
"It's late, and I should be sleeping."


Latin-Spouting Hustler From the East Goes West
Described by TNT as a student of Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma, P. J. Pesce makes his feature-film directorial debut on Sunday with "The Desperate Trail," a homage, we are told, to the westerns of Howard Hawks, Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah.
Apparent proof: scene after scene of bloody shootouts.
For all its violence, "The Desperate Trail" is also chock full of offbeat civility.
The film opens with a stagecoach ambush that leaves two strangers linked to each other's fate.
Jack Cooper (Craig Sheffer) is a classical-Latin-spouting hustler from the East on the way to visit the ranch of his otherworldly brother, Walter (Frank Whaley), an amateur astronomer.
Sarah O'Rourke (Linda Fiorentino) is a murderer being accompanied to justice by an exceedingly dour marshal (Sam Elliott).
When Jack and Sarah take off with the Wells Fargo cash box, the marshal and his posse chase them with a vengeance.

Excerpts From the President's Speech at Georgetown University
Following are excerpts from remarks by President Clinton at Georgetown University today.
They were made available by the Federal News Service, a private transcription service:
Today I want to have more of a conversation than deliver a formal speech, about the great debate now raging in our nation, not so much over what we should do, but over how we should resolve the great questions of our time here in Washington and in communities all across our country.
I want to talk about the obligations of citizenship, the obligations imposed on the President and people in power, and the obligations imposed on all Americans.

Kevin Bubriski  National Arts Club 15 Gramercy Park South Tomorrow and Sunday
The people in Kevin Bubriski's black-and-white portraits, made over the last decade in Nepal, Tibet and northern India, face the camera with quiet, almost meditative assurance.
The most persuasive pictures were made with large-format cameras, and reflect the deliberate seeing that such cumbersome equipment favors.


Corrections
A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about the credit markets misstated the average yields this week for participation certificates of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac.
The yield for the 15-year certificate was 7 percent, not 7.03 percent; the yield for the 30-year certificate was 7.39 percent, not 7.53 percent.
A corrected chart appears today on page D15.

International Briefs; Accor to Sell Unit To Compass Group
Accor S.A., the debt-laden French hotel company, formally announced yesterday that it was selling Eurest, its catering business, to Compass Group P.L.C. for a big stake in the British company and 2.1 billion francs ($433 million) in cash.
Accor said the move would create one of the world's biggest catering companies, with global revenue of 20.4 billion francs ($4.2 billion).
The French company's stake in the new company formed around Compass will be 22.5 percent.


Symantec Offers To Buy Delrina As Windows 95 Release Nears
The Symantec Corporation said today that it would acquire the Delrina Corporation, best known for its Winfax software, in a stock swap valued at $415 million.
The deal would add Delrina's communications programs to the mix of utilities and programming tools produced by Symantec, which is based in Cupertino, Calif.
The acquisition is the latest in a wave of software industry mergers.
The consolidation is expected to increase as the Aug. 24 shipping date of the Microsoft Corporation's new Windows 95 operating system approaches.
Windows 95 will incorporate many functions that were previously filled by separate application programs, often sold by other companies.


Your Gerrymander or Mine?
The Supreme Court's decision declaring Georgia's 11th Congressional district unconstitutional is more than a setback for minority groups in their battle to gain fair representation.
It reflects a serious misunderstanding of how redistricting works.
The ruling, in Miller v.
Johnson, follows Shaw v.
Reno, the 1993 case that invalidated a North Carolina Congressional district that was shaped like a carnival serpent.


A Miami Lawyer Is Chosen to Investigate Commerce Secretary's Finances
A panel of Federal appellate judges today appointed a veteran Miami lawyer as an independent prosecutor to investigate the personal finances of Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown.
The inquiry is the fourth criminal investigation involving high-ranking officials in the Clinton Administration.
The judicial panel selected Daniel S. Pearson, a partner at Holland &amp; Knight, one of Florida's largest law firms.
Mr.
Pearson, 64, was a Federal prosecutor in Miami in the early 1960's and a state appeals court judge from 1980 to 1989.
In recent years he has worked on appellate litigation.


3 Are Shot in a Chinatown Gambling Den
Three men were shot inside a Chinatown gambling den yesterday afternoon in an incident that appeared to involve Chinese gangs, law enforcement officials said.
Shortly after the shooting, the men staggered onto the street, jumped into a gray Honda Accord and were taken to a nearby clinic, where officials summoned the police.


Trade Climate With U.S. Improving, Europeans Say
After weeks of criticizing the Clinton Administration for its threatened trade sanctions against Japan and, more recently, for pulling out of talks on opening global financial markets, the European Commission said today that the trade picture between Europe and the United States was brightening.
Relations with Washington "are better than they have been for some time," the commission said in a statement accompanying its annual review of American trade barriers.
"Mainly due to resolving bilateral problems during the Uruguay Round" of trade negotiations, this year's report is 40 pages shorter than last year's, the Europeans noted.


Gingrich, on Book Tour, Quickly Wields the Pen
Far from the madding legislation, the Speaker moved the goods, signing "Newt" with mercantile abandon into each $24 copy of his new book as a line of devotees moved past, cash in hand, heart on sleeve.
"Hey, Newt, you get rich yet?" a New York voice bellowed from the nonbuying part of the audience yesterday at Barnes &amp; Noble's Fifth Avenue store, where Speaker Newt Gingrich, flushed with success in wielding majority control over Congress, seemed born to the ephemeral art of book touring.


Visiting Athlete Disappears During a Swim
Coast Guard and police helicopters and boats searched Long Island Sound today for a Special Olympics athlete from Nepal who disappeared while swimming during a visit to Hammonasset Beach State Park in Madison, the authorities said.
The 21-year-old mentally retarded athlete, whom The Associated Press identified as Ramesh Mali, was last seen about 12:15 P.M. in water up to his chest off a section of the two-mile beach where lifeguards were not stationed, the authorities said.
Divers and other rescuers, assisted by two helicopters and several boats, focused on a stretch of shore several hundred yards long.

When the Federal Reserve dropped the other shoe yesterday, the stock market reacted with a surge of energy.
Within minutes after the Fed's Open Market Committee announced at 2:15 P.M. that it was lowering its target for the Federal funds rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to 5.75 percent, buyers poured into the market, sending the key averages into record territory.


Schools Chief Who Stressed Diversity in Ithaca Quits Post
The Superintendent of Schools in Ithaca, N.Y., who had sought to merge high school honors courses with those at more modest academic levels as a way of promoting diversity, resigned on Wednesday night, citing the angry reaction that his plans had touched off among some parents and members of the school board.
"Professionally, I believe the systematic tracking of students is wrong," said Dr.
James E. Lorthridge, the Superintendent, in a statement he read at a Board of Education meeting Wednesday night.
"And I choose not to be part of a system that participates in this educational practice."


After 92 Days of Testimony, Simpson Prosecution Rests
With some final fragments of hair and fiber evidence and a statement from Nicole Brown Simpson's mother, prosecutors at the O. J. Simpson trial quietly and unceremoniously rested this afternoon -- 92 days of testimony, 58 witnesses, 488 exhibits, and 34,500 transcript pages after they began.
Prosecutors had once hinted at concluding with a flourish, something that could compensate for weeks of stultifying scientific testimony, remind the jury of the case's heart-wrenching essence and perhaps erase lingering images of Mr.
Simpson's struggling to don the leather gloves he wore, they say, when he killed his former wife and Ronald L. Goldman.


CHRONICLE
STEPHEN HAWKING, the British physicist and Cambridge University professor, will marry a nurse who was hired by his former wife to help him cope with the motor neuron disease that has crippled him since his student days, The Daily Telegraph reported yesterday.
According to the newspaper's account, Professor Hawking, 53, whose book "A Brief History of Time" was a best seller, plans to marry ELAINE MASON at the Cambridge Register Office on Sept. 16.
A blessing will be conferred at St.
Barnabas Church, and a reception will be held at Madingley Hall near Cambridge.


Giuliani Replaces Water Board Members After Criticism of Plan to Sell Water System
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has replaced a majority of the members of the New York City Water Board in recent weeks, not long after several members of the board raised questions about his plan to sell the city's water system to the board to raise money.
The four board members, at least one of whom raised money in opposition to Mr.
Giuliani's mayoral campaign, were appointed by previous mayors and their terms were up.
Most expected to be replaced eventually.
But the former chairman of the seven-member board, who received his removal notice this week, said the replacements went beyond normal turnover.

Teen-Agers in Washington Face New Curfew
Citing a "culture of fear and violence" permeating the city, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. today signed into law a curfew intended to keep teen-agers off Washington streets at night, when much of the city's violent crime is committed.
"We believe our young people ought to be safe from handgun violence and violent assaults," Mr.
Barry said at a news conference before signing the measure, which affects young people under 17.


Woman's Waking Nightmare
Karen and Jim Webb, the unhappy childless couple at the heart of Alex Graves's moody film "The Crude Oasis," live in an immaculate ranch house across the road from an oil refinery in the Kansas flat lands near Wichita.
Karen (Jennifer Taylor), who is emotionally unstable, has a recurrent nightmare in which she stands at the edge of a river in the pouring rain and a young man wading knee-deep in the water notices her watching him and approaches her in a threatening manner.
When Karen wakes with a start, it is into a world that is as ominous as her dream.
Her gaunt, stone-faced husband, who works in the refinery, often returns home late at night with lame excuses as to his whereabouts.
When Karen becomes upset, Jim (Robert Peterson) tries to calm her in an eerily robotic voice, as if he were addressing a child.


Careiro da Varzea Journal; Who Braves Piranha Waters? Your Avon Lady!

With no doorbells to ring at the riverside shanties on stilts, this Avon lady of the Amazon claps her hands and calls out cheerily: "Hi, honey!  I'm here!"

Helen J. Boiardi, 90; Started Line of Pasta
Helen J. Boiardi, who helped to launch the Chef Boyardee line of prepared pasta dinners, died on Monday at her home in Shaker Heights, Ohio.
She was 90.
In the 1920's she and her husband, Hector Boiardi, a successful chef, opened a restaurant in Cleveland's financial district.
Its spaghetti dinners proved so savory that customers asked for portions of pasta, sauce and cheese to take home.


Hours Later, Mets Boot Out Excitement of Victory
The Mets, fresh off a rare ninth-inning victory at home the night before, fell into a not-so-rare lethargy early in the bright afternoon sun and heavy humidity at Shea Stadium yesterday.
Their starter, Pete Harnisch, yielded a home run to the first batter of the game, and their fielders committed two errors that led to two more Chicago runs before the conclusion of the first inning.
Matters worsened in the seventh inning, where the stretching amounted to the Cubs extending their lead with four more unearned runs.
And that pretty much wrapped up an 8-4 victory over the Mets in a game that Harnisch called "horrible and ugly."


I.B.M. Creates a Division For Its At-Home Offerings
Taking aim at the fast-growing market for computer-related home electronics, I.B.M. will create a division responsible for expanding the company's offerings to consumers, company executives said yesterday.
The new division, which will be formally announced later this year and has still not been named, will bring several of the International Business Machines Corporation's consumer-oriented products, like multimedia personal computers and software, under one umbrella.
It will also be the focus of I.B.M.'s efforts to develop new products in the areas of consumer electronics, software and perhaps even on-line services.


METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK MURDER RATE PLUNGES SHARPLY In an acceleration of a four-year trend, the murder rate in New York City has plunged sharply since January to the lowest level in 25 years, according to Police Department statistics.
In the first 25 weeks of the year, murders have fallen by nearly a third, to 563 from 826 in the same period last year.
If the trend holds through the rest of the year, 1995 will record the fewest slayings since 1970, when 1,117 people were killed.  [ Page 1. ] PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL SEEKS MERGER Convinced that it cannot survive on its own in a medical marketplace racked by budget cuts and dominated by managed care, Presbyterian Hospital, one of the city's premiere academic hospitals, is actively looking to merge with another medical center.

Gay Russians Are 'Free' Now But Still Stay in Fearful Closet
At first glance Aleksandr Korotkov seems like the happiest man in Russia.
Packed tightly into a black leather jumpsuit and dancing as if a disco beat had taken hold of his soul, once a week he becomes an openly gay man in a society that has never had much use for openness or for homosexuality.
Mr.
Korotkov, who is 27, earns enough as a graphics designer to live here in a comfortable apartment.
He owns a car, and every Saturday he spends $30 for the privilege of entering Mayak, this city's most fashionable gay nightclub.


Your Attention, Please
Republicans have a right to their suspicions about President Clinton's calls for an end to harsh partisanship.
Mr.
Clinton never hesitated to slug them in the eye back when he had the Congressional majority to back him up.
But a President without votes on the Hill must placate more often than threaten.
So Mr.
Clinton's "common-ground" speech at Georgetown University can be read by political realists as an attempt to make a virtue of necessity.
The necessity, in Mr.
Clinton's case, was created by his party's collapse at the polls in 1994.
If 1996 is to be any different for the Democrats -- and more to the point, their standard-bearer -- Mr.
Clinton needs Republican help in establishing himself as a bipartisan leader.
Even allowing for this most cynical reading of the politics of his speech, the President is right on its core ideas.
The ills afflicting American society do not flow from the fact that the middle class no longer possesses the moral perfection of, let us say, Jesse Helms and Phil Gramm.
Mr.
Clinton is closer to the truth when he points up that "middle-class values and strong families" are threatened by a consistent economic battering for which no end is in sight.


Slide From Riches for Landlord in Happy Land Case
The building housing the Happy Land Social Club, where 87 people died in a 1990 arson fire, was owned by Alexander DiLorenzo 3d, scion of a real estate empire that at one time put him in the same league as Donald Trump or other New York tycoons.
But lawyers for the victims who filed suit over the tragedy, which was caused in part by conditions in the building, found Mr.
DiLorenzo so deeply enmeshed in financial problems that they gave up on seeking damages from him.
"If we had gone after DiLorenzo, we would have spent 5 or 10 years trying to to figure where his money was, or if there was any left," said Paul E. Bleifer, who represented the families of 17 of the victims.


Gas Main Is Safely Repaired
A ruptured section of a high-pressure gas main crossing Route 22 at Foothill Road in Bridgewater was repaired yesterday by Public Service Electric &amp; Gas crews.
Traffic had been diverted onto nearby Interstate 287 during the morning rush hour on Thursday while an emergency patch was installed, but no diversion was necessary yesterday, according to Lieut.
James Piliani of the Bridgewater police.
The main is not part of the gas pipeline that blew up near Edison in March 1994.


Brown Tide Spreading Misery on L.I.
The bays and estuaries of Eastern Long Island are being invaded by a massive bloom of brown algae for the first time in a decade, devastating fragile scallop beds and causing tourists to turn away in disgust.
"This is the most extensive bloom since we began monitoring the brown tide," said Vito Minei, chief of ecology for the Suffolk County Department of Health.
"While it looks unpleasant, it does not represent a health hazard to humans. But it's deadly for the scallop, causing it to starve to death."


Drink Up, It's Closing Time
Bars on the Boardwalk in Point Pleasant are closing a little earlier on weekends, starting immediately, to cut down on late-night rowdiness of the sort that occurred last month between off-duty New York City officers and the local police.
Three Boardwalk saloons -- Jenkinson's, Martell's and Major's -- agreed to stop serving drinks and shut down the bands at 1 A.M. on weekends, an hour earlier than usual.
The bars' licenses come up for renewal Tuesday before the Borough Council.


Harold R. Neumann, 89, Pilot Who Won Speed-Racing Titles
Harold R. Neumann, a champion airplane speed-racing pilot in the 1930's who went on to set record cross-Atlantic flight times as a commercial pilot, died on Wednesday in San Jose, Calif., the Associated Press reported.
He was 89.
Mr.
Neumann was named the fastest airplane pilot in 1935 after winning the Thompson Trophy race in the National Air Races in Cleveland.
He also won the Louis W. Greve trophy, piloting his plane, Mike, an average 207 miles an hour for the 75 miles of the race before 65,000 people at Cleveland Airport.
Mr.
Neumann received $4,500 for his winning effort, cutting each pylon close as he flew around the quadrangular five-mile course 15 times.


Man Photographed After Attack Is Ruled Out as Unabom Suspect
A man photographed acting suspiciously at the scene of a fatal mail bombing in Sacramento, Calif., last April is not a suspect in that attack, the Sacramento police said today.
The Federal authorities have attributed the Sacramento attack to the terrorist commonly known as the Unabomber, and Federal agents investigating the Unabom case recently showed the grainy photograph to scrap-yard dealers in the San Francisco area.
The picture came from a videotape made by a photographer hired by the Sacramento police.


Sports of The Times; Endless And Special Possibilities
FOR the past 48 hours, I've been in bed, trying to find a position of least pain.
The July 4th holiday weekend proved too much for a bad back to bear.
I aggravated a chronic condition while participating in the he-man Olympics of a summer weekend: lifting heavy barbecue pits, dragging ice-filled coolers and chairs to and from the beach.
The final straw was accepting the challenge to chase some 8-year-olds over sand, twisting and turning to grab them as they tried to get away.
The progressive strain of it all put me here in bed, staring at the ceiling, contemplating the blessings of good health.

Dying Hamlet With 15 Reveries
Hamlet as Dracula, as Norman Bates, as a galumphing vaudevillian, as a magician and as a lost little boy: these are some of the more indelible images that Robert Wilson brings to mind in his expressionistic portrayal of the melancholy Dane in "Hamlet: A Monologue."
This deconstructed version of Shakespeare's masterpiece, which had the first of three performances at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday as part of the Serious Fun festival, may be the most overtly emotional theater piece ever created by Mr.
Wilson.
Its more impassioned moments are so heated that it is tempting to look for an autobiographical subtext in his magnetic, self-lacerating performance.


Chess Masters Seeking Match At Trade Center
Two of the world's best chess players may battle for supremacy within the glass-enclosed observation deck of the World Trade Center in a match starting in early September.
Negotiations are nearly finalized for the champion of the Professional Chess Association, Garry Kasparov of Russia, to defend his world title against Viswanathan Anand of India, according to Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the World Trade Center.


Midlife Crisis for the JVC Festival?
This summer's JVC Jazz Festival, in its 41st year, was remarkably unfestive and unadventurous, offering little to anybody who had even a cursory knowledge of New York's jazz clubs.
With few exceptions, the festival, which ended on Sunday, was a mishmash of jazz's last big names, New York regulars and free outdoor concerts that served as living billboards for the rosters of the record companies that underwrote them.
Running nearly concurrently with the JVC, Michael Dorf's What Is Jazz? festival at the Knitting Factory was a genuine festival, with music bubbling on several stages at once, offering a mix of some of the club's regular performers and out-of-towners who are rarely heard here.
It was packed with crowds taking advantage of the low cover charge and the broad variety of music that comes less under the heading of jazz than of improvised music.
It was an event, one that got the blood running, while the JVC Jazz Festival frequently sagged.


With the Owner Watching, Another Rookie Makes Yanks Squirm
With George Steinbrenner sitting beside their dugout waving his hand in disgust and their newest player sitting by himself in the bullpen and the dugout tonight, the Yankees watched in amazement as another young starter was humiliated early.
At least Andy Pettitte waited until the second inning before disintegrating.
After one inning, the Yankees and Texas Rangers were scoreless.
After two innings, the Rangers had a 5-0 lead.
After three innings, the Rangers had a 10-0 advantage and Pettitte was trying to forget that 200 of his friends and relatives were squirming in their seats.
They had traveled from Deer Park, Tex., to watch the 23-year-old rookie, but they saw him suffer a 10-0 defeat to Bob Tewksbury and the Rangers.


Downing of U.S. Fighter Over Bosnia Is Tied to Shortcoming of NATO Plane
American military officials knew a hostile missile radar was tracking Capt.
Scott F. O'Grady's F-16 fighter jet several minutes before he was shot down over Bosnia last month, but could not alert him because of a technical shortcoming on a NATO early-warning plane, military officials said today.
A Pentagon report on the causes of the downing concludes that the NATO Awacs, which would have relayed the warning to the pilot, did not have equipment to transmit and receive highly classified electronic messages from American intelligence officials.

Dow Gallops Past 4,700, Riding on Fed's Rate Cut
Just two days after the Dow Jones industrial average first topped the 4,600 mark, it soared past 4,700 yesterday, as the stock market enjoyed its best week since last August.
The Dow closed at 4,702.73, up 38.73 points for the day and 146.63 points for the week.
Less than five months ago this key indicator exceeded 4,000 for the first time.


Japan Joins U.S. to Block Fall by Dollar
Seeking to prevent the Federal Reserve's Thursday interest-rate reduction from weakening the dollar, the Japanese Government pushed down interest rates slightly in Tokyo today and then intervened in American currency markets with the United States to prop up the dollar.
The combined effect was a sharp rise in the dollar's value against the yen, as many traders concluded that Washington and Tokyo were more closely coordinating their economic policies and would prevent any further fall in the dollar.
In late trading, the dollar had surged 1.80 yen, to 86.76 yen to the dollar.

Romanian Champion Is Banned for Life
A Romanian women's rowing champion, FANICA HANUSEAC, has been banned for life after she failed a doping test, the Romanian Rowing Federation said yesterday.
The International Rowing Federation banned Hanuseac, 27, who was part of Romania's 1994 gold-medal winning team, after she tested positive for nandrolon, an anabolic steroid, in two separate tests taken this year, according to a federation statement. (AP)


Latin America Now Ignores U.S. Lead in Isolating Cuba
One Brazilian company has a contract to paint the peeling Havana Libre hotel, long a symbol of Cuba's revolution.
Another is shipping an entire cigarette factory to Cuba to revive tobacco production.
Once an obedient follower of the United States trade embargo on Cuba, Latin America increasingly ignores Washington, choosing to develop full economic and diplomatic relations with the Communist Government.
The United States is the only country in the Americas with a trade ban on Cuba and one of only five that do not have formal ties with it.


Religion Journal; A Producer-Priest Rates Hollywood Worthy of Praise
"Lord, a lot of people are mad at us," the Rev.

"They say we are responsible for the problems of society."
It was a sobering note on which to begin.
But Father Kieser's words opened a festive occasion, one that might have pleased even some of the entertainment industry's sharpest critics -- the 21st annual Humanitas Awards, which honor television and movie scriptwriters for work uplifting humane values.

Tokyo Stocks Soar by 6.3% on Unexpected Rate Cut
Tokyo stock prices jumped 6.3 percent yesterday, lifted by an unexpected cut in interest rates and investor hopes that the Government would take stronger measures to aid Japan's sagging economy.
But some analysts said they doubted the market's buoyancy would last.
The Bank of Japan surprised financial markets by announcing yesterday that it would lower a key short-term interest rate.
The announcement gave further momentum to the stock market, which had risen during the three prior sessions.

The Yankees injected a serious wrinkle today into a season that has hardly been smooth when they recalled Dave Pavlas, a relief pitcher from Class AAA Columbus who defied the players association and his 24 new teammates this past spring by pitching for New York's replacement team.
In attempting to elevate their bullpen with a reliever who had a 0.00 earned run average in 11 innings of replacement games in March, the Yankees might have stepped on the toes of their regular players.
When the players' strike and replacement baseball ended in April, the Yankees retained some strike-breaking players and knew this kind of situation might arrive.
It finally did today, and the other relievers offered the players' initial reaction by not welcoming Pavlas and sitting apart from him in the bullpen during tonight's 10-0 loss to the Texas Rangers.

Murdoch before Congress goes on vacation in August.


Older, Wiser, and Again in the Wimbledon Final
A decade ago, a strapping, freckled and fearless 17-year-old loose cannon from Germany turned Wimbledon into his own personal demolition derby, rising from the ranks of the anonymous and crashing his way to the 1985 championship.
It was a phenomenal launch for what has been a nonpareil career, especially here at Wimbledon, the Grand Slam tournament he uses as his touchstone, his looking glass and his motivation to continue hauling his jaded bones around the tennis circuit.
He does it all for the chance that he might win this Grand Slam event one more time.


Germans' Ozone Concerns and Love of Speed Meet Head On
What passes for summer -- a muggy gasp from the jaws of the Rhine -- has settled in here, and with it has blossomed a remarkably passionate debate that pits two sides of Germany's soul against each other: the right to speed against the right to breathe; a pious regard for the environment at the ballot box against foot-down frenzy at the steering wheel.
At issue is smog, the blanket of toxic fumes produced when sunlight combines with chemicals from car exhaust and industrial plants to yield perilous levels of ozone at ground level.


A Way to Know Who's Calling?
The State Board of Public Utilities has authorized Bell Atlantic to start a six-month trial in the 201 and 908 area codes of a service known as CALL 54.
It tells callers the name and address attached to any phone number, excluding unlisted numbers and those of other customers who ask not to be included.
The trial should be starting in a week or two.
Another service approved yesterday is Caller ID Deluxe, which displays a caller's name and phone number -- including those of customers with unpublished numbers who do not request to be blocked.
The board also told Bell Atlantic it could increase monthly rates for unpublished numbers to $1.44 from $1.04.


Angus McDonald, China Specialist, 53
Angus W. McDonald Jr., a specialist in the Communist revolution in China and founder of the Asia Education Center in Minneapolis, died on Monday at his home in Minneapolis.
He was 53.
The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, said Archibald Spencer, a friend.
Dr.
McDonald graduated from Amherst College in 1965 and earned a doctorate in Chinese history at the University of California at Berkeley.

Industrial Arts Program to End
Citing declining enrollment, a high dropout rate and failure to meet state standards, the Board of Education has abolished its industrial arts department after 34 years.
The department is no longer preparing students for vocations "at the entry level," said Peter Fischbach, the assistant superintendent of schools.
Students seeking jobs as electricians, carpenters, auto mechanics and plumbers will be accommodated at vocational schools in Hudson County, he said.

Conservatives' New Frontier: Religious Liberty Law Firms
Following their thrust into national politics, religious conservatives are creating their own legal organizations to combat what they see as a broad assault on religious liberties.
More than half a dozen religious liberty law firms, some founded in the 1990's, are waging battles in courts, schools and city halls to carve out a greater public space for religious activity -- be it for student Bible clubs in schools, for the display of crosses in public parks or prayers at graduation ceremonies.


Judge Chides City Officials On Squatters
New York City suffered a minor setback yesterday in its efforts to evict squatters from two buildings it owns on East 13th Street in Manhattan, but it also received a major tongue-lashing from a State Supreme Court justice for its militarylike handling of evictions from two other buildings on the same street in May.
"I will not permit you to use another ruse to get into another building to create mayhem," said Justice Elliott Wilk in denying an emergency petition by city lawyers to clear squatters from two of its buildings, at 537 and 539 East 13th Street.


School Official Denies Rancid Turkey Report
A report last month alleging that school food officials approved huge shipments of rancid food to cafeterias is as flimsy as a "house of cards" and contains a flawed analysis, according to the school system's top food-service official, who was removed from his job because of the report.
The official, Kevin F. Gill, contends through his lawyer, John F. Kaley, that investigators misunderstood documents and had no proof to support their charge of deception.


Brown Tide Returns to Eastern L.I.
The bays and estuaries of eastern Long Island are being invaded by a vast bloom of brown algae for the first time in a decade, devastating fragile scallop beds and causing tourists to turn away in disgust.
The algae is not a health hazard to humans, officials say.
But the baymen who depend on the scallop for a good part of their seasonal income -- and who had one of their best years last year -- say this year's crop is a disaster.

For Greenpeace Guerrillas, Environmentalism Is Again a Growth Industry
After being lowered from a helicopter, Micheal O'Cadhla and three other Greenpeace commandos had barricaded themselves onto an oil-storage platform as it was being towed toward its ocean grave.

Greenpeace sent Mr. O'Cadhla and his team to prevent this.


Middle-Aged Machinations Frustrated by Young Love
The play's the thing at the Vineyard's 26th Street Theater, 309 East 26th Street, Kips Bay, where the National Asian-American Theater Company has revived Moliere's comic masterpiece "The School for Wives."
In an eloquent translation by Richard Wilbur enacted on a serene garden set designed by Sarah Lambert, Stephen Stout's direction unfolds once more the wise and witty tale of the middle-aged Arnolphe, who so relishes the marital misadventures of others.
Not for him the horns of a cuckold.
No, indeed.
He has a foolproof plan: to wed his young ward, convent-raised under his instructions to be ignorant, innocent, dependent and naive.


Penguins Are Letting Free Agents Leave

Out of Sight, Out of Mind, but Not Out of Work; Town Finds Space for Welcome Mat, Postage-Stamp Size, for Immigrant Laborers
In the century that this community has existed, crises have often been resolved with bluster and bravado.
In the 1980's, Glen Cove taunted the Soviet Union with the ultimate municipal threat -- canceled beach passes.
In the 1990's, city officials sought to rid their downtown of large groups of Central American day laborers with a tough ordinance aimed at ousting undocumented workers who used the community's street corners as outdoor hiring halls.


L.I. Boy, 13, Is Killed in Fall From Elementary School Roof
A 13-year-old boy playing with friends on the roof of an elementary school Thursday night was fatally injured when he fell through a skylight, the police said today.
The victim, James Clifford, who was to have celebrated his 14th birthday today at a Rollerblade party, climbed to the roof of the Gatelot Elementary School on Gatelot Avenue near his home in Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., around 9:30 P.M., accompanied by two companions, said Detective Lieut.
John Gierasch, chief of the Suffolk County police homicide squad.


JOBLESS RATE FELL
The job market perked up in June as employers added 215,000 payroll jobs while the unemployment rate edged down slightly to 5.6 percent, the Labor Department reported today.
Despite a stronger overall performance than most analysts expected, there were some pockets of weakness.
Factory jobs -- which tend to be better paying than most -- dropped 40,000, the third straight sizable decline.
Such unevenness blunted the second-guessing by some analysts and investors of the Federal Reserve's decision on Thursday to reverse course and cut short-term interest rates for the first time since 1992.
The Fed acted before it was fully aware of the latest report, which suggested that the current economic slowdown is unlikely to turn into a recession.

Rate Setters Miss Data, Just Barely
While Federal Reserve officials were meeting Thursday morning to decide whether to cut short-term interest rates, another agency was quietly putting the finishing touches on the most important set of monthly economic figures published by the Government.
By a quirk of the calendar, the central bank's Open Market Committee missed knowing by a few hours that the Labor Department would report today that employers' payrolls expanded by 215,000 in June and that the unemployment rate edged lower.

A Slight Figure Seems To Grow and Get Power
Pilar Rioja is by now a New York dance institution with a loyal and loving following, an ensemble of familiar musical collaborators and an atmospheric little home at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, where she performed on Thursday night.
One of the best reasons to see Miss Rioja, who will reopen her engagement at the theater for seven weeks beginning on July 24, is the intimacy and warmth of her program and its setting.
The other reason is that Miss Rioja offers quite a lesson in performing.
There are good dancers and good performers, and sometimes the two are mixed in a single artist.
But with age there is necessarily some loss in the kind of technical facility that helps to make good dancers.
Accommodations must be made, even in flamenco, which can be performed well past the quitting age for most dance techniques.
Miss Rioja has not just made accommodations.
She seems to have seized the chance to explore the realm of performing, at times before one's eyes onstage.


BUSINESS DIGEST
Unemployment Falls As Job Market Grows The job market showed surprising strength in June as employers added 215,000 payroll jobs, and the unemployment rate eased to 5.6 percent.


Screaming About Dogs and Disasters
Courtney Love, leader of the Seattle rock band Hole and widow of Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, has a revenge tactic she likes to use to spite jaded record-company personnel who contribute to on-line computer message boards.
She simply writes the word "paw" followed by a long string of ha-ha's.
The joke is that Paw, from Lawrence, Kan., was one of the first hard-edged alternative-rock bands signed to a major label in the wake of Nirvana's success in 1991.
They went on to receive all the promotional hype that such a band would merit but have yet to receive any success justifying it.
On Tuesday afternoon in Bryant Park, Paw and another band with a Seattle sound, Our Lady Peace, from Toronto, performed a free concert.
Wearing an Uncle Sam costume to celebrate (or perhaps denigrate) Independence Day, Paw's Mark Hennessy screamed lyrics about dogs, disasters and abusive relationships.
The band played the kind of tuneful heavy metal that probably excited record executives looking for the next Nirvana, especially with its sudden shifts from restrained singing to riotous guitar riffing and angrily rasped choruses.
The band slipped a couple of songs from its forthcoming album, "Death to Traitors" (A &amp; M Records), into the set, showing that its songwriting has improved since its first record, "Dragline."


ALUMINUM COMPANY OF AMERICA (AA,N)
The Aluminum Company of America said yesterday that higher metal prices helped quadruple earnings in the second quarter,
Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum producer, earned $219.4 million, or $1.23 a share, in the quarter, up from $45.4 million, or 25 cents, in the comparable quarter a year earlier.
The per-share results for 1994 were restated to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split.


Bond Prices Fall on Data Showing Jobless Rate Drop
Prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday after a stronger-than-expected employment report raised concern that the Federal Reserve might not again cut rates any time soon.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that the nation's unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent in June from 5.7 percent the previous month.
The report even led some bond traders to question if the Fed was justified in cutting short-term interest rates on Thursday.
The Fed lowered its Federal funds target rate, or the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, by 25 basis points, to 5.75 percent.
A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.


Special Olympics Athlete Is Feared Dead
Hundreds of police officers, lifeguards and volunteers waded into cold chest-deep water for up to two hours today off the beach at Hammonasset State Park, holding hands to form a human chain in their search for the body of a 21-year-old mentally retarded athlete from Nepal who disappeared on Thursday while taking a break from the Special Olympics World Games in nearby New Haven.
Ramesh Mali, a soccer player, floundered and disappeared under the water about 60 yards offshore in Long Island Sound around noon Thursday, the state police said.
The Coast Guard announced this morning that it believed Mr.
Mali was dead.
The surface rescue effort was suspended just after 10 A.M. today, with divers and volunteers taking over the search for a body.


Orange County Gets a Reprieve On Paying Debt
A key component of the financial recovery plan for Orange County, Calif., was approved yesterday when a majority of the county's short-term note holders agreed to accept a one-year delay in the repayment of $800 million in debt.
Without this agreement, the county, which filed for bankruptcy protection in December after losing $1.6 billion on risky investments, would have been forced to default immediately on short-term borrowings coming due this month.
The plan, called a "rollover," gives the county an extra year to face these obligations.

Music Contrived To Ease The Angst
As he introduced his songs on Thursday night at Radio City Music Hall, Yanni, the Greek keyboardist and composer of symphonic easy-listening music, said that one song was about romancing life, another about the power of dreams and a third about the bond that exists among all human beings.
These are all healthy and worthwhile ideas, but as Yanni and his 40-piece orchestra played feel-good instrumentals full of ornate but empty virtuosity, the concert began to seem like a musical medicine show.
The snake oil Yanni hawked for three hours on Thursday was advertised to heal the soul.
It was an exotic oil, filled with extracts from far-off lands, from the low didgeridoo piping of Australia to the hot salsa rhythms of Cuba to the close-knit harmonies of South Africa.
Except, like all snake oils and sugar pills, it created only the illusion of healing.
What it actually did was distract -- and, at its most effective, anesthetize -- the listener, blotting out the pain, confusion and conflicts of the world.


Former Baylor Assistants Get Probation
Three former Baylor University assistant basketball coaches embraced and cried tears of joy in a Federal courtroom yesterday as they were sentenced to probation for helping junior college recruits cheat on tests.

Thomas was fined $1,500, while Drummond and Gray were each fined $1,000. (AP)


After Civilians Are Killed, Chechens Break Off Talks
The Chechen delegation broke off peace negotiations today with Russian officials to protest the killing of seven civilians, including two little girls and an old man, by men dressed in Russian uniforms.
The Russian military denied involvement in the killings and said that they were intended to derail the peace talks, which are the most serious effort so far to end the war in the breakaway region in southern Russia.


Donald Sinclair, 84, Inspiration For Herriot's Veterinary Tales
Donald Sinclair, an English country veterinarian who was the model for a character in books by James Herriot, including "All Creatures Great and Small," and in the television series of the same title, died on June 28, The Scotsman, an Edinburgh-based newspaper, reported on Monday.
He was 84 and lived in Thirlby in Yorkshire.
Mr.
Sinclair was the inspiration for Siegfried Farnon, a character who has been called twinkly, avuncular and a bit absent-minded in his television incarnation.


Emilio Nunez Is Dead at 91; A Pioneering Hispanic Judge
Justice Emilio Nunez, who blazed a trail for Hispanic Americans in the judiciary of New York, rising from New York City magistrate to the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court, died on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital.

Nunez, who lived in Manhattan, was 91.
After retiring from the bench in 1977, he returned to the private practice of law as senior counsel to the firm of Sullivan &amp; Liapakis of Manhattan, a post he held at the time of his death.


Leaving Workers Cripple Jersey D.M.V. Units
The long and bitter fight over Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman's plan to privatize motor vehicle offices continued to the last day of state operation today, as disgruntled workers sabotaged computers at five offices and failed to show up in large numbers, leaving six other offices too undermanned to function, authorities said.
The job actions crippled operations at nearly half the 23 branch offices that on Monday will open under private agents and new staffs hired as part of Gov.
Whitman's privatization campaign to save the state $4 million in salary, health benefit and pension costs of D.M.V. workers.


News Media in Belgrade Mute Their Nationalism
As the former Yugoslavia began its descent toward war in the early 1990's, the pro-Government Serbian press played a crucial role in whipping up nationalist fervor and hatred of non-Serbs.
Newspapers were full of vivid stories, many of them exaggerated and others completely false, recounting gruesome atrocities committed against Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia.
Television news programs broadcast propaganda daily, never missing a chance to show a destroyed village, a sobbing widow or a distraught refugee.

A New York City native, he was 71 and had lived in Tarrytown in recent months.
The cause was cancer, his family said.

2 Youths Stole Bus, Police Say, For a Wild Ride in Harlem
Normally, the out-of-service bus would have been parked in a locked yard in Harlem.

Before the new driver could take the wheel, though, two teen-agers stole the 40-foot bus and went on a raucous joy ride through Harlem Thursday night, the police said, smashing into cars and finally running the bus up against a subway entrance.

But two weeks later, Serena's Song bounced back from that defeat to win the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes at Pimlico by nine lengths, and three weeks after that to capture the Mother Goose Stakes at Belmont by three lengths.

In the secondary playoff in Alexandria, Va., on Tuesday, the Alder team won by 62 imps.
Opposing them, after a string of excellent results in the first five days of play, was a group from Seattle: Jean Anderson, Sharon Colson, Janet Dowling, Careen Hinds, Judy Pede and Broma Lou Reed, with Gene Simpson as nonplaying captain.


Doubling Up in Prison Cells Saves Money but Stirs Inmates Anger
Like many inmates throughout New York State's sprawling prison system, Steven Duffen is upset about a new policy to double up inmates in cells designed for one person.
"I'm 6-foot-1 and I weigh 330 pounds," said Mr.
Duffen, a convicted forger imprisoned at the Clinton Correctional Facility near the Canadian border.
"My cell is approximately 6 feet by 8 feet. In that space is a toilet bowl, a sink, a six-foot bed, a tall gym locker and a chair."


Journal; The Middle Ground
If there were any real doubts about where Bill Clinton stands as he runs for re-election, they ended this week.
In a Thursday morning speech delivered at Georgetown University, the President spoke the phrase "middle class" two dozen times and referred nearly as often to his idea of an American "common ground." Middle class, common ground, middle ground, whatever -- the center, as usual in Presidential races, is definitely the place to be.
The discursive, hourlong speech itself was mainly witnessed by C-Span shut-ins and was all too predictably lost in a news cycle in which Marcia Clark, praise be, finally rested her case.
But the significance of Mr.
Clinton's words was advertised by his venue -- G.U., his alma mater, was also the site of his theme-setting "New Covenant" speech for the '92 campaign -- and by his subsequent efforts to get his message out.

Why Can't Tennis Be Like The N.B.A.?
Sports seasons are like great stories.
They begin with an introduction, have a full cast of characters and end with a climax.
Football ends with the Super Bowl, baseball has the World Series, hockey culminates with the Stanley Cup and basketball has the N.B.A. finals.
Tennis, on the other hand, has no season.
It just keeps going and going.
Furthermore, there are dozens of top tournaments all over the world, and the system is set up to favor the top-seeded players.
This isn't good for scrappy new players coming up in the ranks, which means fewer exciting upsets, and that isn't good for the fans.


Fair Funding for New York City Schools
New York State's highest court has agreed to let a legal challenge to the system for financing its public schools go forward.
The case will offer the first serious judicial consideration of the state's unfair school aid formulas in a decade.
Gov.
George Pataki concedes that the formulas need "dramatic changes." He and the State Legislature would do well to jump out ahead of the courts to stop shortchanging many of the state's schoolchildren.


International Briefs; Investors Snap Up Shares of Usinor
Investors sought more than twice as many shares in Usinor Sacilor as the French Government offered as part of the privatization of Europe's largest steelmaker, the Finance Ministry said today.
It said individual investors had oversubscribed the shares reserved for them by 2.1 times and institutional investors oversubscribed the much larger amount of shares set aside for them by 2.35 times.
The privatization will generate just over 17 billion francs ($3.5 billion).

Evidence Is Powerful, but He's Still O.J.
Almost six months ago, prosecutors began the O. J. Simpson murder trial by trying to knock the defendant off his pedestal.
That effort was an implicit acknowledgment that before a jury would consider what prosecutors called the "mountain of evidence" against Mr.
Simpson, they had to drain the deep reservoir of good will he had created for himself on the football field and on the screen.
To most legal experts, the prosecution has produced the mountain it promised, built of DNA evidence and bloody shoe prints, hairs and shirt fibers, carpet threads and reams of testimony.
But as the state concluded its case on Thursday, there were questions as to whether that mountain was big enough, partly, the experts said, because the reservoir of good will still looked intact, even replenished.


An Extra Eye on School Buses
Drivers who pass school buses discharging or picking up children will find themselves appearing on videotape when they go to court.
When school resumes, camera operators will ride Fairview's five buses to capture scofflaws on tape, said David C. Verducci, the School Superintendent.
The decision was prompted by growing complaints that motorists were ignoring the flashing school bus lights.


F.D.A. Approves an Injection To Treat Sexual Impotence
The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the marketing of the first prescription drug for the treatment of impotence, a condition that affects 10 million to 20 million American men.
The drug is administered by injection into the penis shortly before sexual intercourse.
It is not recommended for use more than three times a week or more than once in 24 hours.
Although it is intended for self-administration, "the first injections must be done in a physician's office by medically trained personnel," the F.D.A. said in a statement.


Different Faces of AIDS Are Conjured Up by Politicians
When Senator Jesse Helms explained why he wanted to reduce Federal spending on AIDS care and research, he conjured an image of homosexuals "deliberately engaging in unnatural acts" who had nothing but their own "disgusting, revolting conduct" to blame for contracting the disease.
When President Clinton sought to rebut the Senator, he conjured a different image: that of "Debbie," a 27-year-old woman in a rural area near Orangeburg, S.C., about 75 miles northwest of Charleston, who was served by a county clinic made possible through the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resource Emergency Act of 1990.

Mexican Stock Exchange Is Regaining Lost Ground
The battered Mexican stock market has managed to regain most of the ground it lost after the peso was devalued in December, although stock values in dollar terms are still far below previous levels.
Today, the leading index of the Mexican stock exchange rose for the 11th time in 13 trading days, gaining 54.10 points, or 2.25 percent, to 2,457.18, a high for the year.
While in pesos the market has gained a little more than 1.1 percent since the beginning of the year, in dollars, the exchange is still down more than 18 percent.
The dollar has risen 21.28 percent against the peso for the year.

Unemployment Rates Little Changed in Region
While the national job market showed signs of strength yesterday, employment figures for the New York-New Jersey region were largely stagnant.
The unemployment rate for New York State fell to 5.9 percent in June from 6.3 percent in May.
But New Jersey's unemployment rate rose to 6.6 percent from 6.5 percent, and New York City's rate slipped to 8.1 percent from 8.2 percent.
The national rate fell to 5.6 percent, from 5.7 percent.
The number of people on payrolls remained steady in both states.


Why Banks Have to Remain Impartial Lenders
To the Editor:
In opposing evaluations of the Glass-Steagall laws, Marc Intrater ("Banking Laws Keep an Industry Down," letter, July 2) and John W. Moscow ("Bigger Banks, Bigger Problems," Op-Ed, June 28) focus solely on safety and soundness.
The safety and soundness of our banks and banking system may be important, but it is a peculiarly defensive ground on which to justify or condemn regulation.


CHRONICLE
Call it typecasting.
MOE FONER, 79, who for 35 years was the executive secretary of Local 1199 of the hospital and health care workers' union, and his brother, HENRY FONER, 77, retired president of the Fur, Leather and Machine Workers, are making their movie debuts playing (what else?) labor union leaders.
For the last two days, they have been appearing before cameras in "I'm Not Rappaport," the film version of Herb Gardner's play.
Their scene shows a flashback to the 1909 garment workers' strike and a meeting of such prominent labor leaders as Samuel Gompers.
On the dais with them are the Foner brothers.


Grant S. Lewis, 53, New York Lawyer
Grant S. Lewis, a partner in the law firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &amp; MacRae, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan.
He was 53.
He died after a prolonged illness, said Samuel M. Sugden, the firm's chairman.


Bonilla's Words Serve As Mets' Wake-Up Call
Bobby Bonilla wants to know what's going on. And he's not talking about 1996.
Tonight's comeback from a five-run, seventh-inning deficit may not have changed things for the Mets.
But maybe, just maybe, it's a start.


COMPANY BRIEFS
ITT CORP., New York, announced that its Caesars World casino unit planned to spend about $250 million to add rooms and other amenities to its Atlantic City casino hotel.
PRICELLULAR CORP., New York, said it intended to buy a 98 percent stake in a cellular telephone license owned by Parkersburg Cellular Telephone Co. for $17.5 million.
The license area covers a section of West Virginia and Ohio.


Dodgers' Nomo May Get All-Star Start
If Atlanta's GREG MADDUX cannot start for the National League in the All-Star Game next Tuesday, his choice for a replacement is the Dodgers' HIDEO NOMO.
"I think more people want to watch him pitch than me," said Maddux (8-1), who injured his groin slightly Thursday in the Braves' 1-0 victory over the Dodgers and might miss the All-Star Game at Arlington, Tex.
Nomo is 6-1 and leads the league in strikeouts with 119. (AP)


Subway Train Hits Man
A northbound No. 3 subway train packed with some 1,500 passengers last night struck and killed a man who was crouching on the express tracks of the IRT line just south of Columbus Circle, transit officials said.
The victim, identified only as a black man in his 40's, was dead at the scene, the officials said


A 'New Man' Convicted in an Old Slaying
A former cocaine addict who had turned his life around after murdering a Chelsea lawyer in 1982 was convicted of the crime on Thursday, largely on the basis of a seven-hour videotaped confession made by a dying prisoner.
The defendant, William Seals, 31, and his Jersey City boyhood friend, Kenneth Arch, had followed different paths since their troubled times in the drug world.
In the last decade, Mr.
Seals completed a drug rehabilitation program, married and opened a photo shop in Bayonne, N.J.
But Mr.
Arch became a career criminal, winding up in the Bergen County jail, stricken with AIDS.


International Briefs; Elektrowatt to Buy Electron of Britain
Elektrowatt A.G. of Switzerland said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Electron House P.L.C. of Britain in a merger valued at 115 million Swiss francs, or $100.6 million.
Elektrowatt is an electrical utility and electronics company controlled by the Swiss company CS Holding A.G.


5 Music Giants Drop Plan To Start a Rival to MTV
A tentative plan to start a rival music cable channel to MTV has been dropped by five of the world's biggest music companies.
The companies -- Time Warner, Sony, Thorn EMI, Bertelsmann and Polygram, which is controlled by Philips Electronics -- had planned the service with a partner, the Ticketmaster Corporation.
But executives confirmed yesterday that the plan, which was initially disclosed last year, had been shelved.
The move was reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal.


Open the Packwood Hearings
Senator Bob Packwood told the Senate Ethics Committee this week that he does not want public hearings on the allegations of sexual and official misconduct pending against him.
That is an understandable preference on his part.
But the committee should be guided by the public interest.
It should exercise its right to order an open airing of the evidence against the Senator.
The committee's unanimous report in May -- the equivalent of an indictment -- found "substantial credible evidence" that Mr.
Packwood engaged in a degrading pattern of unwanted sexual advances toward women dating back to 1969, pressed lobbyists for jobs for his wife and tried to obstruct the panel's investigation by tampering with evidence.


Hello to West Brooklyn? Well, Manhattan to You
"EXCUSE me," said Danny Perasa politely to the waitress at the new Brooklyn Diner on 57th Street in Manhattan, "but have you ever heard of Carl Erskine?"
"No, I haven't," said the waitress, who was clearly born years after the old Dodger pitched his last inning.


Rugby Journal; Old School, New Day, With Girl As Head
For generations of British public schoolboys, the "head boy" inspired a respect born largely of fear.
Chosen by the faculty and headmaster to set an example and mete out discipline, he was the most powerful figure in his class, combining the muscular virtue of a church deacon with the authority of a prison warden.
But now that some of the traditional boarding schools have gone coeducational, times are changing.
These days the head boy tries to "communicate" rather than chastise, often chatting up new parents like a junior public relations officer.


Benefits Given Coors Workers' Gay Partners
The Coors Brewing Company, considered by many a bedrock of conservative views, has decided to offer full benefits to employees' unmarried domestic partners, including homosexual companions.
The proposal to extend such benefits was made by a group of Coors employees known as the Lesbian and Gay Resource Group, or Lager.
The company's board approved the change, by unanimous vote, on May 11.
The change was disclosed to Coors employees on June 21.


Leading Academic Hospital, Squeaking by, Seeks Merger
Convinced that it cannot survive on its own in a medical marketplace racked by budget cuts and dominated by managed care, Presbyterian Hospital, one of the city's leading academic hospitals, is actively looking to merge with another medical center.
Executives at Presbyterian, the hospital at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, have begun discussions with two other leading centers, the New York Hospital and New York University Hospital, and hope to cement a partnership within a year, said Dr.
William Speck, President of Presbyterian.


A Charge of Attempted Murder
The 16-year-old wounded by a police officer on Thursday in an exchange of gunfire was charged with attempted murder yesterday, said Lieut.
Bruce Price of the Paterson Police Department.
The youth, whose name was not released, remained in the hospital with a gunshot wound in the arm.
Lieutenant Price said that Officer Jesus Garcia, 31, was on East 18th Street when he heard shots and encountered a group chasing the young man, who had apparently shot at several people during an altercation over a dice game.
The suspect then fired a shot at the officer, who returned fire.


The Next Step in Belfast
The violence that erupted again in Belfast this week was contained and predictable.
The Irish Republican Army seemed to encourage a frustrated community to let off steam after the British Government released Pvt.
Lee Clegg, who was serving a life sentence for killing an Irish teen-ager.
These events should not be allowed to deflect the peace process.
All parties -- the British and Irish Governments and the loyalist and Republican paramilitary groups -- need to find ways to push forward.
One issue stands in the way.
The British Government insists that Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, commit itself to decommissioning the arms of the I.R.A. before all-party talks can begin.
Decommissioning is essential to a peace settlement, but making it a precondition for all-party talks needlessly holds up the negotiating process.


U.S. to Use Fire in Managing Its Lands
A year after deadly wildfires charred the forests of the West, the Clinton Administration has proposed a new policy that would promote the use of fire in managing Federal lands.
The policy emphasizes the natural role of fires in improving the ecological health of overgrown forests, and would use both naturally occurring fires, like those caused by lightning, and controlled fires set wherever land managers determined they would be beneficial.


Attack Victim Leaves Hospital
A Russian Orthodox priest was released from the hospital yesterday after treatment for a gunshot wound suffered when three gunmen kidnapped him in front of his Philadelphia church on Thursday night.
The police said assailants of the Rev.
Mark Schinn, 48, pushed him into his van and drove him across the river to Camden, where they shot him in the back.
"They knew I was a priest," the victim told The Associated Press.
"They were laughing and whooping and having a grand time." The Camden police arrested Jose Casiano, 23; Alfredo DeJesus, 20, and a 15-year-old whose name was withheld.
All were charged with aggravated assault and robbery.
Inside the van, the police found three handguns and a sawed-off shotgun.


Ethics Panel Wants Gingrich to Testify
The House ethics committee wants to hear about Speaker Newt Gingrich's much-debated book deal directly from the two major players.
The committee has called Mr.
Gingrich and Rupert Murdoch, the publishing magnate, to a closed meeting to testify about the agreement they struck for "To Renew America," a book detailing Mr.
Gingrich's views on what direction the country should take.


National Beverage Corp.(POPS,NNM) reports earnings for Year to Apr 29


Nelson Spends Busy First Day With Knicks
With General Manager Ernie Grunfeld behind the wheel, Don Nelson visited the Knicks' practice facility at SUNY-Purchase yesterday.
He proceeded to shake hands with fans, borrow three videocassettes of Knicks games to peruse over the weekend and -- in his spare time -- meet with the former coach Pat Riley's three assistants and assure them they are in no danger of losing their jobs.
During his introduction as the Knicks' 17th coach on Thursday, Nelson said he was "rested and ready to go." But few could have imagined as whirlwind a first day on the job as this one.


Murder Rate Plunges in New York City
In an acceleration of a four-year trend, the murder rate in New York City has plunged sharply since January, to the lowest level in 25 years, according to Police Department statistics.
In the first 25 weeks of the year, reported murders have fallen by nearly a third, to 563 from 826 in the same period last year.
If the trend holds through the rest of the year -- even accounting for the normal surge of summertime mayhem -- 1995 will record the fewest slayings since 1970, when 1,117 people were killed.


Stylistic Opposites Bring a Final of Contrasts to Center Court
It's the battle of the sulky German with the bad back against the bouncing Spaniard with the good attitude and, except for the fact that they have never fought this particular battle at Wimbledon before, it truly is a matter of deja vu all over again for the female finalists Saturday.
For the 14th straight time, Steffi Graf, the world's top-ranked woman, is facing Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in a tournament final.
The last time they met, Graf reclaimed the French Open title, and the No. 1 ranking, with a 7-5, 4-6, 6-0 victory in Paris that also brought her a 16th Grand Slam singles crown.


Arrest Is Made in Brooklyn Shotgun Blast
The police arrested an 18-year-old Brooklyn man last night in connection with a Fourth of July shotgun blast that wounded a 6-year-old girl and seven men who were playing dominoes on a Bushwick sidewalk.
The man, David Ratliff, who lives at 62 Covert Street in Bushwick, was charged with reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon, said Detective Mark Patterson of the New York City Police Department.

GOLF  Haas Grabs Lead by 2
Jay Haas birdied the final two holes yesterday to take the second-round lead in the Western Open in Lemont, Ill., while Paul Azinger moved into contention with what he considered his best PGA Tour round since beginning his comeback from cancer 11 months ago.
Haas, who trailed Tom Watson by one stroke after the opening round, shot a four-under-par 68 for a two-day total of seven-under 137.
Watson was two back along with Steve Lowery.
Azinger, diagnosed with lymphoma in his right shoulder at the end of his outstanding 1993 season, had five birdies and no bogeys in shooting a 67 and was at 141.
"I really feel like I'm all the way back," he said.
Tiger Woods, the 19-year-old United States Amateur champion, shot a 71 for a 145 total.
Woods is playing his first event since withdrawing from the United States Open with a wrist injury. (AP) 64 FOR HILL: Mike Hill shot a seven-under-par 64 to take a two-shot lead after the first round of the $900,000 Kroger Senior Classic in Mason, Ohio. (AP) TRACK  Ankle Foils Record Bid

Grand Prix meet in London.
But a slight left ankle strain stopped him after his winning third jump of 58- 1/2.
In other events, Steve Backley edged the world and Olympic champion Jan Zelezny with a javelin throw of 290-6; Jamaica's Merlene Ottey won the women's 200 meters in 22.32 seconds and Canada's Donovan Bailey won the 100 in 10.16. (AP)


Islet Lore: Soldiers, Prisoners, the Rich, the Dead and, Perhaps, the Devil
There are 20 islands in and around Long Island Sound that are within the borders of the Bronx.
The islands were once known as the Devil's Stepping Stones; according to fable, Indians were chasing the Devil across the sound, and every time he put his cloven hoof down, an island was formed.
Most of the islands are little more than unpopulated, rocky outcroppings, but others have rich histories.

Train Service To Stamford

Manhattan Renters Find Tighter Market
MOBILITY is theoretically the beauty of renting.
There's no need to worry about selling in order to relocate.
But what if there's nothing much out there to rent?
Inveterate renters who insist on staying in Manhattan -- to say nothing of outsiders relocating to the city -- are finding shrinking availabilities and higher prices these days.
The situation was foreseeable, and widely foreseen, even five years ago during the depth of the doldrums in the real-estate market.
It was a buyer's market then in sales as well as rentals.
But gradually vacancies were absorbed.


Spanning the Parks
Sports Tours gives new meaning to the term seventh-inning stretch, with trips for baseball fans that stretch all over the United States and Canada.
The company's tours include tickets to three to seven major league games, accommodations and transportation between stadiums.

Her mother teaches mathematics at the Robert Finley Middle School in Glen Cove, L.I.


A Winning Artist at the Ives Center
MANY young artists have risen to fame on the wings of international prizes, but competitions are not the only road to recognition.
Emerging instrumentalists are also grateful for the Avery Fisher Awards, where the recipients are chosen by peer recommendations rather than by specific audition; a similar method guides the selection process at the Marian Anderson Awards for singers.
Since 1990, when Ms.
Anderson herself attended the awards concert, the winning artists have been presented at the Charles Ives Center for the Arts, and at 8 P.M.
Saturday, the tradition continues with a showcase introduction to the 1994 laureate, Patricia Racette.
The concert circumstances are quite different this year, though: instead of singing a group of arias the soprano will be featured as Violetta in a concert version of Verdi's "Traviata."

Rifle Association Can't Deliver on Promises to Life Members
To the Editor:
Re the June 26 front-page article on the financial situation at the National Rifle Association ("Aggressive Strategy by N.R.A. Has Left Its Finances Reeling"):


Correction
A report in the Travel Advisory column on June 18 about tours to Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., referred incorrectly to the cost of a box lunch on New York Waterway's day cruises.
The lunch is not included in the $50 price of a cruise; it is an additional $9.50.


Get Out of Town
To the Editor:
I fail to see the new charms of Paris as described by Herbert Muschamp in "The New Paris: Growing Accustomed to Its Face"  [ June 18 ] .
The recent spate of building, inspired by the monarchal whims of French political leaders intent on leaving their imprint on Paris, has resulted in a series of architectural monstrosities.
Most notable has been the Pompidou Center, mercifully distant from the glorious Champs-Elysees.


Corrections
A map last Sunday showing the site of a gathering of hippies who call themselves the Rainbow Family misspelled the name of the locale and the name of a nearby town in some editions.
As noted in the article, the site was Carson National Forest in New Mexico, not Carlson, and the town was Vallecitos, not Vallectos.

'Family Values'
To the Sports Editor:
It seems to be a stretch to see Mickey Mantle as a symbol of post-war America, "early summer afternoon in the American century," as Robert Lipsyte describes it ("Mantle and America: Allies in Vulnerability," The Times, June 11).
More apropos, I think, is to see the reality of his life as the seamy underside of the 1950's family perfection that is much extolled by today's right wing.

I agree with Richard Taruskin that musical works can have their own political content and that listeners should be skeptical of such political "messages." But his solution -- that works with whose political messages he disagrees should be buried -- is exactly the fate meted out to the works of Weill, Hindemith and others in Nazi Germany.


Summary of Major Actions in the Legislature's 218th Session
The 218th session of the New York State Legislature opened in January with a plea from Gov.
George E. Pataki for more open government and bipartisan cooperation.
It ended at 5 A.M. on June 30 after 26 weeks of backroom maneuvering and sustained partisan squabbling.
Mr.
Pataki, a Republican, scored an early victory when he signed the death penalty into law on March 7 after several weeks of difficult negotiations that soured his relationship with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat.


Charting What Lies at the Bottom of the Sound
WHAT'S out there, under water in Long Island Sound?
How did it get there?
What's happening with it?
How do we know?
"All you can see is water, and the seagulls aren't talking," Ralph S. Lewis said.
But it's his job to answer such questions, so early one rainy morning he was at the University of Connecticut's dock in Noank, boarding a boat loaded with "fish," a "pinger" and other equipment.
"These are called fish. They're the on-deck part of the side-scan sonar, the system that allows us to get pictures of the bottom," he said, stepping around two torpedo-shaped devices and the winch that would lower them, on a cable, from the deck of the 46-foot Asterias.
Nearby was the pinger, "a very high-powered bottom finder." He noted that the side-scan sonar does indeed look sideways, along the top of the sediment, while the pinger looks down, into the sediment -- and both devices operate by sending out sound and getting it back.


SUMMER SOLACE
SOME HOUSES BREAK ALL THE RULES OF decorating and look the better for it.
A slope-roofed cottage in the Hamptons is a lesson in the art of un-decorating.
Fabrics don't match; pictures aren't framed.
The antiques are so numerous, some are left propped against walls.
The colors aren't even coordinated.
But they are as luminous and bright as summer itself.
The blue is the blue of dawn; the green looks as if it were skimmed off a pond.


Cold Soups That Lift Summer Appetites
SUMMER demands cold soup.
What could be more colorful, flavorful and refreshing for heat-flagged appetites?
And what a boon for the cook.
Cold soups can be made in advance and need only minimal attention before serving.

For Macaronis, a Big Wig Was Just Dandy
To the Editor:
In " '. . . And Called Him Macaroni' " (editorial, July 4), on the roots of "Yankee Doodle," you ask whether a macaroni is in fact an "it" or a "him."


Parisians' Summer Getaway
SAY "Belle-Ile" with a lilt and you're chanting a favorite French mantra for peace of mind.
Beginning in May, and continuing through October, every couple of hours the ferryboat Guerveur crosses the Bay of Biscay to disgorge a hundred passengers in the island's main port of Le Palais.
Almost all of them, it seems, buy the makings of a picnic lunch, rent a bicycle and set off in search of 5,000-year-old Celtic standing stones and panoramic views.
In what amounts to a miracle of distribution, Belle-Ile -- about 11 by 5 miles at its widest -- absorbs them all without sacrificing its sunny character.
About a five-and-a-half hour trip from Paris, Belle-Ile has long been the Parisian's summer getaway, ever since the revels of Nicolas Fouquet, Minister of Finance for Louis XIV, in the island's main town of Le Palais.
Today it is home to a world-class thalassotherapy spa, the Hotel Castel Clara at Port Goulphar, that draws the Range Rover crowd.
But there's nothing exclusive about the island's beaches, cliff walks, flowering moors and Breton villages.


A Feline Friend Is Gone, Sprightly Whiskers and All
To The Editor:
What a shock to read my favorite cat's obituary, "Mr. Bigelow, 18: Cool Cat, Poor Mouser" (June 18).

Bigelow.


Autry and Angels' Year May Turn Out to Be Year of the Indian
Is it Gene Autry's fate that when the California Angels seem surprisingly good enough to reach the World Series for the first time the Cleveland Indians have put together an awesome team after 40 mostly miserable years?
The Indians, with only 11 winning seasons since winning 111 games in 1954, entered yesterday's games with a 12-game lead in the American League's Central Division.
The last time a team had that big or bigger a lead at the All-Star break was in 1986, when the Mets led the National League East by 13 games.

Efforts to Legalize DEET Products Blocked
For the second time in six weeks, a State Supreme Court justice has blocked the Pataki administration's efforts to legalize the sale of insect repellents with high concentrations of the chemical DEET.
The temporary restraining order issued by Justice Joseph C. Teresi on Friday means that repellents with high concentrations of DEET will remain illegal in New York State, said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who has been challenging the state's policies on DEET.

Honor for Life's Work Buoys Gay Advocate
Dr.
Henry D. Messer was receiving a lifetime achievement award at the annual gay and lesbian Pride Banquet in Detroit on June 15.
But he felt a protest was in order.
"Wait a minute," said the 67-year-old retired neurosurgeon, who joined the homosexual civil rights movement in the early 1960's and is now treasurer of the Triangle Foundation, a gay and lesbian advocacy group he helped found.
"My lifetime ain't over yet."

EARNING IT &lt;HEADLINEA Champion of the Technically Challenged and Overwhelmed
AT first blush, it's your basic Silicon Valley success story: brash, 30-something executive markets breakthrough product and leads tiny company to fame and profit.
Then again, there's a lot in the tale of John J. Kilcullen and the " . . . for Dummies" publishing phenomenon that could have come straight from Broadway.
For starters, take the concept itself -- a line of how-to computer and personal finance books written specifically for people willing to admit, indeed to glory, in their own ignorance and technophobia.
Major booksellers and publishers, who said readers wouldn't buy books about their inadequacies, now clamor to stock or to imitate the bright yellow and black paperback volumes that take the side of people challenged by the complexities of modern life, making the series "a reference for the rest of us."


Mo Vaughn: Still Smiling After All These Years
For someone who has known him for almost 20 years, there is one enduring image of Maurice (Mo) Vaughn, the slugging first baseman of the Boston Red Sox: that of a roly-poly 9-year-old, forever smiling, whether at bat or in the field, and launching prodigious drives at the Honeyhill School Little League diamond in Norwalk, Conn.
Nowadays, the perpetual smile is gone, replaced by a serious mien and an almost menacing look that bespeaks Vaughn's intensity as one of baseball's brightest new stars, one who began the weekend tied for the major league lead in home runs, with 24, and runs batted in, with 59.
Deep down, though, he said recently, he's still having nearly as much fun as he did while playing in the Cranbury Little League in his hometown of Norwalk.

Iraq Asks Delay on Destroying Missile-Linked Machinery
Less than a week after Iraq confessed to producing large quantities of biological weapons in the years just before the Persian Gulf war, it is asking the United Nations Security Council to delay enforcing a demand that it destroy machinery that could be used to make ballistic missiles.
In a letter to the Council today, Iraq's representative at the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, said that the Government of President Saddam Hussein had told a team monitoring the dismantling of all its weapons of mass destruction that it wanted to put off a final decision on five pieces of machinery "until the biological file is disposed of positively."


A Breakdown On the Highway To the Moon
Species Ben Kingsley, Natasha Henstridge, Michael Madsen Directed by Roger Donaldson R 111 minutes
When scientists fabricate a segment of D.N.A. from instructions sent from outer space and combine that with a human egg, they create Sil, the half-female, half-alien creature they keep ina secret lab.
Sil (in human form, Ms. Henstridge) escapes and specialists give chase.
The problem is that in weeks Sil matures from a young girl to a grown woman, eager to reproduce.
And she has a nasty temper when crossed.


A Photographic Message That Feeds Stereotypes
To The Editor
I have been trying to figure out the point behind the July 2 Photographer's Journal, which shows a group of black boys in Paterson looking out at the reader from behind bars.
While the boys seem playful and none of them is more than 7 or 8 years old, the setting has the unmistakable look of a jail.


Starting Today For TV Viewers in the City
The Times's Television section now provides channel numbers for the five New York City cable systems, making it easier to find the programs you choose to watch.
The channel numbers appear on the left side of the grid under each station's call letters, and a key on the bottom of each left-hand page lists the cable companies.
The order and typeface of the numbers in the grid correspond to the order and typeface in the key.
Once you find which number works for your cable company - say, the second number (16 for A&amp;E or 32 for AMC) - use the number in that spot for each channel.
The section also offers:  Listing for six additional cable channels: Comedy Central, the Cartton Network, E!
Entertainment, the Learning Channel, the Sci-Fi Channel and VH1.
Expanded movie listings, on consecutive pages.
A cover story and frequently and additional article on the back page.

Nuclear Deal With Russia Is Reshaped
Major progress has been made in repairing an East-West deal in which the nuclear material from thousands of Russian warheads is to be transformed into a peaceful bonanza of nuclear energy, Federal officials say.
But private experts assert that the undertaking is still in doubt and might fall apart.
The deal, hammered out three years ago after the Soviet Union collapsed, would have the United States pay Russia $12 billion for diluting 500 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium from nuclear arms into reactor fuel that would be used for generating electricity in America.
The deal was hailed as a significant step in reducing the risk that bomb ingredients could be stolen in Russia and sold to terrorists or to countries seeking to develop a bomb.


Surveilling Maskirovka
IN "BETRAYAL: THE STORY OF Aldrich Ames, an American Spy," three of my New York Times colleagues in Washington explore the tangled-web world of deception.
Quoting the Civil War General Thomas (Stonewall) Jackson's strategic advice to "mystify, mislead and surprise," the authors -- Tim Weiner, David Johnston and Neil A. Lewis -- note that the craft of misleading "was deeply respected within the K.G.B., which had an entire branch devoted to maskirovka, or deception techniques."
What a beautiful word, pronounced mas-kir-OAF-ka.
The United States Army's 1955 Glossary of Soviet Military Terminology defines maskirovka as "camouflage; concealment; disguise." Leo Carl's 1990 International Dictionary of Intelligence agrees that it was a World War II term for camouflage, but takes it into the modern intelligence era by defining it as "Soviet G.R.U. jargon for deception," and notes that the Soviet Military Encyclopedia divides maskirovka into "strategic, operational and tactical deception."

Habitats/38th Street; The View From 54
THERE is a perfection in the scene: an ideal match.

First, take a handsome, hard-working young doctor whose name is -- yes, really -- Doug Noble.


Two Collectors Bound by Marriage But Not by Tastes
ABOVE THE SINK IN THE KITCHEN of Marilynn and Ivan Karp's 150-year-old farmhouse outside this upstate New York city hang rows of food choppers, beaters and graters.
The walls in one bathroom are covered with boldly graphic tin signs hawking products of a century ago.
Other parts of the house contain collections of painted country furniture, quilts, maps and old photographs.
And hidden away in drawers are root beer mugs and old medicine bottles.
The Karp's marriage in 1963 brought together their disparate possessions.
"My dowry was my collections," said Mrs.
Karp.
"The Coca-Cola trays were mine, the tools were his, the marbles were mine, the stoneware crocks were his. We shared and got into each other's fantasies."


PRESENT SHOCK
I enjoyed Claudia Dreifus's article "Present Shock" (June 11), on Third Wave futurists Alvin and Heidi Toffler and their relationship with Newt Gingrich.
However, I was struck by Ms.
Toffler's comment that Gingrich is obviously tolerant because he hasn't disowned his lesbian sister.


Cowboys Are Back in the Saddle, But Only for About 8 Seconds or So
Every summer Saturday night, there is a rodeo at Cowtown Arena near Woodstown, a farming community in Salem County.
Although some of the contestants are local, the contest is not: Cowtown is on the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association circuit, and the top money-winners go to national finals in Pocatello, Idaho, and Las Vegas in the fall.
On a typical evening, the top bronco rider will make $800 for an eight-second ride.
The audience of 3,000 or so sit on bleachers or on covered boxes marked Chestnutt Hill Farms or WFK Trucking or Woodstown Ice and Coal and watch handsome men with very short hair, white hats and P.R.C.A.-regulation long-sleeve shirts ride bucking broncos and bulls, rope calves, and wrestle steer to the ground.
Cowgirls compete in the barrel race, a three-cornered obstacle course for horses.


The Magic in Bad Penmanship
THE two bookstores could not be more different.
Barnes &amp; Noble, at Fifth Avenue and 48th Street, boasts some 150,000 computer-inventoried titles.

"The Little Princess" is the 1939 version of Frances Hodgson Burnett's tale, with boarding school when her father goes to war.
Also part of this series is "The Little Colonel," with Miss Temple as the stubborn Miss Lloyd Sherman, who lives with her irascible grandfather (Lionel Barrymore) in Kentucky in the 1870's.


Inspired By the Produce Of Portland
IF a city could be designed by chefs, Portland might be the result.
Ringed by mountains, pristine rivers, woods and fields, and the Pacific Ocean, Oregon is a virtual food laboratory.
"I can't believe the products that we get from farmers every day," said Philippe Boulot, the former chef at the Mark Hotel in Manhattan who recently moved to Portland's Heathman Hotel.
His current menu features local products like Oregon morels, local bay shrimp, native salmon, fresh game and arugula that is still glistening with morning dew.

Famous in France. Just Another Plain Face in the U.S.
IT IS PROBABLY FORTUNATE that Michel Blanc thinks it would be tedious to play "the handsome, positive, conquering, courageous, screen hero." Being short, a trifle puny and very bald, the 43-year-old French actor hasn't been given that option.
"I can't step in for Paul Newman, and he can't step in for me, so that's fine," he said.
Instead, he has carved himself a niche.
By playing self-deprecating anti-heroes in a series of French film comedies and dramas, Mr.
Blanc has found his appearance working to his advantage.
"He has always played the tiny, poor little guy who suffers because he is ugly," said Carole Bouquet, his co-star in "Grosse Fatigue," which opens in New York on Friday.
"He's extremely well known for those parts. People say 'poor Michel.' "


New in This Section
This issue of Televison introduces some new features and some improvements on familiar ones.
You'll find channel numbers for New York City cable systems on the left side of each grid, making it easier to find the program you choose.
You may have to test them.
Once you find which number works for your cable company - say, the second from left (16 for A&amp;E and 32 for AMC) - use the number in that spot for each channel.


Essaying a Musical Role 'That Wreaks Havoc'
IN "Splendora," a musical that will have its premiere at the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor on Wednesday, Joan Copeland plays a role that in some ways feels familiar.
"I often am asked to play parts that wreak havoc," Ms.
Copeland said, flashing a wicked smile in a conversation in her apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.


Science Fiction
It may be just coincidence that Orson Scott Card has completed his grandly conceived Homecoming Saga in five books, the same number as the Torah.
Then again it may not.
Mr.
Card, a practicing Mormon, has always been dead serious about the religious under pinnings of his science fiction -- which, for all its trappings of space travel and sentient computers, might more accurately be labeled "conscience fiction." EARTHBORN (Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95), like the previous volumes in the Homecoming series, takes as its theme what moral philosophers call right action: how to live in an imperfect world without violating one's own moral principles.


Bumping
To the Editor: As travelers who have often received vouchers, or cash or both in return for agreeing to be bumped from flights my wife and I agree with all but one of Betsy Wade's suggestions in "Passengers Play the Airlines' Bumping Game" (Practical Traveler, May 21).
That suggestion was that would-be volunteers not check bags ahead of time.
Whenever we plan to volunteer for bumping we check our luggage but take a small carry-on bag with necessities for an overnight stay.
This way, we minimize handling our luggage, and when we finally arrive at our destination our bags are waiting.


A Mover of Markets
The red digital clock pulses 12:30:00, and Dan Dorfman's image beams into this smooth and sterile control room of the CNBC cable network like some sort of wayward space alien disrupting a NASA launch.
It's six minutes until Dorfman, a columnist for Money magazine, presents his daily dose of stock market news, rumors and tips on CNBC.
A technician has switched on a remote camera in Dorfman's office at Money, and the small, balding man with black electric tape eyebrows appears on a control-room monitor scribbling furiously on a legal note pad.
At 12:34, Dorfman is writing away as CNBC gives its regular update on the O. J. Simpson trial.
When the clock blinks 12:36, Kevin McCullough, the gray-haired anchor, introduces Dorfman.


Los Angeles Schools Go in Summer
While many students were enjoying the uninterrupted liberty of long summer days, students here at Garfield High School began the '95-'96 school year on Wednesday.

July 2-8: Too Cheap to Sell?; A Vitamin Theory For Curbing Heart Disease
In a world of expensive drugs, it may be almost too much to believe that a vitamin costing pennies a day might also prevent heart disease.
But with the rediscovery of a long-ignored hypothesis, the vitamin theory of heart disease is ascendant.
Yet there seems little commercial incentive to explore its implications.


Island Woos Visitors to Ease Budget Crunch
Thousands of New Yorkers gathered on Manhattan rooftops and the East River Drive to watch last week's Fourth of July fireworks display, but arguably the best view in the city was from a little-known spot on Roosevelt Island.
Nearly 2,400 people paid $10 apiece for a seat with a view on the southern tip of the island across the river from the United Nations.
The event was simply the latest in a burst of recent public activity on Roosevelt Island, with a serious purpose: finding ways to bring in money to make up for that lost to state budget cuts.
In 1994, $1.6 million of the island's $9.2 million operating budget came from the state.
This year, the state reduced its contribution to just over $1 million.


Video on the Road
To the Editor: I write about the paragraph on Budget Rent a Car's Autovisions video-tape player on the Travel Advisory page on May 28.
Parents who rely on devices such as Autovisions to occupy their kids during a road trip effectively cancel instructive conversations and enjoyable teaching about the trip the family is taking and the sights the car is passing.


Ruth Reichl's Picnic Menu: Not What a Doctor Orders
To The Editor:
If the Ruth Reichl writing in "Experts Pick The Ways (and Wheres) to Picnic" (July 2) is The New York Times's restaurant reviewer, HELP!
She serves up everything the doctor wouldn't order -- junk food to go from the city's street vendors.
And the smell from their carts in the heat of summer is enough to make one ill, especially after looking at the hands of the "chef" you picture.
Ruth Reichl, you should be ashamed -- some picnic.

Battle Over Kashmir Seems Only to Worsen
From sandbagged bunkers that line the winding streets in this old city, Indian troops watch nervously for the enemy: Muslim separatist guerrillas who dart forward, tossing grenades or loosing bursts of automatic fire before vanishing into the bazaars.
For India, ruling Kashmir has come down to something much like an occupation: an army and police force of at least 300,000, bunkers everywhere, search operations that paralyze daily life and shoot-to-kill orders.
Kashmiri human rights groups say two-thirds of the 30,000 people killed in the five-year conflict have been civilians.

Rubber Trees Being Planted in Brazil, the Source
A thousand miles from the Amazon, a new chapter in Brazil's rubber epic is being written in modern plantations where rubber trees are planted like corn.
Defying history and Henry Ford, the plantations are thriving, placing Brazil back on the road to self-sufficiency in rubber for the first time since 1950.
A century ago Brazil controlled the entire world's rubber supply.

Yikes! Roger Corman Is Back, Still
THE human brain cannot tolerate a steady diet of high-class entertainment.
This is a proven scientific fact, and it is the reason that Roger Corman is still around after 40 years of cranking out low-budget shockers like "The Pit and the Pendulum," "Not of This Earth," "A Bucket of Blood" and "She Gods of Shark Reef."
His name, synonymous with the cheap thrill, is the official schlock seal stamped on the 13 horror and science-fiction movies that make up "Roger Corman Presents," a weekly series that begins on Showtime on Tuesday at 9:30 P.M. with "Suspect Device." The series can be thought of as a kind of virtual drive-in, just in time for the summer season.


Jennifer A. Brown And Neal J. Simon
Jennifer Amy Brown, a daughter of Linda and Stephen Brown of New York, was married last evening to Neal Jerry Simon, a son of Sylvia and Donald Simon of New York.

Her father is a vice president and the senior counsel at Champion International, the paper company in Stamford, Conn.
Her mother teaches art at Public School 117 in Briarwood, Queens.


Who's Being Disgusting on AIDS?
It is no surprise that Senator Jesse Helms is seeking to inflame passions over the AIDS crisis and pit one American versus another in a fight over how to allocate Federal health funding.
The pity is that Republican leaders in Congress have been slow to challenge him.
The North Carolina Republican displayed his customary malice in slowing action on a Federal funding bill for the care and treatment of people with AIDS.
That bill, known as the Ryan White Care Act, would extend programs that currently allocate $633 million for AIDS treatment around the nation, including some $70 million in New York, mostly for outpatient care for uninsured people.
This worthy legislation deserves passage despite Mr.
Helms's maneuvers.


MOVIES THIS WEEK
THREE Hollywood stalwarts strut their stuff in two films each on television this week.
John Barrymore devours his roles in Harry D'Arrast's TOPAZE (1933) and Howard Hawks's TWENTIETH CENTURY (1934) like juicy pomegranates.
Both pictures are highlights of Hollywood's golden era.
In the droll "Topaz" (from Marcel Pagnol's play), he's a naive Paris pedagogue who learns corporate wiles, turns rich mogul and calmly annexes a victim's mistress (the charming Myrna Loy).
Barrymore's gradual transformation and the film's sly ironies are enthralling - Thursday at 1:30 P.M. on American Movie Classics.
In the raffish "Twentieth Century" he lets fly hilariously with tasty, ham-spiced flamboyance as a Broadway egomaniac, matched every step of the way by Carole Lombard, as his ex-mistress.
Here is one co-starring duo straight from heaven (via Hecht-MacArthur's stage hit) - Saturday/Early Sunday at 12:05 A.M. on Channel 13.


Amanda Stebbins, Charles Sharpless
Amanda Lee Stebbins, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
John W. Stebbins of Newtown, Mass., was married yesterday to Charles Maxwell Sharpless, the son of Dr.

The bridegroom graduated from the University of Michigan and received a law degree from Georgetown University.


News Media Concentration Takes Its Toll on Workers
To the Editor:
The problems discussed in your July 2 article "In Jersey Journal Labor Fight, Publishing Giant Has All the Cards" reflect larger national problems.
One is the continuing concentration of the news media.
The Jersey Journal, which is run by the Newhouse chain, in the recent past swallowed its smaller long-time competitor The Hudson Dispatch.
Some years earlier, the other paper in the chain, The Star-Ledger of Newark, swallowed and eliminated The Newark News.


Get Rid of Corporate Welfare
Not since Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in 1969 has the Federal budget been in balance.
Inertia propelled Apollo 11 through space to the moon.
The Federal budget is similarly subject to the forces of nature.
Once set in motion, Government programs tend to keep on going, regardless of their utility, fairness or importance.
Achieving a balanced budget by the year 2002 depends on an unyielding commitment to scrutinize each program every year.


Rented Space Buys Trouble For a Business
In a city where all kinds of businesses operate next to each other or share space in blissful ignorance, peaceful coexistence is occasionally punctured when the notoriety of one neighbor spills over onto the next.
Take the case of Terri Ash, a retired teacher who runs a small travel agency called Travel Plans Unlimited.
For four years, Ms.
Ash quietly sold package deals to Mexico and the Caribbean from the office she rents in the back of Park West Realty on Seventh Avenue.


Glorious Shade
To the Editor: Ah! What refreshingly cool words in W. D. Wetherell's breezy end-piece.
As for the ranking of shade trees, my International Book of Trees (Hugh Johnson) lists more "broadleafs" than "conifers," but this includes European trees.
However, all maples are indeed most restorative in shading.
But surely the palmate leaves of the horse chestnut also give beautiful shade.
As children, we used them as fans.
A hammock between two trees made the entire area "air-conditioned."


Stray Dogs Wounded in Attacks
Curly was stabbed two months ago, Larry was bludgeoned last month, and Moe was sliced up two weeks ago.
The three injured dogs with the Three Stooges names had roamed the neighborhood in peace for years, fed most nights by John Contino, a Coney Island dog lover who feeds strays and runs Mighty Mutts, a nonprofit animal adoption agency. .
Mr.
Contino discovered their wounds on his nightly feeding rounds.


The Nation; Congress, Spare Our Benefits or Else
HOME last week for the Fourth of July recess, Democratic senators and representatives made the rounds of senior citizen clubs and retirement communities.
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, for example, went to a seniors' meeting in Monroe Township and retirement homes in Cliffside Park and Dover Township.
Rhode Island's Democratic Congressmen, Patrick J. Kennedy and Jack Reed, went to community centers for the elderly in 10 towns across the state.
Their message was basic: The Republicans in Congress are out to demolish Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.


Step 1 for a Rustic Trellis: Find Some Woods
I am making rustic trellises for my roof garden in Brooklyn, from the jungle of vines and trees that border the stream on our family farm in Maryland.
It felt like the Amazon there last week, as I cut my way through briars and wild roses one muggy afternoon best suited for skinny-dipping in the cold creek.
But no, there I was in long pants and a long-sleeved shirt, sturdy shoes and socks, and heavy work gloves, yanking on grapevines that twined 40 feet up into the walnut trees, and doing a little judicious pruning of the willows along the stream bank.
Wild grapevines and young willow shoots are easily bent into the loops so familiar to rustic designs.
I was also on the lookout for saplings or prunable branches of maple, locust, walnut, sycamore or whatever else I could find for the posts and crosspieces.
I carried pruners, a handsaw and loppers to gather my materials, and to disentangle myself from the wild rose canes. (This is why you can't run, skimpily clad and unarmed, into a Maryland woods in deep summer. Unless you want to be attacked by briars and fall howling into the poison ivy.)


Graboski Recalled
To the Sports Editor:
Recent articles dealing with Kevin Garrett mention only Moses Malone, Darryl Dawkins and Bill Willoughby as players who went directly from high school into the pros.
But Joe Graboski went directly from high school to the Chicago Stags of the Basketball Association of America for the 1948-49 season. (The B.A.A. became the N.B.A. in 1949-50 after a merger with the National Basketball League.) Graboski had a rather successful career in the N.B.A., averaging 11 points per game over 13 seasons.

Cone Beans McGwire As Blue Jays Batter A's
Blue Jays 9, Athletics 6
The beaning of the Oakland star Mark McGwire and the ejection of two pitchers yesterday overshadowed Paul Molitor's two-run homer in the seventh inning that broke a tie and led the Toronto Blue Jays to a 9-6 victory over the host Athletics in the opener of a doubleheader.
After McGwire was hit by a David Cone pitch in the third inning, Oakland pitchers Doug Johns and Mike Harkey were ejected for throwing at Blue Jays hitters, and both benches emptied in the seventh after Joe Carter was hit by a pitch two batters after Molitor's sixth home run broke a 3-3 tie.
There were no fights.


Diana K. Telling, Paul S. Riske

In One Part Of Bronx, Gunfire Has Eased
When Clark Fleming first arrived in the Bronx four years ago, robbers preyed on his building at 170th Street and Morris Avenue, drug dealers prowled the streets and gunshots echoed through the nights.
"Every night by my window I was terrified," said Dr.
Fleming, who grew up in Lynchburg, S.C., and finished his medical residency in New York.
"I would hear gunshots and see drug deals going on."


July 2-8; Pork Over the Pentagon
The Pentagon and politics, never far apart, wound a little tighter last week.
Defense Department officials crafted a plan to save jobs at a large California Air Force base and political face for Bill Clinton in a state with 54 electoral votes that is crucial to his re-election hopes.


AIDS and Ryan White
To the Editor:
I was saddened to read that Senator Jesse Helms is against the full funding of the Ryan White Care Act ("Helms Puts the Brakes to a Bill Financing AIDS Treatment," news article, July 5) because, he said, "deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct" is responsible for those with AIDS.
Does the Senator not know that Ryan White contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion, as did Arthur Ashe?

A Flat Tax: Is It a Threat To Retirees' Security?
PROPOSALS for a flat tax -- one with a uniform low rate and few deductions -- have raised two big worries among the public.
Will a flat tax do away with the deduction for home mortgage interest?
And will it cripple the municipal bond market, where tax-free returns are the main attraction?
To get answers, taxpayers must await the outcome of the political debate over this issue.
But, as they wait, they can add a third, underpublicized concern to list: the fate of their golden years.


Lisa Jan Finkler, Stephen Bandler
Lisa Jan Finkler, the daughter of Barbara and Martin Finkler of Pomona, N.Y., was married yesterday evening to Stephen Joseph Bandler, a son of Sandra and James Bandler of New York.
Rabbi Harvey Tattelbaum performed the ceremony at the Dellwood Country Club in New City, N.Y.


Do the Movies Get New York Right?
"I ACTUALLY feel pretty comfortable in New York," says a man with a tumble of curls and a deadpan delivery, as he leans against the counter of local cigar store.
"I get scared, like, in Sweden." He has his reasons.
Sweden is that frightening country where "it's kind of empty" and "everything works." What self-respecting New Yorker would want to live in a place like that?
That unnamed man has an attitude city dwellers can identify with, and the strange thing is that it comes from a movie.
"Blue in the Face" (opening in October) is a spinoff of the current "Smoke," set in the same congenial store in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn.
A plotless series of anecdotes, "Blue in the Face" is a valentine to the voices of New York.
That the local man is played by Lou Reed (whose voice is more familiar for singing, "Hey, babe, take a walk on the wild side") only enhances his credentials as a guy with a broad view of New York's possibilities.

Because of an editing error, a chart with a front-page article on June 11 about the difficulties in filling two vacancies on the Securities and Exchange Commission, referred incorrectly to Isaac C. Hunt Jr., one of the leading candidates for commissioner.
He was not the first black to have graduated from the University of Virginia Law School; John F. Merchant, who graduated in 1958, was the first.


At Peace in the Lonely Realm of the Oboe
THE MUSIC WORLD, EVERYONE CALLS IT, as if it were one big, amorphous body of like-minded, similarly skilled fiddlers and pipers.
In fact, it is an unwieldy agglomeration of highly specialized enterprises, each a world unto itself.
Thus the stereotypes and thinly veiled antagonisms that flourish within orchestras, spawning viola jokes and, more recently, trombone jokes.
Few worlds are as mysterious even to other instrumentalists as that of the oboe.
Oboists are indeed a breed apart, a closed society of craftsmen-musicians, subject even more than their fellow reed players (clarinetists and bassoonists) to the fickle favors of a fragile medium: cane.
"You don't have to be crazy to play the oboe, but it helps," goes an old saw in the trade.


On Sunday; For 3 Rabbis, 2-Way Street Turns to Maze

Clothes That Aren't to Die For
WHAT Customized bulletproof leather coats, jackets, vests and pants made by Urban Body Armor of Jersey City.
"The whole idea was to invent nonconspicuous soft body armor that can be worn daily and blend into urban environments without giving a person's protection away," said Darryl Barnes, 32, the company's president.

LOOKING FOR A DONOR TO CALL DAD
In 1981, I founded Single Mothers by Choice and have worked with hundreds of our members who have conceived a child by donor insemination.

Many Japanese Women Are Resisting Servility
For centuries, Japanese women have trailed behind their husbands, scrubbing away their muddy footprints, preparing and draining their baths and, once upon a time, paying for infidelity with their delicate heads.
They bore their femininity proudly, even blackening their teeth in the 17th century in a bow to fashion.
The servitude was so extreme that a Spanish trader in the 16th century described the women as "pious" and "excellent," and the Japanese men as "cruel."


Sports of The Times; Three Sets Later, Monica Who?
IN the far-off state of Connecticut, Monica Seles was preparing her comeback speech, but suddenly there was no great urgency.
For one glorious afternoon, women's tennis was alive and well without her.
Who needed Seles to save the entire industry of female athletes swatting fuzzy tennis balls?
Here on the scuffed lawn of southwest London, the world had Arantxa Sanchez Vicario against Steffi Graf, and that was quite good enough.


POSTINGS: $3 Million and Up; For Top Co-ops, Peak Prices
Sale prices for at least one type of New York City co-op -- ultra-luxury, high-end properties -- have finally climbed back to, and in some cases now exceed, the peak of the market in the late 80's, according to Lawrence Sicular &amp; Associates, an appraiser and researcher in Manhattan that surveyed 41 apartments that sold for at least $3 million in 1994 through mid-May.
"It's a fairly small universe," Mr.
Sicular said, noting that because of the low number of apartments in the study he was not able to calculate a median sales price for this rarefied niche or an overall percentage increase over the last five or six years.


Losing Big In a Hot Mutual Fund
Past performance, as the prospectuses say, is no guarantee of the future.
But if you understand what produced the results, it can help in forecasting.
Nowhere is that more clear than when a small mutual fund has got hot.
It pays to learn not just the percentage gains the fund has racked up, but to figure out how many dollars were involved, and what investment decisions really produced the gains.
Maybe the manager was good; maybe lucky.
But if a fund has grown rapidly, a strategy that once worked may be impossible to repeat, a fact that many investors learn only after they have leaped into the fund.


'The Front Page' in Revival at the Phoenix
THE setting is the press room of the Criminal Courts Building in Chicago.
Notice the roll-top desk, just the spot where a scheming editor and his star reporter can stash an escaped anarchist while everyone (the moronic sheriff, the crooked Mayor, the supporting cast of newspapermen) goes gunning for the convict who got away on the eve of his scheduled trip to the gallows.
See the three connecting windows (one would be skimpy for the elaborate suicide leap in Act II) and six telephones, ever off the hook.
Most essentially, the double doors at stage center allow maximum space for the entrances and exits of a cast (count more than 20) that never stops bolting.


The Joys of Camp, Despite Asthma
IT looked like any summer camp check-in: parents and children lugged sleeping bags, pillows and duffel bags; forms and permission slips were handed over and pictures taken.
But several children also carried small, white machines, and their parents were toting plastic bags full of bottles, boxes and implements.
On a recent Sunday 80 asthmatic boys and girls, ages 9 to 13, arrived at Camp Treasure Chest for a week of typical camp activities -- and intense medical supervision.
The camp, sponsored by the American Lung Association of Connecticut, is held jointly with the Y. M. C. A.'s Camp Hazen, which has 120 campers at the same site in Chester.


Bernard F. Riess, Professor Dismissed in McCarthy-Era, Dies at 87
Dr.
Bernard F. Riess, a prominent psychologist whose dismissal from the Hunter College faculty in 1952 for refusal to answer Senate questions in the heyday of McCarthyism was redressed by New York City 30 years later, died on Monday at his home in New Preston, Conn.
He was 87.
In a career that spanned more than 60 years, Dr.
Riess was a university teacher, a therapist with private and community-clinic practices, the director of mental health centers, an industrial consultant, the author and editor of scores of articles and books, and a lifelong advocate of progressive causes.


Clark Kent Suits Up For the 90's

MATRONS OF HONOR
Bliven's article reminded me of a particular style of hat that is worn by just about every woman in Germany past a certain age.
It resembles a somewhat flattened, inverted flowerpot and is placed with great precision squarely in the center of the head, worn slightly forward.
Talk about formidable.

Official Balks At Releasing Waco Papers
The director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has objected to recent Congressional requests for the personnel records of all employees who were involved in the Government raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., in 1993.
The objections by the director, John W. Magaw, were set out in a memorandum to Edward S. Knight, general counsel for the Treasury Department, which has jurisdiction over the firearms agency.
Mr.
Magaw urged resistance to the Congressional requests, and a Treasury official said today that Mr.
Knight probably would adopt that position.


Race-Tinged Furor Stalls Arthur Ashe Memorial
City officials seriously consider ousting a statue of Christopher Columbus from a Richmond park.
A white man wearing Civil War medals lectures the black-majority City Council on the sensibilities of the "Confederate-American population." And the usually courtly L. Douglas Wilder, former Governor of Virginia, calls an idea from the city's Mayor "moronic."
All this heat is being shed on a matter that less than two weeks ago was considered settled: A statue of the black tennis pioneer Arthur Ashe, the city's best-known native son, was to join those of five pre-eminent Confederates on Richmond's Monument Avenue, a boulevard that the National Park Service has called "the South's grandest commemorative precinct dedicated to the heroes of the Lost Cause."


A Great Quarter Except for Japanese Gold Mines
How good was the second quarter?
It was very good for funds that aim to shine in a bull market.
Only two diversified funds in that group -- Robertson Stephens Emerging Growth and Goldman Sachs Small Cap Equity -- actually lost money.
Almost exclusively, the worst performers in the period were funds that specialize in Japanese or gold stocks.
Other funds with negative returns, like the Calvert and Dreyfus strategic growth funds, and Rydex Ursa, are intended to take advantage of something the quarter did not offer: a weak market for equities.


2d Special Olympics Athlete Reported Missing
The police in Connecticut were searching yesterday for a Special Olympics athlete from the Dominican Republic who was last seen Friday afternoon by his teammates in New Haven.
A spokesman for the Special Olympics World Games said the police in Hamden, Conn., where the Dominican athletes were staying, believe that the missing basketball player, Juan Carlos Balbuena, 20, might be trying to seek asylum in the United States.

Private Security Proposal Is Fading
When the developer Howard P. Milstein began promoting his vision of a private security force for the entire Upper East Side last year, he did not anticipate the furor it would provoke or the vocal opposition of so many civic groups and local elected officials.

Milstein, the plan's originator, has dropped it.
He announced his decision in recent letters to community leaders and the more than 100 neighborhood condo and co-op buildings managed by his real estate company, Douglas Elliman Gibbons &amp; Ives.


You Can't Cure Addiction by Willpower Alone
To the Editor:
"A Change in Governors Stalls Model Drug Program in Texas" (front page, July 4) quotes Emmitt W.

Enrollment Bulge Forces Schools to Scramble for Space
As recently as 1988, schools across New Jersey were closing as the birth rate leveled off and enrollments dwindled.
But now, many districts are reopening abandoned buildings and hurriedly expanding others to accommodate an elementary school population that is growing faster than anyone expected.
A combination of residential development, immigration and a baby boom that began in the mid-1980's is swelling enrollments, especially in newly developed suburbs that are attracting young families.
School districts of all sizes are holding bond referendums, hoping to build new facilities and additions to existing schools.


Arts Suffering In Bombing In Oklahoma
One of the casualties of the terrorist bombing of the Federal Building on April 19 was the annual festival that raises money for this city's arts programs.
It was to have begun on April 25 but was canceled as the city mourned the 167 people who died in the explosion.
Overnight, the Arts Council of Oklahoma City, which has been financially in the black for 29 years, found itself $170,000 in debt for the thousands of printed programs it could not use and such items as the $8,000 worth of paper cups it would have to store.
Suddenly, it had no money to meet its payroll or support summer arts programs for children.
In all, it faced a loss of $550,000.


Melanie Shulman, Marc A. Feigen
Dr.
Melanie Shulman, the Javits Fellow in behavioral neurology at Boston University, was married last evening to Marc Alan Feigen, a management consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company in New York.

Her father, a professor emeritus of otolaryngology at the State University Health Sciences Center in Brooklyn, is the founder and director of the Martha Entenmann Tinnitus Center in Brooklyn.
The bride's mother, Arlene Shulman, is the leadership chairwoman for the Queens region of Hadassah.


Jack and John: 2 for The Road At G.M.
ONE Saturday last February, a bunch of high-powered General Motors executives, board members and their spouses divided into teams and spent the next few hours building cars out of plastic pipe and glue.
Then, with teammates pushing or pulling, they took turns driving their handiwork around a racetrack in the Arizona desert.
At stake were prizes for the fastest and best-looking vehicles.
When one car fell apart after 30 yards, what little was left of their executive dignity dissolved in a burst of snickers, hoots and guffaws.
Some contestants thought this whole exercise, designed to encourage the directors to know G.M. managers and become more familiar with the company, a bit silly.
But their presence in the desert that day says a lot about the power of the nonexecutive chairman of the board, John G. Smale, at America's largest company.


H.M.O.'S REFUSING EMERGENCY CLAIMS, HOSPITALS ASSERT
As enrollment in health maintenance organizations soars, hospitals across the country report that H.M.O.'s are increasingly denying claims for care provided in hospital emergency rooms.
Such denials create obstacles to emergency care for H.M.O. patients and can leave them responsible for thousands of dollars in medical bills.
The denials also frustrate emergency room doctors, who say the H.M.O. practices discourage patients from seeking urgently needed care.
But for their part, H.M.O.'s say their costs would run out of control if they allowed patients unlimited access to hospital emergency rooms.


POSTINGS: A New Use for an Old Folly; A Learning Center for the Belvedere Castle
Central Park's Belvedere Castle is getting a $340,000 rehabilitation as part of $3 million in education grants from the Henry Luce Foundation and the Lila Wallace Readers Digest Fund.
The castle, perched on a rock outcropping overlooking the Delacorte Theater near West 79th Street, is to reopen next May as the Luce Learning Center, with exhibits and programs centered on the park as a natural habitat.
The castle, a Gothic style Calvert Vaux folly from 1872 that now houses only a weather station (the castle's tower is the highest structure in the park), will get new doors and windows, and repairs to its granite and schist stonework.
The project, under the auspices of the Central Park Conservancy, is directed by the architectural firm of Campagna &amp; Russo, which designed the castle's northwest pavilion restoration.

A Way to Hold On to Those Stock Profits
AS the bull market ages, many investors worry that a downturn is imminent and that their profits may quickly turn to dust.
On the other hand, they don't want to miss out on the fun if the market keeps rising.
It's the eternal quandary of investors: Hold or sell?
There is a third way.
Just as some people buy options on individual stocks to guard against falling prices, investors can buy options on indexes to insure their portfolios against broader market drops.
With options in hand, investors can profit if the market rises, but they can cut some of their losses if it falls.


Assembly Delays Revaluation Bill
A CLOSELY watched bill to revalue all property in Westchester -- which was expected to set a precedent for other counties in the state to follow -- failed to make it to the floor of the State Assembly late last month.
But county Legislators stressed that the bill was not dead.
Rather, they said, they needed more time to study what is a complicated and critical issue.


Golden Bri Upsets 1-5 Serena's Song
Serena's Song, the queen of the fillies, may have run one race too many.
And she showed it in the homestretch at Belmont Park yesterday when she was run down and defeated by Golden Bri in the $250,000 Coaching Club American Oaks, a race billed as a milestone on her path to the filly championship.
But it was a milestone on a path that stretched for a mile and a quarter, a distance that Serena's Song had run only once before -- in the Kentucky Derby, when she led the colts for one mile before also fading in the stretch to finish 16th.
It's no disgrace not to be able to run 10 furlongs, and it may not even cost her the 3-year-old championship.
But for one afternoon, at least, the magic of the D. Wayne Lukas wand did not produce a winner.


Plymouth Rock, 375 Years Later
For the 375th anniversary of the arrival of the Pilgrims in Plymouth, Mass., a series of events is planned by several organizations, including the Plymouth Chamber of Commerce, the Plymouth County Development Council and Plimoth Plantation, a re-creation of the 17th-century settlement.
On July 19, a reproduction of the Mayflower, the Mayflower II, will sail from Plymouth to Provincetown, where the Pilgrims first saw land in 1620.
On July 20, the signing of the Mayflower Compact will be re-enacted on board.
On the Plymouth waterfront, Supreme Court Justice David Souter is scheduled to swear in 102 new United States citizens, a salute to the 102 passengers who arrived on the Mayflower.


Moral Dimension
To the Editor:
As a son of the composer Sergei Prokofiev and an ardent student of his musical legacy, I take exception to Richard Taruskin's article "Great Artists Serving Stalin Like a Dog"  [ May 28 ] .
In this article he urges that "Ivan the Terrible," the 1944 film by Sergei Eisenstein with music by Prokofiev, be "buried" because he believes that "it is a blatant piece of Stalinist triumphalism" and a "glorification of the N.K.V.D.," the secret police.

Whether they are carving ivory in Africa, jade in China, marble in Greece or lava in Hawaii, sculptors often reveal a great deal about their surroundings by the materials they use.

Now About Those Weeds, Before It's Too Late
SOMEONE once defined a weed as a "plant out of place." Often enough, quite right.
Many respected wild flowers are thought of as weeds.
Beauty seems to be in the eye of the beholder.
The temptation is to consider these plants as botanical intruders.
But one thought should be in the weeds' favor.
Many of them have had vital roles in the establishment of civilizations over the centuries.
In a certain sort of way, weeds deserve some respect.

But if you are a fan of diners, John Waters movies, Edgar Allan Poe and Elvis (who's inexplicably big here), you might think this is the hippest city in America.
And surely the only one with a nine-foot bronze statue of Billie Holiday.
Baltimore definitely does not inspire that just-got-off-the-Interstate-and-could-be-anywhere state of mind.
French fries drenched in gravy are a local specialty, as is calling people "hon," as in "More fries, hon?" Last year, a hon enthusiast who came to be known as Hon Man repeatedly spray-painted the sign at the edge of the city, which said "Welcome to Baltimore, Hon" after he got through with it.
He was invited to meet the mayor.


Experiment in Green; Officials Dole Out Chunks of Riverside Park, And Corps of Volunteers Pick Up the Pieces
In the tangled northern reaches of Riverside Park, Bette Midler pays a 10-person crew to pick up trash.
Tennis players groom the clay courts themselves near 96th Street.
An old man who calls himself "the phantom trash collector" patrols the lower 17 blocks of the park every day.
A 10-year-old girl has adopted the Kossuth Statue at 113th Street.
New York City, it seems, has found a new solution to litter, obsolete equipment and ragged pruning in public parks: give them away, piece by piece.
From gardens to tennis courts to fountains, some 39 chunks of Riverside Park, which stretches from 72d Street to 158th Street along the Hudson River, have been parceled out to volunteers to groom, clean and partially finance.

Streetscapes/'Historical Building Construction'; The Nuts and Bolts Behind New York's Facades
TO judge from a shelf full of three decades of books on New York, we have not come much further than a cursory understanding of construction technology.
The typical history of New York building, it seems, is a history of exterior style.
But now a practicing engineer, Donald Friedman, has written "Historical Building Construction" (W. W. Norton, 1995), the first work to try to explain how New York's buildings have gone up -- and occasionally come down.
Tread carefully, because Mr.
Friedman wrote the book for construction professionals, and half of the volume is lost on anyone not familiar with concepts like "gravity moment" and "eccentric loading." But stick with it and you will be rewarded by the other half, a useful primer on the complicated and sometimes contradictory path taken by the engineers and architects who have had to use brick and steel to solve real estate problems of finance and law.


Tenant Versus Landlord
FOR most homeowners, the answer to a warped floor, a broken window or a leaky pipe is fairly obvious: Hunker down and fix the problem, or hire someone to fix it for you.
But what happens when home is a rented apartment and the person responsible for fixing things is the landlord?
What happens when that warp or break or leak is not inherently dangerous but just annoying enough to drive you crazy?
And what happens when the landlord either ignores your plea for help or flatly refuses to make a repair?


Life on the Loaf
To the Editor:
In 1975 I practically ran away from home to work as a waiter at Bread Loaf.
It was a raucous, uplifting time.
One way I kept my "customers" in the dining hall satisfied was by bringing a bottle of vodka to breakfast -- just a wee bit in the juice set the tone for the day.
And I hazily (though fondly) recall some vigorous fumbling about with a stranger or two in somebody's bedroom.
As Joseph Brod sky, who visited one weekend, wrote: "My youth comes back. Sometimes I smile. Or spit."

Her father is a partner in Macfarlane Ausley Ferguson &amp; McMullen, a law firm in Tampa.


Better Finances, but Not Better Test Scores
Six years ago, dead people collected health benefits from the school system here.
Contractor payoffs dogged the maintenance department, though some classrooms had not smelled of fresh paint in 30 years.
Then the state took over and that sort of thing largely ended.
Six years ago, the students in Jersey City also scored badly on standardized tests, dropped out at three times the state average and had poor attendance records.
After the state took over, they still do.


In a Classic, Graf Captures Wimbledon On Sheer Will
Steffi Graf, despite a recalcitrant physique and a suspicion that suffering for her tennis may not be the only way to live, captured her second Grand Slam crown of 1995 today, winning Wimbledon in a memorable match on a steamy afternoon.
Once again, just as it had been a month ago when she fought her way to the French Open championship, Graf's opponent was second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the plucky Spaniard with whom she has already exchanged the No. 1 ranking six times this year.


2 Restaurant Dynasties Join to Open Steakhouse
TWO Long Island restaurant dynasties will join forces this summer when the Boulder Creek Family Steakhouse opens in Syossett.
The Scotto family, which owns the Westbury Manor, the Fox Hollow Inn in Woodbury and other local restaurants, and the Sbarros, who operate an international chain of 176 Italian fast-food franchises, along with Sal Moscato, owner of the Irga Pastry factory in Bethpage, are partners in the venture.
Neither Mario Sbarro, chairman of Sbarro's, nor Anthony Scotto, the major partner who directs his family's business, have released details about the enterprise.
But the first of two Boulder Creeks is being built on Jericho Turnpike, where the Moonraker and El Torito had been.


As a Beat, Business Is Booming
IRVING R. LEVINE STILL shivers at the memory of Jan. 8, 1971.
That was the day NBC News asked him to try his hand at business reporting.
Mr.
Levine had just completed a lengthy tour as a foreign correspondent in Moscow, Rome and London.
He wanted to cover the State Department next.
But his bosses handed him the economics and business beat.
"It was a barren time," Mr.
Levine, who is 72, said the other day.
"Producers just weren't interested in those stories."

GOLF  Ogle and Lowery Share Lead
Brett Ogle birdied the 18th hole yesterday to tie Steve Lowery for the lead after three rounds of the Western Open in Lemont, Ill.
Ogle shot a three-under-par 69 and Lowery a 70 to move past the second-round leader Jay Haas with a three-day total of 209.
Haas led until the 16th hole but bogeyed the last two to fall one shot back.
Bob Estes and Grant Waite were another stroke off the pace.
Tom Watson, looking for his first PGA Tour victory since 1987, headed a group of five golfers three shots back. (AP)

Baseball Talks May Resume
The baseball labor negotiations that disappeared more than three months ago could come back soon.
A management person close to the owners' negotiating committee said the committee hopes to resume talks "in some form" in 10 days to two weeks.
That timetable in mind, the committee has a meeting scheduled for tomorrow in Dallas.
Participating in the meeting will be Rob Manfred, who had been the owners' No. 2 labor lawyer but who will apparently become No. 1.
He would replace Chuck O'Connor, his associate at the Washington firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius, who was dismissed by Bud Selig, the acting commissioner.

New Yorkers &amp; Co.
Living Well Lady Plans Extra-Large Club From his Houston headquarters, Peter Magee runs 54 Living Well Lady health clubs around the country, including three in Manhattan.
Most are about 5,000 square feet and all limit their membership to women.
In an effort to compete with the mega-health clubs opening throughout the city, Mr.
Magee is installing a 16,000-square-foot club at One East 43d Street, just off Fifth Avenue, which he plans to open by the end of the summer.
He's calling it Living Well, but the no-men-need-apply edict will stand.
The club will feature a 4,000-square-foot aerobics floor, Mr.
Magee said.


A Literary Critic and Truths About Incest
LOUISE DESALVO and I are sitting on the beach at Sagaponak.
As we speak we are sifting the sand through our fingers, the way people do when they talk half to each other and half thinking their own thoughts.
I am thinking about the Greek notion of catharsis.
Or rather I am thinking about the way we first learned about it in junior high school: that if people saw re-enacted on the stage their most treacherous wishes, it would cleanse them of their own dangerous desires for revenge; it would relax them and relieve them.


Ideas &amp; Trends; A Surprising Muse For the Stage: Science
"YOU cannot stir things apart," observes a 13-year-old prodigy in Tom Stoppard's "Arcadia," which is playing in New York City.
She points out that if you stir jam in rice pudding, you cannot unstir it by moving the spoon backward.
"Do you not think this is odd?"
Indeed it is.
It seems to violate a principle of simple Newtonian physics, that all motion is reversible and all stirring unstirrable.
And odder still is the idea that "Arcadia" and other recent theatrical events should encompass the weighty world of science at all.
Nuclear fission, chaos theory and encryption procedures can sometimes seem to be replacing such familiar fare as love and death.


A Middle East Milestone
Word from the long-running peace talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization is encouraging.
The two sides have agreed in principle to begin a more ambitious phase of Palestinian autonomy that would change the map of Israel and the Middle East.
Details could be worked out by the end of this month.
The Israeli Army would then begin withdrawing from major West Bank cities, allowing Palestinians to organize national elections for an administrative council.
If these timetables hold, the Oslo peace framework signed nearly two years ago on the White House lawn would take a mighty step from promise to reality.
By next year, remarkably, the overwhelming majority of Palestinians in the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 could be under elected Palestinian rule.
In return Israel expects the P.L.O. to fulfill a commitment to eliminate the section of its charter calling for the destruction of Israel.
Credit for getting matters this far belongs chiefly to Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and the P.L.O.'s chairman, Yasir Arafat, with useful encouragement from the Clinton Administration.


Gerri Lieberman, Andrew Sommers
Gerri Melissa Lieberman, a daughter of Patricia and Michael Lieberman of Plainview, L.I., was married on Monday to Andrew Sommers, a son of Lesley and Ronald Sommers of New City, N.Y.

The Whitman Effect
In political terms, Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey has had a sensational first year and a half in office.
With a recently enacted $16 billion budget, she has cut income taxes as promised in two years instead of three, without shredding local aid or social programs.
Small wonder that she is being talked about for the national Republican ticket.
But these achievements are accompanied by genuine risks to the long-term financial health of the state.
Looked at closely, Mrs.
Whitman's fiscal practices reflect less of a Republican revolution in downsized government than the same old game of spending now and paying the price later.
The Governor's first year in office was marked by a reduction in annual payments to the state employee pension fund, which allowed her to implement the first phase of her promised 30 percent cut in the income tax rate.
This page was critical of that move as certain to raise the state budget liability for pensions drastically in future years.
But Mrs.
Whitman persuaded the legislators, if not the bond-rating agencies, that the pension system was "overfunded" and that it was a matter of equity that current taxpayers not have to foot the bill for future retirement costs.
She was unfortunately employing a dubious practice to which desperate governors and mayors across the country have been turning in these years of fiscal stringency.

Junior Achievement
THE power and influence of New Jersey's delegation to the House of Representatives is etched in stone, literally: dozens of important buildings erected over many years with Federal dollars and the federally subsidized roadways that helped define the state.
The delegation's members were also immortalized by Congressional longevity of legendary proportions and their ability, year after year, to herd billions of dollars to their home turf.


For the L.A. Ballet, Three Lives (So Far)
ALONE IN A MAMMOTH SPACE that was once a storage plant, John Clifford breaks into a run, marking off the 50-foot-by-60-foot boundary that will be his main studio.
It is, he says, "as large as the stage at Lincoln Center's State Theater." Never one to feign modesty, Mr.
Clifford, the former New York City Ballet principal for whom George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins created a total of nine ballets in the late 1960's and early 70's, talks with unbridled optimism.
In fact, Mr.
Clifford is so enthusiastic that a visitor would never guess that his Los Angeles Ballet is regenerating itself for the third time in 20 years.
Its latest incarnation, a 46-member troupe with contracts calling for a 40-week minimum season, seems to be on firm ground.
What's more, this ingeniously capitalized enterprise comes at a time when most performing-arts troupes face crimped budgets.

Glorious Shade

A blue-eyed blonde of the blondest sort -- natural, thank you -- I had found a co-sufferer in the author.
"Sun and fun" -- hah!
Sun and pain, more like.
Throughout childhood I longed for the 19th century when, so I read, proper ladies stayed pale as white summer linens under their parasols.
Not only more graceful, the parasols wouldn't have the sticky feel and overripe smell of suntan lotion.

'Does Anyone Here Think Tnis Baby Can Live?'
The Brigham doctors had tried to prepare the DeCostas for both possibilities when Jennifer first arrived at the hospital three days earlier, having inexplicably gone into labor in her 23d week of pregnancy.
Gathering around her bedside like benevolent priests, the doctors told the young couple that, yes, a fetus has been known to live after only 23 weeks' gestation, but that its chances of surviving without severe abnormalities are vanishingly small; a normal pregnancy, after all, lasts about 40 weeks.
The doctors said they wouldn't know until they actually saw Jennifer's baby in the delivery room -- because maybe it would be closer to 24 weeks old, in which case the odds improved dramatically.
But they explained that every borderline infant must be considered something of a medical experiment.
Jennifer is a pretty, spirited 22-year-old with a mop of curly blond hair and wide green eyes.
At home in Abington, Mass., taking care of her first child, an 18-month-old daughter named Siarra, Jennifer had seemed mature beyond her years, filled with the uncommon energy and grace it takes to be a good mother.
But lying in her hospital bed at Brigham and Women's, hardly showing in her oversize maternity gown, she looked childlike herself, far too young to be facing such grim prospects for her family.

MOVIES THIS WEEK
THREE Hollywood stalwarts strut their stuff in two films each on television this week.
John Barrymore devours his roles in Harry D'Arrast's TOPAZE (1933) and Howard Hawks's TWENTIETH CENTURY (1934) like juicy pomegranates.
Both pictures are highlights of Hollywood's golden era.
In the droll "Topaz" (from Marcel Pagnol's play), he's a naive Paris pedagogue who learns corporate wiles, turns rich mogul and calmly annexes a victim's mistress (the charming Myrna Loy).
Barrymore's gradual transformation and the film's sly ironies are enthralling - Thursday at 1:30 P.M. on American Movie Classics.
In the raffish "Twentieth Century" he lets fly hilariously with tasty, ham-spiced flamboyance as a Broadway egomaniac, matched every step of the way by Carole Lombard, as his ex-mistress.
Here is one co-starring duo straight from heaven (via Hecht-MacArthur's stage hit) - Saturday/Early Sunday at 12:05 A.M. on Channel 13.

Three astronauts (Mr. Hanks, Mr. Bacon and Mr. Paxton) are headed for the Moon when alarms go off in the spacecraft and just about every system on board seems to be broken.
The three try to be brave while the fellows at Mission Control (including Mr. Harris and Mr. Sinise) figure out how to get the astronauts home alive.
VIOLENCE -- None, but there are a number of scary moments when systems start failing.

AGES 8 and up -- Youngsters with any interest in space travel should appreciate this story.

July 2-8: Acting Like a Criminal; Former Prosecutor Guilty Of Aiding Drug Dealers
Experts in legal ethics talk about the fine line that defense lawyers must walk to remain advocates for their clients without becoming their confederates.

Mr.
Ferguson, 48, pleaded guilty last week to reduced charges of money laundering and conspiring to obstruct justice to help Colombian cocaine traffickers.
He will be sentenced to prison (guidelines call for seven to nine years) after he testifies against two other lawyers who, the Government says, also crossed the line to aid cocaine smugglers.


The Curse of Eros
SECRET LIFE An Autobiography. By Michael Ryan.  356 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $25.


Affirmative Reaction; For the Civil Rights Movement, A New Reason for Living
DEFEAT can be demoralizing; setbacks can rejuvenate.
After a string of adverse rulings by the Supreme Court, civil rights groups and their political allies are now trying to figure out whether they have opportunity or only despair.
As they do, a small number -- mind you, a very small number -- of liberal strategists and thinkers, black and white, are moving beyond the hand-wringing that has greeted the Court's decisions last month limiting Federal affirmative action programs and the drawing of election districts to concentrate minority votes.
To these contrarians, the decisions may give a new sense of urgency to a movement whose influence and membership have waned and whose leadership has often been ineffective.


Champions Share Skill And Mighty Coincidence
This is a story of remarkable coincidences, and never mind that in China, as elsewhere, some children are retarded or burned or maimed or abandoned.
But all four happening to a boy and a girl whose lives have since coincided?
And who became the best table tennis players in the Special Olympics World Games here this week?
And who together won the gold medal in mixed doubles with, between them, two left hands and no right?
His name is Yong Xi.
Her name is Peng Kai.
Both are 21.
They were abandoned months apart at age 2, he in the Shanghai railroad station and she at a Shanghai orphanage.
Their parents could not be found, so they grew up in the same orphanage.
Before he was abandoned, fire had destroyed his right hand, leaving a stump, and had badly scarred the right side of his face.
Before she was abandoned, fire had destroyed her right hand, leaving a thumb and a stump.
It also left her unable to grow hair, so she wears a black wig with bangs.


The Table Is Set for Hungry Finalists
Just after he was informed that Pete Sampras, Wimbledon's mild-mannered defending champion and his opponent in this year's grand finale, had described his appetite for a third consecutive title as "ravenous," Boris Becker asked for an exact definition.
Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion himself, smiled an enigmatic smile and then issued a subtle challenge to Sampras on the subject of the bragging rights to the 1995 championship.


Penny Simon and Edwin Russell
UNLIKE the stereotypical Secret Service agent who is barely more animate than a Mount Rushmore figure, Edwin Russell is emotional, confessional and often downright silly.
At 46, he carries around plastic cockroaches to use in pranks and is more interested in talking about his definition of true love than about guns or assassinations.
Working from an office in New York, he is part of the team that protects President Clinton on visits to Manhattan and in the past has guarded such notables as Marilyn Quayle on diving expeditions and Ron Reagan when he was a member of the Joffrey Ballet.


Lemon Squeeze
Lemons, like most edible aspects of modern life, are no longer constrained by seasons.
The most acidic of all citrus fruits, lemons are arguably at their best from December to March.
Nevertheless, during the winter lemons barely squeeze their way into the season's typically rich dishes.
In the spring, when ingredients and cooking techniques are delicate, the personality of lemons is most apparent, most insistently young, most indisputably alive.
There is something eternal about the freshness a lemon imparts, though Her Royal Yellow Bitterness is actually a fairly contemporary fruit.
Botanists are divided as to whether the fruit was initially cultivated in Malaysia, China or the Indus Valley, but they agree that lemons haven't been grown for much more than 2,000 years.
Lemon trees grow best in semidry, constantly warm climates, like the Mediterranean, especially Sicily, as well as California and Arizona.
The tree itself is a subtropical evergreen with tender leaves and an intoxicatingly fragrant flower.
But the fruit of the lemon tree, as the song goes, is "impossible to eat."


A Culinary Salute to a City Tradition
BOWDEN SQUARE lives.
The landmark Southampton restaurant that flourished for half a century has been revived.
For three seasons, Sfuzzi, an upscale Italian chain, held forth on the premises.
Now, a team of traditional restaurateurs, with ties to the old days of the "21" Club in Manhattan, has brought back the old Bowden Square.
It has restored more than just the name.
This is once again a conservative American-continental restaurant.
It even has a private club ensconced in its main dining room.
The public is consigned to the barroom and the wide, gracious porches.
They offer the most pleasant dining experience, with their flagstone floors, black-and-white stripped awnings and views of the flower-filled garden.
White napery, long-stemmed crystal and floral nosegays complete the summery scene.

Filly Wins at Yonkers
CR Kay Suzie became the first filly to win the Yonkers Trot in 39 years tonight, easily capturing the first leg of trotting's triple crown in a stakes-record time of 1 minute 56 seconds.
Driven by Rod Allen on a warm, breezy evening at Yonkers Raceway, CR Kay Suzie, an overwhelming favorite, had no trouble leaving from the difficult No. 8 post in the eight-horse race, bursting to the front of the pack by a length and a half at the quarter pole, and breezing uncontested the rest of the mile, 7 1/2 lengths ahead of Abundance, and 10 1/2 in front of Deliberate Speed.


Partition of Palistine
With the world's attention turned elsewhere, it has been easy to lose track of what the Israelis and Palestinians have been up to lately.
That is a mistake.
Because what they have been up to is weaving an agreement of immense importance.
It is an agreement to begin the partition of historic Palestine -- a division of the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea into two states, one Jewish and the other Arab.
When Israel agreed to turn over control of the Gaza Strip to Yasir Arafat nearly two years ago, it was getting rid of a problem, cutting off what Israelis thought of as a cancerous limb.
But the draft understanding announced last week between Israel and Mr.
Arafat is something different.
It involves Israel's ceding of control to Mr.
Arafat in four major West Bank Arab towns -- Jenin, Nablus, Tulkarm and Qalqilya -- as well as phased-in Palestinian control in three others -- Ramallah, Bethlehem and Hebron.


The Supper Club
There are six of us now -- women of the same generation, give or take a few years, whose lives are loosely bound by similar interests and a tenacious fondness for one another.
In the beginning there were only two, each of whom thought that the other should know her best friend.
The first menu consisted of recipes from small-town American women's-club cookbooks (for which the member who grew up abroad was assigned the deviled eggs).
Since then, we've convened on an irregular basis for potluck suppers and conversation about topics of urgent interest: work, for example, and marriage, real estate, E-mail, clothes.
The focus of the evening, however, is invariably the food -- not so much the cooking as the planning and finally, enthusiastically, the eating.
From time to time, there's a motion to introduce boyfriends and husbands to the proceedings, but it is always tabled, not because we couldn't speak so freely in their presence but because we couldn't eat so freely.


Tonilomawacana? How Is That Pronounced?
To The Editor:
Tom Wolfe may think himself clever in coining the term WeVar ("Pioneers Head West, Far West, Past Varick," May 14), and realtors may drool over the potential profits generated in a district they would love to call the South Village, but those of us who live west of Varick between Houston and Canal Streets cling to a more ancient, if highly questionable, heritage.


Kristen Creaven, Joseph Ferrarese
Kristen Marisa Creaven, the daughter of Carole and John Creaven of New York, was married yesterday to Joseph Louis Ferrarese, a son of Eileen and Louis Ferrarese of Demarest, N.J.
Msgr.
Robert L. Stern, a cousin of the bride, performed the ceremony at the Church of St.
Ignatius Loyola in New York.
Mrs.
Ferrarese, 27, is a registered nurse at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
She graduated from the College of New Rochelle.


Nelson's Running Game Means New Roles for Everyone
The business of finding a suitable replacement for Pat Riley is over, enabling the Knicks to move on to other matters of personnel.
As to how long the mercurial John Starks can keep misfiring until being seated and how many minutes 33-year-old Derek Harper can play without water, they will soon learn.
Their new taskmaster, Don Nelson, has taken several videotapes with him to Lithuania (where he is visiting family) with the notion of learning which Knicks have been naughty, which have been nice and which can be put on the trading block immediately.


LOOKING FOR A DONOR TO CALL DAD
Donor insemination is no longer the only option.
Centers that treat infertile couples have aggressive programs for severe male infertility.
These treatments include intracytoplasmic single-sperm injection (ICSI) into individual eggs, followed by intrauterine transfer of successful embryos.
At our facility, ICSI has been taken a step further, when male ejaculate shows virtually no sperm.
A simple surgical procedure is used to obtain selected, viable sperm directly from the testes for in vitro fertilization of individual eggs in a laboratory setting.
Our first such such patient's baby -- a healthy boy -- was born last year.

BEHIND THE WHEEL/Acura NSX-T; Refreshment for Two In a Pop-Top Container
IT goes without saying that exotic cars require money.
But the four-wheeled fantasies of the world also call for something more.
They require time.
When you drive such a beastie, there is no short stop for gas, no drop-it-and-run at the parking garage.
Whatever the destination, you have to allot time to talk about The Car.


New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks
MY IDEA OF FUN: A Cautionary Tale By Will Self.
Vintage International, $12.
Is Ian Wharton a murderer -- or about to become one?
Did he really make a pact with the Devil incarnate?
These are among the questions raised by the hallucinatory story Ian tells.
Last year our reviewer, George Stade, praised this novel "for intelligence and ambition, for inventiveness, comedy, heartbreak and ferocity."


Privatization Is Faulted For Accidents in Russia
Negligence, poor maintenance of equipment and lax safety standards are the main reasons for a rise in air and train crashes in Russia last year, according to a senior official.
At a news conference in Moscow, Aleksandr Godunko, in charge of monitoring violations of transport laws at the Russian Prosecutor's office, said that the number of air and train accidents was up 40 percent from 1993.


It's Sign One, Draft One For the Busy Islanders
The Islanders signed one top draft choice and didn't trade another, although they could have.
With forward Todd Bertuzzi safely under contract and defenseman Wade Redden in their web, they probably are a better team now than they were before today's National Hockey League draft.
But although they also had two picks in the second round, the busy Long Island team didn't make the big deal at the annual gathering of executives and future stars at Northlands Coliseum.


Alice L. Hanson, Christopher Kopac
Alice Lloyd Hanson, a daughter of Mrs.

Her father is a trust investment officer at Mellon Bank Central in State College.


CONNECTICUT GUIDE
ARTISTIC WHO'S WHO
Some exceptional paintings that are rarely removed from the National Arts Club in Manhattan may be seen at the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme through Sept. 3.
Titled "A Noble Tradition: American Painting from the National Arts Club," the exhibition contains some 35 pictures, mostly portraits and figures by a Who's Who of late 19th- and early 20th-century American artists.
They include Robert Henri, Charles Hawthorne, Colin Campbell Cooper, Harry Willson Watrous, Wayman Adams and William MacGregor.
Several others, including Robert Vonnoh, Frank Bicknell, Oscar Fehrer and Harry Hoffman, were members of the Old Lyme Art Colony, which maintained close ties to the National Arts Club.


Costly Pullout in Bosnia Looms Unless U.N. Can Prove Effective
The United Nations force in Bosnia has only a few weeks left to prove its effectiveness before a costly and dangerous NATO withdrawal of the United Nations soldiers -- involving as many as 25,000 American ground troops -- is almost certain to begin, officials on both sides of the Atlantic say.
Both President Clinton and allied European leaders are making new efforts to support the embattled peacekeeping force and insist that they have not given up hope.


A Shipyard Legend Named Luders
LONG before Interstate 95 paved its way eastward, Long Island Sound served as a nautical highway that ran 100 uncrowded miles from Throgs Neck to Plum Gut.
Shipyards were plentiful from Clason Point in the Bronx to Greenport, L.I., and one that had a great run was the Luders Marine Construction Company in Stamford Harbor.


K. G. Kirkpatrick, Daniel MacGowan
Kathy Gail Kirkpatrick, a daughter of Oran G. Kirkpatrick Jr. of Rye, N.Y., and the late Patricia G. Kirkpatrick, was married yesterday to Dr.
Daniel James Lysaght MacGowan, the son of Helen and Brian F. MacGowan of Stillorgan, Ireland.
The Rev.
Peter M. Larsen performed the Episcopal ceremony at St.
Andrew's Dune Church in Southampton, L.I.

LOOKING FOR A DONOR TO CALL DAD
I was a sperm donor in medical school ("Looking for a Donor to Call Dad," by Peggy Orenstein, June 18).
Beyond the money, I thought I was helping infertile couples have their own children, not mine.
If one of "my" kids showed up at my home, he or she would be quickly shown the door (with a subsequent restraining order, if necessary).
These people need to understand that they have parents, the ones who raised them.
The idea of looking for the "donor dad" is an insult to the real parents (Remember "The Wizard of Oz"? There's no place like home? I won't look any further than my own backyard?) In short, grow up and deal with it.
For obvious reasons, NAME WITHHELD


'The Tempest' At Boscobel
THE TEMPEST," eternally magical and endlessly mesmerizing, also happens to be the Shakespearean play of the moment. This year's opening production by the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival in the tent theater at the Boscobel Restoration here joins current stagings of Shakespeare's phantasmagoric exit play by Yale University's summer cabaret in New Haven and the New York Shakespeare Festival's Delacorte Theater in Central Park.
Ever the inspiration for innovation, including one-man shows with puppets, miniature sculptures, masks and marionettes, as well as operatic and balletic adaptations, "The Tempest" has the added lure of being a comedy to some, a tragedy to others.
Its mythical enchanted settings, with plots and counterplots that shake the earth, make possible limitless interpretations of big themes, from the mundane (power, revenge and all manner of conspiracies) to the sublime (forgiveness, redemption through art, the triumph of virtue over vengeance, the winning of good in a world of duplicity.)


The Camera As Culprit? Look Again
LIKE A REFORMED DRUNK WHO DECIDES THAT only prohibition can save sinners like himself, Don Hewitt has lately been proselytizing against television in the courtroom, or in certain courtrooms.
On the "Today" show, on CNBC, on "Crossfire" and on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, the godfather of "60 Minutes" has argued that the camera is not only more powerful than the pen but also too powerful for the public good when it focuses on trials, or at least murder trials, or at least the O. J. Simpson murder trial.
Mr.
Hewitt's reaction to the Simpson spectacle is sounder than his prescription.
In his Op-Ed piece, he resorted to rhetorical questions, those shaky substitutes for argument: "Would freedom of the press suffer if there were no camera?" "Where is it written that the public has a right to know?" Peculiar questions coming from a journalist, and uncompelling ones.


. . . And an Old Tune: Men Look, Women Display
THE CENTER RING OF THE international art circus known as the Venice Biennale is the ambitious exhibition about the human body organized by Jean Clair, commissioner of the Biennale and director of the Picasso Museum in Paris.
This exhibition, called "Identity and Alterity: A Short History of the Human Body and Face From 1895 to the Present," has many things going for it.
It brings together a century's worth of paintings, sculptures, photographs and drawings by artists great, unknown and in some instances undeserving, juxtaposing them with the often sensational visual byproducts of science and pseudo-science.


WESTCHESTER GUIDE
BLACK HERITAGE
The Sixth Annual African-American Heritage Celebration, which has attracted crowds of 5,500 to 8,000 each year, is scheduled next Saturday and Sunday at Trevor Park in Yonkers.
The festivities begin at 1 P.M.
Saturday, but the main event that day, a concert by Force MD, is scheduled for 8 P.M.
Most other major events are set for Sunday.
A parade down Riverdale and Warburton Avenues will step off from Ceratto Park at 1 P.M., led by the grand marshal, Robert Beane, and honorary grand marshals, Roy L. Lawson and Iris Rowe.
The parade will disperse at Trevor Park around 2, when a steady stream of entertainment will begin, provided by Force MD, the Jackie Robinson Steppers, Bokandeye Africa Dancers and the Westchester Invaders.
Ethnic foods and crafts from Africa will be for sale throughout the afternoon at booths.
Three outstanding teen-agers -- Kelly Ali, Quanda Meakeens and Jason Price -- will receive awards at 2 P.M. for extra-curricular activities and essays on "Voting: Our Right, Our Responsibility."
Admission is free, and more information may be obtained by calling 963-0640. 'TEMPEST' TEMPTATION
Westchester high school students are invited to brush up their Shakespeare at a theater party given by the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival and Boscobel in Garrison-on-Hudson, where the acting company is in residence.
Sensitive to the bland reception that Shakespeare often receives among the young, festival staff members and students organized the event, titled "If Music Be the Food of Love -- Rock On, Baby," to take place Wednesday from 6 to 11 P.M.
For $25 each, students and any parents who choose to take part will dine and dance, attend a performance of "The Tempest" and conclude with dessert during a reception with the cast.
The party was conceived by a committee of students from Beacon, Carmel, Hackley, Haldane, Roy C. Ketchum and Lakeland High Schools.
To tempt even more young people to Shakespeare, student discount tickets, for $5, are offered for a performance of "The Tempest" on July 19 and for "Two Gentlemen of Verona" on Aug. 2, 9 and 16.
Accompanying adults will be admitted for $10.
For more information, directions or reservations, the box office number is 265-9575.
EVENING OF SONG
Patty Larkin, singer-songwriter from Cape Cod and recording artist for Windham Hill-High Street Records, will appear Friday evening at 7 at 7 Willow Street in Port Chester.
Further information is available by calling 939-1729.
Tickets, which cost $13 in advance, $15 on the day of the show, may be ordered from the same number or through Ticketmaster.
LETTING THE PAINT FALL
Paul Seckel's acrylic paintings, on view from Wednesday through July 20 at the Wildcliff Center for the Arts in New Rochelle, follow a current trend in art toward letting accidents happen.
A native of Germany, Mr.
Seckel was trained at Central School of Arts in London and at Yale University, where he received his master's degree in fine art.
He has done advertising art, cartoons, lithographs and conventional paintings.
In his current work, he has opted for speed, spontaneity and letting the paint drip, smear or apply itself to the canvas.
Sometimes a theme or subject is suggested by what is happening on the canvas, he says, and sometimes he approaches the easel with a theme in mind.
The center is at 44 Wildcliff Road, where a reception for the artist will be held on Saturday from 3 to 5 P.M.
The information number is 235-4459.
BUGS IN THE GARDEN
Children and adults will be amused and intrigued by the 12-foot- high, 25-foot-long ant, and a similarly enormous dragonfly, praying mantis and spider in its 15-by-20-foot web, among other outsized insects on display at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.
Constructed by Dave Rogers, an artist with an affinity for dinosaurs, they are made from Eastern red cedar, black locust and golden willow trees, green saplings, dried branches, roots, vines and bark, and they have been positioned along tree-lined paths or set on hillocks of grass, where they will remain through Oct. 2.
They are part of an Insect Expedition, in progress at the garden through the summer, including a working beehive, butterfly tours, workshops and educational programs.
Hours are Tuesdays through Sundays from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.
Admission is $3, $1 for students, children and people 65 and older.
Children under 6 are admitted free.
The garden is at 200th Street and Southern Boulevard.
For more information or directions, the number is (718) 817-8700.
CAPTURING NATURE
A landscape painting class for beginners will be given next Saturday and repeated on Aug. 12, both at 2 P.M., at Lenoir Preserve, the wildlife sanctuary in Yonkers.
The workshop, sponsored by the Westchester County Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation, will be led by Michael Teator, an artist and instructor of traditional and wet-on-wet techniques.
A fee of $30 for each day covers instruction and the use of materials.
Finished paintings will be taken home, but brushes and paints will not.
The number for registration, directions or more information is 968-5851.
NO LANGUAGE BARRIER
Hungarian may be a difficult language to learn, but Hungarian music has universal appeal, as Papai Erika and Sziki Karoly will demonstrate in a performance this evening from 7 to 9 at the Pelham Art Center.
For the last four summers, this duo has come to the United States with a program of songs, poetry and vignettes of comedy and drama that define current social and political trends in Hungary.
The center is at 155 Fifth Avenue in Pelham.
Tickets cost $10.
The information number is 738-2525.
THAT OPERATIC CLOWN
A fully staged and costumed performance of Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" will be presented by Opera Mobile this evening at 7 P.M. in Schultze Park off Scarsdale Lane in Yonkers.
Admission is free, and audience members should bring seating.
The work's familiar arias -- and its story rife with jealousy, illicit love, revenge and murder in two relatively short acts -- makes it a rousing introduction to opera, says Arlene Saunders, founder of the troupe and director of its productions.
She heads the opera department at New York University and says that she is committed to bringing opera to young people and others who cannot afford a ticket to the Met.
The number for directions or more information is 377-6450. ELEANOR CHARLES

A Shore Where the Crowds Aren't (Don't Forget the Insect Repellent)
At the end of State Highway 55 just south of Millville, shore traffic makes a left turn and heads east for the Atlantic Ocean, even though some of New Jersey's most unspoiled coastline lies just a few miles to the south.
For many beachgoers, the turnoff may not be a bad idea.
The Delaware Bay shore, where insect repellent proves far more useful than coconut oil, is not for the faint of heart.
The beach towns shown on road maps are mostly storm-strewn ruins with only a few buildings, and the beaches themselves are frequently nowhere to be found, especially when the tide comes in.
At the end of the road, there might be a narrow strip of sand or rock or mucky sod topped with deep green marsh grass.

California Spectacular: The Snow Melt
A record Sierra snow pack is melting into shows of water in California, providing exceptional vistas for travelers, thrills for river rafters and impassable roads.
"There are a lot of places in the Sierra this year where the snow will never go away," said Dave Hart, coordinator of California's Cooperative Snow Survey, a division of the California Department of Water Resources.
Mr.
Hart called this year's accumulation -- more than twice as much as usual in some places -- one of the four biggest since 1930.


Andrea H. Nelson, Sean L. Abbott
Andrea Harris Nelson, the daughter of Suzanne Knickerbocker Colt of New York and John Harris Nelson of Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., was married yesterday to Sean Lawrence Abbott, a son of Mary M. Abbott and John L. Abbott of Mansfield Center, Conn.

She graduated magna cum laude form Columbia University and received an M.B.A. from New York University.
Her father, now retired, was a private investor.
Her mother is the deputy chief of the Family Court Division of the New York City Law Department.


A Time to Plant And Nab Worms
Start a fall crop of broccoli and Chinese cabbage, beets and carrots.
Plant heat-resistant lettuce, like Apollo, Buttercrunch and Esmeralda.
If you have trouble getting seeds, a good source is Cook's Garden, P.O.
Box 535, Londonderry, Vt. 05148.
Plant a few hills of summer squash and a few cucumber seeds.
One cuke plant is plenty, unless you are a pickle addict.
Plant another row of beans and a fall crop of basil.
Harvest the basil planted in the spring, and above all, don't let it flower. (The leaves will get a harsh resiny taste.) If you cut it back now and give it a dose of fish emulsion, it will make new leaves.

July 2-8; Finally, the Prosecution Rests
Spectators, reporters and even the defendant seemed to nod off periodically during the prosecution's 92-day case in People v.
O.
J.
Simpson.
But last week, it was the prosecution that finally rested.
Nine books and nine prosecutors, 10 dismissed jurors and 11 defense lawyers into the Simpson saga, Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark announced Thursday that the people's case was complete.
Their case ended where much of it had taken place: under a microscope -- this time examining hairs, fibers and minute shreds of cloth.
Those items, prosecutors believe, not only provide further proof that Mr.
Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman but reveal the order and manner in which he murdered them.

Braving Blisters and Fatigue in a 756-Mile Race
Driving by car from Chicago to New York would be faster, but 18 paddlers from 5 countries think that traveling by kayak makes more sense.
They are athletes with a mission to traverse seven states by way of four Great Lakes, eight rivers, a lengthy canal and two days of open ocean.


Mother Who Killed: Loss, Betrayal and a Search for a Fairy Tale Life
Her lawyers are expected to argue that Susan Smith has been the victim of destructive relationships and influences since she was born, swept helplessly through life like a cork down a quick-moving creek.
The prosecution is expected to paint her as a scheming monster who lied to her hometown and the entire world for nine days, blaming a phantom carjacker for the disappearance of her sons before confessing that she had drowned the two little boys in a dark lake.


UNTOLD WAR STORIES
James Ivory's supplement to the untold war story of balloon bombs riding the jet stream from Japan to the Pacific Northwest is off by several years (Letters, June 11).
More than 9,000 balloon bombs, the paper casings made by school children from mulberry tree pulp, under military supervision, were launched between November 1944 and April 1945.
A few hundred made it across, some as far east as Ontario and Michigan.
As the Germans were surrendering on May 5, 1945, a picnicking party of a minister, his wife and five children discovered an inert balloon in the quiet Oregon woods near Lakeview.
The Rev.
Archie Mitchell shouted, too late, "Don't touch it!" The explosion killed Mrs.
Mitchell and the children.


Two More Mexicans Are Freed In Assassination of Candidate
A former state police officer and his son were freed from Mexico's maximum-security prison early today after a judge dismissed charges that they helped assassinate the governing party's presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio.
The exoneration of the two men, Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela and his elder son, Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer, left the authorities holding only one of the five suspects they originally had charged with conspiring to kill Mr.
Colosio as he left a campaign rally in the northern city of Tijuana on March 23, 1994.


A Council Member's Dissent Should Not Cost Her Access
To The Editor:
"The Politics of a No Vote" (June 25) left me with the impression that as one of Ronnie Eldridge's constituents, I should object to her stands because they give my district less clout in the City Council.
On the contrary, I do not think that automatically following the directions of the Council Speaker is what I elected Ms.
Eldridge to do.
I want a Council member who believes that there should be open discussion in the Council Chamber and that Council members should have access to the documents they are being asked to vote on.
In both the state and city legislatures, there is far too little opportunity for the people's elected representatives to debate the merits of the bills before them.


Amy B. Jacobson, Jonathan Goldstein
Amy Beth Jacobson, the daughter of Arlene and Richard Jacobson of Plainview, L.I., is to be married today to Jonathan Howard Goldstein, a son of Michael and Elaine Goldstein of Roslyn Heights, L.I.
Rabbi Aaron Petuchowski is to officiate at the Temple Beth Sholom in Roslyn, L.I.
The bride, 25, and the bridegroom, 26, graduated from Washington University in St.
Louis.
The bride received a master's degree in education from Columbia University.
In the fall, she is to begin teaching the third grade at the Lakeville Elementary School in Great Neck, L.I.
Her father is the director of corporate taxes at Avis Inc. in Garden City, L.I.


Another Prescription Option
To the Editor:
As a former retail pharmacy owner I appreciated the information in your article.
I'd like to point out, however, that under the Federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, pharmacies are required to council patients on the use, dosage, side effects, allergies, and care of medications.


And Finally, a Word From Almost Everyone
The main thing the New Jersey Constitution absolutely requires the Legislature to do is to pass the budget on schedule, and that task has now been accomplished.
Now the members are scattered to their home districts and to their regular jobs for the summer, and the State House has begun to slip into its comfortable summer torpor.
The building crew has gone around turning off lights that once blazed day and night, and standards of dress have decayed so seriously that even some Republican staff workers are wearing chinos to work.
So with hard news on holiday, this might be a good time to confess that there were hundreds, nay, thousands of items of other news that did not get reported during the session, that was ignored or turned into jotting paper or simply swept up by someone tired of finding it underfoot.
We know it is news, becuase it says so, right there at the top of the page: "Assembly Democrats News Release," for example, and "Senate Republican News," and "Office of the Governor News Release," and so on.


Mother and 2 Girls Killed In Fire in a Queens House
A suspicious early morning blaze ripped through what the police described as an illegal boarding house in Queens yesterday, killing a mother and her two children, sending neighbors scrambling to rescue another woman and alarming neighbors who thought their own houses were on fire.
Flames roared through the front of the two-story frame house, at 104-35 134th Street, in Richmond Hill, at 5:23 A.M., engulfing the porch with so much fire that it looked like the sun setting, neighbors said.


There's No Shying From Stocks in Five Retirement Portfolios
TAKING some profits after a spectacular first half in the markets is tempting.
But for long-term holdings, like retirement money, a little fine-tuning is as far as most investment advisers will go.
Only two of the five advisers who created hypothetical retirement portfolios two years ago for The New York Times are taking any profits at midyear.
And even they are plowing money into areas of the stock market that have languished.

Multiculturalism Is Stressed in 'The Reconstructed Figure'
THE Katonah Museum of Art is cutting loose with "The Reconstructed Figure," a show by 11 contemporaries.
If anyone had thought to use the title 60 years ago, it would probably have aroused associations with Cubism.
But now, at the end of the century, it implies little more than cosmetic surgery.
Not that this association is inappropriate, for in his essay, the curator, John Beardsley, argues in favor of multiculturalism, a philosophy that threatens to succeed where the proponents of anti-art, like Duchamp, failed.
As explained by Mr.
Beardsley, Multiculturalist theory advocates a reversal whereby individuals formerly excluded from the art scene are included, and the victims get to change places with their oppressors.


Panel Urges More Effort On Domestic Violence
THE incidence of domestic violence, including violence against children, is increasing in Westchester, a county task force has reported, and no socioeconomic group is immune.
The panel recommended the creation of a Westchester Domestic Violence Council to coordinate efforts to reverse the trend and urged more training for Family Court judges.
The report was issued late last month by the task force, which was appointed last year by the Chairman of the County Board of Legislators, Stephen P. Tenore.
Following interviews with lawyers, social workers, members of the District Attorney's staff and others, the panel reached some grim conclusions.


Committee in the House Prunes the Budget Tree
As the House Appropriations Committee passes the halfway mark in writing spending bills to fulfill Republican pledges of a leaner Federal budget, the House's ruling right wing is expressing delight at what has been cut.
But it is what survives that ruffles them.
The National Endowment for the Arts, which sponsored Robert Mapplethorpe's contentious photographs of the human anatomy, is bloodied in the legislation being churned out of the appropriations panel, but the endowment is still standing.
So is the Legal Services Corporation, the Federal law firm that conservatives accuse of promoting a liberal agenda in the courts.


SUNDAY, July 9, 1995; QUESTIONS FOR: Mark Morris
Q: Can grace be taught?
A: Yes, absolutely.
I would call it coordination.
It's not just a physical thing; it's a mental thing -- to know what one part is doing while the other part is happening, to have that happen seamlessly and efficiently.
I think efficiency has to do with grace, in employing the most direct action to accomplish a task.
Like picking up a pen, or folding a piece of paper, or talking on the phone, or tying your shoe, or putting groceries in a sack: functional things.


On Top of Parkway Labor Woes Comes a Tangled Racial Dispute
The Parkway Reporter, mailed to the homes of more than 1,200 employees of the New Jersey Highway Authority, which operates the Garden State Parkway, is a typical house organ, with wedding announcements, photos of the company blood drive and profiles of toll takers.
But less typically, the publication for several years contained a column by minority employees that was often used as a sounding board for complaints about the authority's record on affirmative action.
Recently, however, the authority put an end to the column, killing one entry and notifying the author that no future submissions would be published.

NO MARTYRS IN WACO
THE EARTHQUAKE, AND I MEAN A REALLY BIG earthquake, hasn't come yet," Sheila Martin explains. "There's going to be darkness over the entire earth.
The moon's going to turn red.
Just watch it.
But the people who know the Lord, they will be the truth and the light.
They will have a glow on them, like Moses when he came down the mountain.
And that is when Wayne and the kids are coming back."
David Koresh will certainly be with them.
"Oh, yes," Martin adds, "we're looking forward to this time where the world is going to see him as he really was to us. This time people are going to hear the message that they did not get to hear in those 51 days."


California's Squabbling Legislature Just Stumbles Along
There was a time, 20 years or so back, when the Legislature here was considered one of the most professional, innovative and productive in the nation, a major force in leading California to its pre-eminence after World War II as the richest and most powerful state in the Union.
Other states looked to the Golden State for legislative example and guidance.
And then there is today's California Legislature, more specifically the lower house, the ideologically sundered, procedurally stumbling, squabbling, wobbling California Assembly.

Strawberry's Help
To the Sports Editor:
Darryl Strawberry's potential for the Yankees must be considered from the perspective of the team's particular need for help against right-handed pitchers.
Yankee fans must avoid being in denial of the reality that Don Mattingly is no longer a threatening hitter, Bernie Williams hits 75 points lower left-handed than right-handed, Wade Boggs is showing his age, and Danny Tartabull, if he plays at all, should only see left-handers.
Strawberry, even at 80 percent of his fabulous prime, is a perfect answer in this situation.

Cutting the Cost Of Calling Home
A REVOLUTION in calling home from overseas is well under way.
A decision by the Federal Communications Commission last month upheld the newest electronic gimmick, where the user dials a special number, lets it ring once, hangs up immediately and then gets a call back from a switching system that provides a dial tone.
Using this opening, the user then dials the real call, and others thereafter, circumventing both the local phone system and any hotel charges for outgoing calls.
Thus a call originating overseas is transformed into a call "placed" from the United States.
This cuts the cost because United States phone rates are cheaper and because the call-back companies buy bulk time on established phone networks.
When call-back companies' prices per call are weighed against the major telephone companies' prices for calls from overseas, the contrast appears astonishing: 76 cents a minute for a call-back call from France to the United States, contrasted with $1.70 for the first minute for a call into the United States system on one phone company's access number that is charged to the company's credit card.

Slow Start Doesn't Stop Yanks This Time
Paul O'Neill was so frustrated and tired Friday night when the Rangers humbled the Yankees by 10 runs, he spoke in a whisper about how it was one of the ugliest games he had ever seen.
One night later, O'Neill made sure the ugliness would not persist and turned a possibly ugly affair into an awesome encounter for the Yankees.
A 3-0 first-inning deficit had been erased by the seventh inning, when O'Neill opposed the left-hander Dennis Cook as a pinch-hitter with the bases full of Yankees and the score tied.

1% Inspiration at the Brewery, New Haven
THE once-white brick structure at 458 Grand Avenue in New Haven is not named the Brewery for nothing.
Not only is beer brewed there, specifically Connecticut's own Elm City brand, but also the huge stainless steel vats are visible through the building's equally huge windows.
But there is also a banqueting hall upstairs and it has just been inaugurated as an art gallery (also called the Brewery) by "One Percent Inspiration." The title comes from Thomas Edison's definition of genius as 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.


PHOTOGRAPHER'S JOURNAL


Right On
To the Editor:
The photographic essay "In a French Cave, Art Fit for a Connoisseur"  [ June 18 ]  highlights an interesting aspect of these remarkable 30,000-year-old paintings.
Almost all the animal profiles are drawn facing the observer's left.
The preponderance of left-facing images may be coincidence or it may be one of the oldest human records supporting the dominance of the right cerebral hemisphere in the realm of visual and artistic perception.
The left visual field is favored by the right brain.
This neurobiologic bias provides a more reasonable explanation of the left-right pictorial imbalance than the presumption of Stone Age artistic canons.


Eye-Popping Technology Led a Grand First Half for Funds
MUTUAL fund investors are suffering an embarrassment of riches, and they are praying that the pain never stops.
In a stretch that could have made even the most conservative managers positively giddy, mutual funds turned in a roaring second-quarter performance and have had a stellar year in only six months.
Judging by the early returns to last week's action by the Federal Reserve, which trimmed a key short-term interest rate by a quarter point, even more good times may be ahead.


Watch This Space
WHERE HUMAN ANATOMY meets data processing, there are just two important devices: the brain and the wristwatch.
The brain is nice, but it doesn't tell time very well.
So, creatures of habit that we are, we strap on that extra thing -- a machine worn every day by most adults in the industrialized world to display a single piece of data.
It's starting to look as though this may not be a particularly creative use of valuable anatomical real estate.
Technology is outpacing fashion.
Now you can buy wristwatches that tell time and . . . announce your appointments . . .  monitor your pulse and blood pressure . . . store phone numbers . . . check the air or water temperature . . . compute sums . . . play music.
There are emergency-beacon watches for pilots and at least a prototype of a matchmaking watch: put your essentials into a data base and the watch of a suitable romantic interest will blink when you draw nigh.
Besides locating you in the fourth dimension, some watches can locate you, or at least orient you, in the first three -- with altimeters, depth finders and electronic compasses.


Changing Trains


Raiders' Divorce Made in Heaven
Their fans were about leather and mace.
Their stadium was rubble, their practice facility was a deserted school and their marketing department was on wheels.
The Raiders rented in Los Angeles for 13 years, had an option to buy but, in the end, preferred to move back in with their parents (Oakland).
The legacy they leave behind is a paddy wagon.


MATRONS OF HONOR
Working in the theater district, I am reminded on matinee days of the truth of Naomi Bliven's Style essay "Matrons of Honor" (June 18).
Septuagenarians, hellbent for a good time, step out of tour buses with the same fervor (if not the same targets) as the sailors who charge up from the ships that park periodically at the Hudson River piers.

The Nabe as American Small Town
IN THE NEW MOVIE "SMOKE," SET in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, Harvey Keitel plays Auggie Wren, the street-savvy manager of the local tobacco shop.
In addition to accommodating customers like Paul Benjamin (William Hurt) with exotic cigars, Auggie pursues an odd project.
He takes snapshots of the corner in front of his store every morning at 8 and mounts them as a chronicle of more than 4,000 days.
When Paul, in bewilderment, flips through these seemingly repetitious photos, Auggie urges him to slow down, to note the differences among people, weather and light.
"It's my corner, after all," Auggie explains.
"It's just one little part of the world. But things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot."


More Water Would Have Helped


Price of Loyalty?
To the Sports Editor:
When the Devils moved to New Jersey and sought to develop a fan base there, the team required all new season subscribers to pay an upfront fee of at least $2,000, refunded at the rate of one-tenth per year, to obtain their season tickets.
Those fans who shelled out their cash for a pig in a poke showed how fan passion and loyalty for a team and its players can sometimes defy common sense.
Now that the Devils have won the Stanley Cup, those supporters may suffer the indignity of their team leaving town before they have the opportunity to revel in their championship.


Another Prescription Option
To the Editor:
"Filling Prescriptions by Mail: Not Always the Best Bargain" (Spending It, June 11) did not address the usually competitive prices available at independent community pharmacies.


For Those With the Itch to Shift
AUTOMATIC transmissions are easy.
Move the gear selector into "drive" and the transmission shifts its own gears -- a fine formula for everyday commuting.
But when a driver wants more control over the car's performance -- when driving fast, for instance, on a winding road -- an automatic makes a less than perfect partner because the driver surrenders control of the shifting to the transmission, which cannot read his or her mind.
Several auto makers are working to change this by adding a new level of driver control to automatic transmissions.
Acura, BMW and Porsche all offer vehicles equipped with such "auto-manual" transmissions, and Eagle will join them this fall.
Although each version has a different name, all function in much the same way.
In each, the transmission can operate as a normal automatic when the shift lever is in drive.
Or the driver, by moving the shifter to a special position, can override the automatic's shifting pattern and select the gears.
These are not simply clutchless manual transmissions -- like Volkswagen's "Automatic Stick Shift" of 1968-75 and various offerings in the 1940's and 50's -- but are sophisticated automatics capable of mimicking the operation of a stick shift.


July 2-8: It's the Economy, Stupid; The President Watches As the Federal Reserve Turns On the Heat, Sort of
The Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates last week in what was the latest turn in the up-and-down, arms-length relationship of a Democrat and a Republican who find their fates intertwined: Bill Clinton and the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan.
Both men, of course, want a healthy economy.
But they also have a strong interest in seeing a healthy economy next spring: Mr.
Greenspan will be up for re-appointment; Mr.
Clinton will be up for re-election.

The Ulster Minefield
Having survived a political crisis in London and a resurgence of sectarian street violence here in recent days, the peace effort for Northern Ireland now enters another dangerous period.
This is the "marching season," the time when the Protestant majority and the Roman Catholic minority throughout this British Province celebrate their separate and hostile versions of its history.
The traditional marches by tens of thousands of people could set the stage for new clashes that could set back the peace effort, which was accelerated 10 months ago with the cease-fire by the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republican Army.

New in This Section
This issue of Televison introduces some new features and some improvements on familiar ones.
You'll find channel numbers for New York City cable systems on the left side of each grid, making it easier to find the program you choose.
You may have to test them.
Once you find which number works for your cable company - say, the second from left (16 for A&amp;E and 32 for AMC) - use the number in that spot for each channel.


CHATTER: Should the Devils Stay or Go?; A Reasonable Price to Pay

Venice Biennale: Startling Songs Of the Body . . .
THE GIARDINI ARE TRANQUIL.
The Palazzo Grassi is mostly empty.
The insiders who gathered last month for the Venice Biennale, Part One: The Media Event, have given way to the plain folk who come wandering in for Part Two: The Event Itself.
Each time around it's the same, with the chattering art masses crowding into the opening to see one another, as much as anything else, and acting like Claude Rains in "Casablanca," shocked, shocked to find bad art at the Biennale.
There is much pontificating over Bellinis at Harry's Bar about what a travesty the event is.
I'm sorry, I've done it myself, but I'm in no mood this year.
Venice is too beautiful.
Maybe if I had had to wait two hours to see Bill Viola's videos at the American pavilion, as some poor souls apparently did at the opening, I'd be testier.
But a few days ago there were two people in the pavilion.
Likewise the next day, and the next.
What these meager audiences say, if anything, about popular enthusiasm for contemporary art, I don't know.
But it was very pleasant.


Union Goal of Equality Fails the Test of Time
By 7 A.M., nearly 30 men have gathered in the hiring hall of the Iron Workers Local 401.
They talk quietly in groups at small gray tables, like diners in a restaurant waiting to be served.
Several who are black sit apart.
All are waiting for a glass window at one end of the hall to slide open and the hiring boss to call out jobs.
Six times this year, the window has opened for Michael Sharpe, one of the black men.
But none of the jobs lasted long, and he has averaged only eight days of work a month, half the number this year of most white members of Local 401.
The others at his table tell similar stories.


The World; Everyone's Too Busy To Be Africa's Leader
IF continents placed want ads, Africa's current listing might read something like this: Needed, economic power center with strong political commitment to the African neighborhood and healthy democratic instincts, to help build continental prosperity.
But there would be a problem: Nobody would be applying for the job, even though the continent is not without candidates whose resumes are available.


Glorious Shade
To the Editor: Like W. D. Wetherell, I am a redhead always looking for shady refuge.
When my husband proposed a trip to Positano, Italy, the town from which his family emigrated, I was terrified -- but, remembering all the cups of tea he sipped willingly with my cousins in Ireland, I loaded up on SPF 54 sunscreen and bought a large purple hat.


Carol L. Rawn, William Mackey
Carol Lee Rawn, a prosecutor in the Massachusetts Attorney General's office in Boston, was married yesterday to William Timothy Mackey, a landscape architect in Cambridge, Mass.
The Rev.
Thomas Cleveland, an Episcopal priest who is the chaplain of the Milton Academy, performed the ceremony at Penzance Point in Woods Hole, Mass.
Ms.
Rawn, who is keeping her name, graduated from Middlebury College and received her law degree from the University of Virginia.
She specializes in environmental law.
She is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Her father is the chief executive of the Noel Group, a venture capital concern in New York.


Life on the Loaf
To the Editor:
As the new director of the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, I read Meghan Daum's essay with keen interest.
Ms.
Daum quotes from last year's Bread Loaf brochure ("not . . . a place where you write, but one where you talk . . . about writing") to describe a tradition that has discouraged participants from writing while attending the conference.
As I look forward to my first session as conference director in August, I invite Ms.
Daum and others to consider a Bread Loaf whose current brochure informs participants that "writing, and the passion for writing, will be the focus of the conference," along with "a new emphasis on workshops and classroom discussion."  MICHAEL COLLIER  Middlebury, Vt.


Nicole Burman, Jeffery S. Sichel
Nicole Burman, the daughter of Margaret and Sheldon V. Burman of New York, is to be married today to Jeffery Stuart Sichel, a son of Joyce L. Sichel of Dallas and Michael Sichel of Somers, N.Y.
Rabbi Shelley Becker is to perform the ceremony at the couple's apartment in New York.
The bride, 29, is to be known as Nicole Burman-Sichel.
She and the bridegroom, 27, are the artistic directors of the Empty Space Theater Company in Manhattan, which the bridegroom founded.
The bride graduated from Barnard College.
Her father is a lawyer and her mother is a novelist, both in New York.


Woman, Bugged by Gnats, Vows Vengeance
IN a house with a sweeping view of rural Hunterdon County, in a tiny subdivision off narrow roads where geese still demand the right of way, Gretchen Baldwin has actually appeared outside in a floppy hat with strips of Bounce fabric-softener sheets taped to the brim.
"The sheets work," she said glumly the other day.
"A lot of people use them. Not breathing outside also helps. But neither solution is very practical."


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
Smooth-Flying Food
ON her first day as a waitress at a new restaurant in Southold, Sandi Tarpey, 17, was learning two important facts -- how much to charge for a hamburger and how to keep from crashing into the customers.
Miss Tarpey had just become a roller-skating waitress, a carhop at Hubba Hubba, a drive-in in Southold.
"I find I go so fast," she said, "that I realized I had to learn to steer or I'd just keep heading into the cars or out into the road."
After a few hours of juggling her steers Miss Tarpey had it down to a science.
She was able to carry her tray filled with hamburgers, fries and sodas and perform skating tricks at the same time.
"You still have to watch the pebbles, though," she said.
"You hit one, and you jerk and its, 'Whoa with the soda!' "


SUNDAY, July 9, 1995; FINE ARTS: Road Runner in the Park
Dinosaurs are having another one of their endless heydays at the Museum of Natural History; the Museum of Modern Art is showing paintings by 70 women, and Edward Hopper is at the Whitney.
But what to do on a hot day in Manhattan if you absolutely have to see some carved wildfowl?
Luckily, Phillips Petroleum has its collection of carved birds on display at the Central Park Conservancy's Charles A. Dana Discovery Center at 110th Street just off Fifth Avenue.
The exhibit includes the road runner at left, by Richard Finch, screech owls, scissor-tailed flycatchers and other birds.


LOOKING FOR A DONOR TO CALL DAD
The first time I read Orenstein's article, I was "on table," resting in a clinic after having been inseminated with my brother-in-law's sperm.
I came to New York to have this procedure because, in France, donor insemination with a "directed or known donor" is illegal.


Amy Salesin and Adam Gershwin
Amy Elizabeth Salesin, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Michael Salesin of West Bloomfield, Mich., was married last evening to Adam David Gershwin, a son of Andrea Gershwin and Marc Gershwin, both of New York.

North Carolina Celebrates Its Heritage
For two days later this month, North Carolina will showcase its cultural resources with "Museum Magic," a festival of exhibitions and demonstrations in Raleigh.
Three museums -- the North Carolina Museum of Art, the Museum of History and the Museum of Natural Sciences -- have collaborated in organizing the event.
The Museum of Natural Sciences will present a lecture about wetland animals and courses in waterfowl calling, creating ponds, and fly fishing.
"Freshwater Wetlands," the museum's permanent exhibition, depicts wetlands plants and animals in naturalistic habitats, and includes a walk-through diorama of the Roanoke River bottom lands in the spring.


PRESENT SHOCK
How can Heidi Toffler expect to be taken seriously when she uses astrology to explain the personality differences between her husband and herself?
She ought to refrain from such remarks as: "Al is a Libra, he's more balanced and less of a social animal. I'm a Leo, an individual." MADALYN MARGOLES New York


In the Region/Westchester;
ON a 56-acre campus at this city's highest point, a full-scale retirement community is being built to attract affluent elderly people, especially those now living in their own homes in surrounding areas.
The glossy brochure for the project, Sterling Park at the Osborn, shows well-turned-out silver-haired couples strolling through opulent interiors, dining al fresco or swimming in the pool.

Q and A
Grand Canyon of Spain Q.  In 1978 my wife and I went to Spain and visited El Chorro de Gargantua, or the Grand Canyon of Spain, north of Malaga, and found it to be an extraordinary experience.

A Yard of Cloth, A Mile of Versatility
A piece of clothing that is key to this summer's sportswear mix is the sleeve-less blue jean jacket.
The jacket, in a new abbreviated look that's a cross be-tween a bolero and a vest, uses little more than a yard of cloth and still has all the traditional construction.
The denim jackets, costing under $50, are worn with every style of trousers and all dress lengths.


4,700 and Coping With High Anxiety
THE stock market has zoomed skyward this year, with the major stock indexes all up more than 20 percent since the end of 1994.
The Dow Jones industrial average topped 4,600 for the first time ever on Wednesday, and then exceeded 4,700 just two days later.
And this move is just continuing a bull market that erupted 13 years ago.
If you've owned stocks for much of that period, you've probably done better than you ever dreamed possible.
You may also be getting a bit nervous.
Can such good things last forever?
Should you take some of your chips off the table?
And if so, how?


Now About Those Weeds, Before It's Too Late
SOMEONE once defined a weed as a "plant out of place." Often enough, quite right.
Many respected wild flowers are thought of as weeds.
Beauty seems to be in the eye of the beholder.
The temptation is to consider these plants as botanical intruders.
But one thought should be in the weeds' favor.
Many of them have had vital roles in the establishment of civilizations over the centuries.
In a certain sort of way, weeds deserve some respect.


Saving a Wilderness for Tourists,and More Endangered Species
It is hard to imagine a landscape of more jarring contrasts.
A river thick with organic debris zigzags slowly across a lush, marshy plain teeming with life.
Less than 1,000 feet away, behind a stand of pines, sits a vast, blasted-out desert, humps of exposed sand surrounding a crystal-clear dredging pond that glows an unearthly bluish-green in the sun.
This is the Manumuskin Preserve, 3,257 acres of primeval river, pine-oak forest and abandoned sand mines near the state's southwestern edge.
A month ago, after a long and tangled land-use struggle, it was acquired by the Nature Conservancy, the environmental group that buys land all over the country to preserve it forever.


Cavers Uncover Faith in Heart of Darkness
We arrived in bright sunshine.
The previous night's thunderstorms had left this area of upstate New York particularly lush.
We were five city slickers looking for a way to celebrate summer.
What better way than to crawl into the darkness of Mother Nature's belly?
We were going caving in one of the 200 caves said to be in the county.
After hiking into the woods, past the honeysuckle and pines, we spotted a ladder sticking out of the earth.
Standing nearby were four cavers covered from helmet to hiking boots in mud.
Some of the life that is attracted to the water at the mouths of caves was attacking their foreheads.
As we swatted the savage mosquitoes, we asked for any advice the cavers had to offer.


Melanie Shulman, Marc A. Feigen
Dr.
Melanie Shulman, the Javits Fellow in behavioral neurology at Boston University, was married last evening to Marc Alan Feigen, a management consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company in New York.
Rabbi Richard S. Chapin performed the ceremony at Temple Emanu-El in New York.
The bride, 31, graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University and received a master's degree in the history of medicine from St.
John's College in Cambridge, Mass.
She received her M.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania.
She is a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Abraham Shulman of Hollis Hills, Queens.
Her father, a professor emeritus of otolaryngology at the State University Health Sciences Center in Brooklyn, is the founder and director of the Martha Entenmann Tinnitus Center in Brooklyn.
The bride's mother, Arlene Shulman, is the leadership chairwoman for the Queens region of Hadassah.


Taxables Heat Up; Munis Crawl Under a Wet Blanket
Talk about a turnaround.
Bond fund investors who were burned last year -- and that includes just about everyone who owned a bond fund -- might be astounded to learn that no taxable bond funds lost money in this year's second quarter.
And near the top of the list of stars are some Latin American specialists that were whacked only a few quarters ago.
The best performers over the first six months, meanwhile, have been the Benham Target funds that bet on zero-coupon Treasury bonds with the longest possible maturities.
Those bonds are among the most volatile available, but, as this year's numbers demonstrate, they do extraordinarily well during bond market rallies.


Indurain Stuns Tour, Blasting Into Second
In a virtuoso display of strength and bravado, Miguel Indurain unexpectedly sped away today in the Tour de France, moving up to second place over all and gaining more than a minute on his main rivals.
He may also have turned tomorrow's first major test, a long individual ride against the clock, on its head.
The only thing Indurain failed to do after his breakaway was win the long, hard and hot seventh stage, 203 kilometers (126 miles) in Belgium from Charleroi to Liege.


The Games of Morning (Grunt. Thwack.)
LIVE sports action invades Sunday morning television this month.
Championship tennis with thwacks and grunts.
Grainy golf transmissions from Scotland.
Put off the morning walk and set up the tray tables, breakfast is served in the den.
What is all this?
Sunmday mornings are for leisurely brunches or family trips to church.
Live sports, sports that matter, not the usual round-the-clock cable fare of taped auto races and beach volleyball, might seem like a jarring intrusion on a wekend morning routine, like anything that seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.


It's Alive


In Williamsburg, A Mighty Life For a Captive
This is the day of the big lift, when both the boat and giglio are hoisted, and anyone who doesn't knwo what that means is not familiar enough with the combined feast of our Lady of Mount Carmel and St.
Paulinus in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.
The feast, now under way at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Roman Catholic Church at North Eighth and Havemeyer Streets in Williamsburg and running until July 16, commemorates the release in the fifth century of St.
Paulinus, the Bishop of Nola, Italy, from captivity among the Vandals.
St.
Paulinus had volunteered to be a captive in place of a child so that the child's mother, a widow, could have her only son back.


At Concordia Finale, Old Plus the New
FOR the last two weeks in Bronxville, Concordia College's first Keyboard Clinic has brought students and the public an almost daily bonanza of master classes, open rehearsals, panel discussions and concert performances.
This afternoon at 3, a premiere and two piano concertos highlight the grand finale in the Sommer Center.
Joan Forsyth, director of the clinic (as well as of the college's Music Preparatory Department) will be the soloist in one of the concertos -- the Beethoven Third -- while Mozart is the composer in a showcase performance by the winner of the clinic's student competition.

To the Sports Editor:

And where were the Yankee scouts when Mo Vaughn and John Valentin were tearing up the college leagues while playing for Seton Hall?


SUNDAY, July 9, 1995; AMERICAN HISTORY: The Thing With Feathers
When Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the Interior (bottom right), signed an agreement this spring to buy more than 100,000 acres on Kodiak Island in Alaska from two native corporations, he donned native headgear.
He wore an Alutiiq whaler's hat given to him two years ago, which he had saved for the occasion.
Babbitt is only the latest in a long tradition of happy warriors, as the photographs show.
Presidents, Governors, Senators -- even Mayor Fiorello La Guardia have worn ceremonial American Indian gear.
John F. Kennedy, who hated hats, didn't put the headdress on but only posed with it held over his head.
As for President Clinton, the White House press office says it has no photographs of the President wearing feathers.
Furthermore, a spokesman said, if such a photo did exist, the office would not release it.

Squeaky Wheels: Group Gets Results
When transit officials devised subway and bus cuts this year, the Upper East Side was among the first and best organized neighborhoods springing into action, fighting to preserve local service.
That was no accident.
Leading the charge was the Upper East Side's not-so-secret weapon, the East 79th Street Neighborhood Association.
Founded in 1984 to campaign for a Sunday bus on York Avenue, the group has since grown into a major influence on a wide array of local issues.


BEIJING ARRESTS RIGHTS DEFENDER
Harry Wu, a Chinese-American human rights campaigner known for his daring and secretive travels through China to document prison labor abuses, was charged with espionage today.
Mr.
Wu has been detained since June 19, when Chinese border authorities discovered his identity at a remote checkpoint in western China as he entered the country from Kazakhstan with an associate.


A Breakdown On the Highway To the Moon
Species Ben Kingsley, Natasha Henstridge, Michael Madsen Directed by Roger Donaldson R 111 minutes
When scientists fabricate a segment of D.N.A. from instructions sent from outer space and combine that with a human egg, they create Sil, the half-female, half-alien creature they keep ina secret lab.
Sil (in human form, Ms. Henstridge) escapes and specialists give chase.
The problem is that in weeks Sil matures from a young girl to a grown woman, eager to reproduce.
And she has a nasty temper when crossed.


Expect the Unexpected: Spread the Risk
WHAT if the optimists are wrong?
What if the economy crash lands?
Or what if it booms -- and the Federal Reserve jacks up interest rates again, instead of easing them as it did Thursday?
And, to raise a specter that is haunting millions of Americans, what if another stock-market meltdown interrupts the Dow Jones Industrial Average's seemingly unstoppable march to 5,000?


Pepsico Starts a Health Clinic in Russia
WHY is Pepsico in the health care business in Moscow?
Not far from the Kremlin is an American outpatient clinic run by U.S.
Global Health, the offspring of a joint venture among Pepsi World Trading, Presbyterian Health Services and the Fund for Large Enterprises in Russia.
"There are several strong reasons why we got involved in health care in Russia," said James D. Gerwin, senior trader at the World Trade Company, a Pepsico subsidiary in Somers.
"Why? Because we are always looking at unusual projects that will guarantee us a flow of foreign exchange in tough territories, but more importantly because we recognized a need for a quality health care facility in Moscow."


A Cresting Wave of Change, Powered by Condominiums
Two years ago, Bob Sales moved into his bi-level unit at the St.
Charles Condominiums, a new city-subsidized development for lower- middle-class families.
He has been keeping track of his new neighborhood since.
To him, the changes around thefour complexes on Frederick Douglass Boulevard between 136th and 138th Streets have been gradual: a jazz restaurant two blocks down, Londel's, is eight months old, there's an ATM on 135th Street near Fifth Avenue now, and storefronts are being built on 135th.
And more changes are coming: within a year, 53 families will be buying into the new Bradhurst Apartments, a block away.


Aid Packages For Retailers In Poor Areas
Hoping to replicate New York City's success over the last decade in rebuilding abandoned housing, the Giuliani administration for the first time will offer packages of vacant land and financing to develop retail stores along some of the city's most blighted commercial strips.
The administration wants to spur the opening of dozens of neighborhood businesses -- groceries, pharmacies, video stores, laundries and restaurants -- that officials and housing experts say are essential to the revival of poor neighborhoods where the city has built thousands of affordable homes for working families.


Miss Hill, Mr. Sardera-Schneider
Susannah Wyatt Hill, a daughter of Nancy and Dr.
Lucius Hill of Exeter, N.H., was married there yesterday to Esteban Sardera-Schneider, a son of Esteban and Regine Sardera of New York.
Dr.
Robert Shaw, a Unitarian minister, performed the ceremony at the bride's parents' house.
The bride, 30, is a consultant at Renaissance Solutions Inc., a management consulting company in Lincoln, Mass.
She graduated from Brown University and received an M.B.A. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Her father is a general surgeon who practices in Exeter.
Her mother is a psychologist for the public schools in Portsmouth, N.H.


Sports of The Times; Nelson Isn't Enough for 30-Something Knicks
IN his inaugural address, Don Nelson proclaimed that the Knicks as currently constituted "can still win a championship," that the team is stocked with "both good older players and good younger players," that the "middle-aged players are still productive." And when he was reminded that Knick loyalists were used to a winning team, he smiled.
"I'm glad they're used to it," the new coach said, "because they're going to get more of it."


DIARY
THE ECONOMY Rates: Can't They Get It Right?
You'd think that with today's computers, which can land a space ship on the head of a T-bill, economists could simply figure out where interest rates should be -- and leave them alone, for heaven's sake.
But no: it's up and down, up and down, with incessant speculation beforehand and the actual changes heralded by 1,427 trumpets (adjusted for inflation).
So it was that on Thursday the Fed, having decided that all those rate increases over the past year and a half may have tipped the economy toward recession, sent one key rate down a notch.
It took its time, though: the free market had started sending things like bond yields and mortgage rates down some time ago.


Backlash
To the Editor:
As a professor of women's studies at the City University of New York, I would like to reply to Wendy Kaminer's essay "Feminism's Third Wave: What Do Young Women Want?" (June 4).


Life on the Loaf
To the Editor:
I was greatly impressed and amused by Meghan Daum's essay on the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference ("Life on the Loaf: Two Weeks at the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference," June 11).
Ms.
Daum clearly has the literary gift and, in particular, the sensitivity to the definitive social detail needed to become the successful writer she aspires to be.
However, she is mistaken in her claim that the practice of awarding full scholarships to promising young writers in exchange for their service as waiters began in 1956.


The World; Remember the British Voter?
TO David Ayres, a real estate agent in this town 30 miles east of London, the debate within the governing Conservative Party last week had an air of unreality about it, as if he were watching a parallel political universe.
Not that Mr.
Ayres was entirely uninterested. (The Tories were bickering over whether to dump John Major as Prime Minister; as it turned out, they didn't.) But above all, Mr.
Ayres has come to believe that the Tories, after nearly 16 years in power, have simply lost touch with the electorate.


Lyme Tick Study's Funds Run Out
THE only laboratory in Westchester County doing field ecology research on the ticks that carry Lyme disease has run out of money, despite a promise of $180,000 from the state last fall to continue the researchers' work at Purchase College.
The cutoff in state funds at Fordham University's Calder Ecology Center in Armonk comes at a time when a new tick-borne illness with potentially more deadly consequences than Lyme disease has found a foothold in the county.


Commercial Property/Sheepshead Bay; Should There Be a Fishing Village or a Loehmann's?
IT seemed like a great idea, way back when.
Take Sheepshead Bay, with its active deep-sea fishing fleet, broad promenade and protected bay; add a few more seafood restaurants and nautical shops; keep mundane stores out, and voila: A nautically themed magnet for fishing buffs and tourists, right on Brooklyn's southern shore.
At least, that's what city planners envisioned in 1973, when they created the Special Sheepshead Bay District, a 20-block tract from Sheepshead Bay Road to Knapp Street.
Emmons Avenue, running along the water and home of Lundy's seafood restaurant, was to be the district's cultural heart.


A Summer At Camp: Arriving; Short Sheets, and a Long Way From Home
Soon after popping off the bus for the first day at sleep-away camp, Sarah J. Silverberg, 10, of Great Neck, L.I., realized that her blue bag with her stuffed rabbit puppet Peter was missing, and she began to cry, pushing her blonde hair out of her eyes.
"But it had all my stuff in it!" Sarah sobbed.


Lending New Force to the Term Eclectic
STAMFORD'S restaurant row has spilled over from Summer Street into Park Place, where the newest addition is a modern, gallery-like space with a pared-back look: wood floors, colorful abstract art on sponge-painted oyster-white walls.
"Eclectic cuisine" states the Park Place menu, and it is, featuring dishes and ingredients from Japan, Mexico, Peru, Italy and France, among others.
For example, a generously packed shrimp quesadilla came with smoked Gouda cheese, a twist that gave the Mexican appetizer a new kick.
Adorned with sour cream and a chunky, sharply flavored guacamole and salad greens, this was a delicious starter.


CHATTER: Should the Devils Stay or Go?; The Door Is Open
I would welcome the New Jersey Devils.


Berlin to Paris, With an All-Important Stopover in Brooklyn
WILLIAM HURT IS IN Brooklyn again, but he's not playing the cigar aficionado he portrayed in "Smoke." On a warm evening at the end of May on St.
James Place, in Fort Greene, a crew member is hosing down the sidewalk for another take of a scene from Chantal Akerman's forthcoming film, "A Couch in New York."
The romantic comedy, written by the Belgian Ms.
Akerman and the French screenwriter Jean-Louis Benoit, stars Mr.
Hurt as a psychoanalyst who trades his Manhattan high-tech apartment for a bohemian abode in Paris.
The apartment belongs to a young French dancer played by Juliette Binoche.
After 8 weeks of shooting interiors in Berlin, the production moved to New York for 15 days (three of them in Brooklyn) and from there will go to Paris.


Cold Soups That Lift Summer Appetites
SUMMER demands cold soup.
What could be more colorful, flavorful and refreshing for heat-flagged appetites?
And what a boon for the cook.
Cold soups can be made in advance and need only minimal attention before serving.


A Host of New Insights From 'The Homecoming'
To the Editor:
Alvin Klein's review of "The Homecoming," by Harold Pinter (June 25), carried me back 30 years, when I first saw the play in London.


A Sliver of Scotland For Lairds and Cows
IT'S disconcerting to discover that the most southerly of the Inner Hebrides lies south of Glasgow, Scotland, and as the crow flies, is only 56 miles away.
For the rest of us it's a slow 110 miles, even in late September, up Loch Lomond, down Loch Fyne and south down the long proboscis of Kintyre, until, 20 miles short of Campbeltown, you reach Tayinloan where the car ferry sails to Gigha (GEE-uh, with a hard G), three miles distant.
The new car ferry is surprisingly large.
Too large, some think, for Gigha's one road, where cars oblige bicyclists to dismount.
A sign encourages visitors to leave cars on the mainland and rent a bike on the island.
My husband and I felt rather guilty in our rented Vauxhall.


Victoria LaMarca, Paul Saunders Jr.
Victoria Marie LaMarca, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Charles A. LaMarca of Glen Cove, L.I., was married yesterday to Paul Christopher Saunders Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Saunders of New York.
The Rev.
Leo J. O'Donovan, the president of Georgetown University, performed the Roman Catholic Ceremony at the Church of St.
Thomas More in New York.
Mrs.
Saunders, 23, and her husband, 24, graduated from Georgetown, she cum laude and he magna cum laude.
She is a registered nurse.
Her father is an otolaryngologist in Middle Village, Queens.

Swimmingly, Thanks; At 67, John Sarkos, Lifeguard, Has Rescued Nearly Everyone
JOHN SARKOS has the kind of squint in his eye that suggests that if he hasn't seen everything, he's certainly seen enough.
"I've seen planes crash and wash up," he said.
"I've seen plenty of whales come close to the beach. Dolphin. Elephants, too. Clyde Beatty once had his circus on Million Dollar Pier and he had to give the elephants a bath somewhere, so they took them right down at Arkansas Avenue."
After a pause, he added, "The environmental concerns were a little different back then."


'Kid Twist' Took the Fall, But He Left His Bag Behind
To The Editor:
To follow your report, "Ill-Fated Stool Pigeon's Roost Finally Following Him Down" (May 28): When the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island is demolished, New York will still retain a memento of the late if unlamented Abe (Kid Twist) Reles.
At the City Archives on Chambers Street, an institution filled with millions of pieces of paper recording the city's history breath by breath, I was shown a small, drab suitcase left behind by Reles in the moment of his death.
No one on the otherwise knowledgeable staff could tell me how the archives came to possess this treasure, but they told me it has been there longer than any of them.

July 2-8: Armed in the U.S.A.; Virginia Is Latest to Allow Concealed Weapons
County police departments in Virginia began fingerprinting and photographing thousands of state residents last week.
No lawbreakers, these average citizens were arming themselves.
Virginia became the sixth state this year and the 25th overall to relax regulations for those seeking a permit to carry a concealed handgun.
Under new procedures, any resident without a felony conviction or mental disability is virtually assured of getting the permit.


Sarah Klagsbrun, Eric S. Weinstein
Sarah Devora Klagsbrun, the daughter of Francine and Dr.
Samuel Klagsbrun of New York, is to be married this evening to Eric Scott Weinstein, a son of Anita and Barry Weinstein, also of New York.
Rabbi Harlan J. Wechsler is to officiate at the Rainbow Room in New York.
Ms.
Klagsbrun, 25, is keeping her name.
She will be a second-year medical student at the Albert Einstein Medical College in the fall.
She graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University.


SUNDAY, July 9, 1995; TRAVEL: Band on the Roll
The band is called Bicycle and it plays a combination of heavy metal, folk and rap music, with a wink.
It's striking out on its first cross-country tour -- by bicycle.
The guitarist's mom, driving ahead, will haul the instruments in a pop-up camper.
The band members (in their 20's) are oddly well behaved.
They don't smoke, and, says the drummer, "It's kind of embarrassing, but none of us has a drug problem."

Attention, D-Mart shoppers!
The Democratic National Committee has put out a catalogue with its exciting new fall collection from the White House. (Political-machine washable and made in the U.S.A.)


July 2-8; City Hall's Going Retail in Wholesale Fashion
FOR America's cities, times are certainly tough.
The cost of municipal government is rising.
The Federal Government and state capitals are slashing aid.
The mere mention of a tax hike sends politicians scurrying for political cover.
What are cash-strapped cities to do?
The answer for some time now has been for cities to get into business for themselves, but now the notion of municipal entrepreneurship has taken hold with such force that it's getting hard to keep track of its many variants.


Eva Z. Zion, Michael A. Salzhauer
Eva Zafira Zion, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Israel Zion of Brooklyn, is to be married today in Lawrence, L.I., to Michael Alexander Salzhauer, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Rabbi Chananya Elbaz is to perform the ceremony at Temple Israel of Lawrence.


For Women, Better V.A. Care
When Colleen Sambucci-Mussolino joined the Army as a cook in 1965, she was prepared for the rigors of military life.
But nothing could have prepared her for the ordeal she endured on an Army base in Alabama and the subsequent years of emotional pain.
Ms.
Sambucci-Mussolino said she was raped by four soldiers at Fort McClellan that year.
And the medical care for her physical and emotional wounds was woefully inadequate, she said.
An ectopic pregnancy went undiagnosed until it became gangrenous and was about to rupture.
She underwent emergency surgery in July 1966.


A Breakdown On the Highway To the Moon

Shirley Temple
"The Little Princess" is the 1939 version of Frances Hodgson Burnett's tale, with boarding school when her father goes to war.
Also part of this series is "The Little Colonel," with Miss Temple as the stubborn Miss Lloyd Sherman, who lives with her irascible grandfather (Lionel Barrymore) in Kentucky in the 1870's.


Pulsipher Tames Pirates, But Mets Are Even Meeker
Maybe Bobby Bonilla should say the Mets need more hitting every night.
Bill Pulsipher wouldn't mind.
The 21-year-old rookie left-hander pitched another strong game tonight, but again had nothing to show for it.
He was shaky early, almost escaped a no-out, bases-loaded situation in the third, and then retired 11 Pirates in a row at one point.
But Pittsburgh rode a two-out, two-run single from Don Slaught in the third, plus a run in the seventh inning, to a 3-2 victory at Three Rivers Stadium.


Teen-Agers Enlisted In War on Graffiti
The newest recruits in Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's war against graffiti are fresh-faced teen-agers -- kids themselves easily pictured holding cans of spray paint.
And that is the point.
Standing with five junior high school students in an East Harlem hardware store yesterday, the Mayor and the Consumer Affairs Commissioner, Alfred Cerullo 3d, announced an anti-graffiti initiative aimed at businesses flouting the ban on spray paint sales to minors.


Seles Plans to Return In Time for U.S. Open
Two years and two months after being stabbed in the back during a tournament, Monica Seles said today that her mental anxiety was finally under control and at age 21 she was about to return to tennis.
At one point in a news conference, the former No. 1 player said she "planned" to play in the United States Open, which begins on Aug. 28 in Flushing Meadows.
At another, she said she "hoped" to play in the Open.


Glorious Shade
To the Editor: Thank you for having the courage to tackle a subject of great importance to those of us who, after a summer in the sun, can at best boast of achieving a deep rich pink.
W.
D.
Wetherell's description of the travails and pleasures of us whose skin tone is best described as pigment-challenged was right on point.
All our lives we are put down for not joining the fun in the sun.
Somehow we don't see the joy or beauty of being blistered, feeling sun-stroked and squinting constantly while we walk around slathered with so much emollient we resemble a greased-up uncooked turkey with sunglasses ready for the oven.


Jill M. Connors, Joseph E. Cooper
Jill Mary Connors, the deputy editor of American Homestyle and Gardening magazine in New York, was married on Monday to Joseph Edward Cooper, the founder and director of Sail for Kids, a nonprofit educational and sailing organization, also in New York.
Judge Edward M. Keller of Michigan District Court in Standish performed the ceremony at the bride's family's cottage in Tawas City, Mich.
Mrs.
Cooper, 38, graduated from Pennsylvania State University.
She is a daughter of Dr.
Donald R. Connors of Bethel Park, Pa., and the late Helen R. Connors.
The bride's father, a nuclear physicist, is the manager of environmental affairs at Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory in West Mifflin, Pa.
Her mother owned Bethel Book Barter, a bookstore in Bethel Park.

CHATTER: Should the Devils Stay or Go?; Improved Image
New Jersey should definitely keep the Devils here.
I lived in Minnesota when the North Stars packed up and left for Dallas.
The state was stunned.
When you talk about Minnesota, the home of the American Hockey Hall of Fame, but without a professional hockey team, you're talking about a major black eye.


Two Ways to Travel From Screen to Stage
WE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE uneasy relations between the sexes and between the races, between parent and child and between lover and lover: what about the knotty, uneasy relations between stage and screen?
Life was simpler when they both knew their place.
The stage was the august and venerable ruler of the performing arts; film was the upstart and parvenu, raiding plays for material, actors and prestige.
The play was the message; the movie was the medium and handmaiden.
But that was in another time.
Film has long since become a self-sufficient art and has long since eclipsed theater as mass entertainment.
Plays are now busy bootlegging film techniques and effects.
They are even bootlegging film scripts; witness the short-lived "On the Waterfront" and the still-running (how long, O Lord, how long?) "Sunset Boulevard." We do live in the age of the makeover and the adaptation.
Call it homage, call it pastiche, call it ironic commentary, but painters, photographers, composers and directors are all obsessed with reworking old masters and old chestnuts.
When this works, and why, is worth thinking about.


Over the Sea To Skye, On a Toll Bridge
IN terms of pure romance, probably no place exerts such a hold on the imagination of voyager and highlander alike as the Isle of Skye, the largest of the Inner Hebrides.
The mystical island is forever linked to the lure of escape across the water and refuge, epitomized by the flight of Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1746 and the haunting Scottish ballad "Over the Sea to Skye."
Ever since the days of the Viking hegemony in A.D. 800 -- and before, for that matter -- the only way to get here has been by boat.
Never mind that the strait between Kyle of Lochalsh on the mainland and Kyleakin is disappointingly narrow, enough almost to yell across were it not for the howling wind.
Tourists delight in pouring aboard the small ferry for the 10-minute ride, sometimes even singing: "Speed bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing."


Urbanites Get Back to the Land (Dirty Fingernails Optional)
When Jean-Paul Courtens sent the first crops from his upstate farm into Manhattan, he knew consumers would go crazy for his tomatoes, strawberries, turnips and peas.
But when he started talking about turning New Yorkers into farmers, people told him he was nuts.
"The city? Those people could never have a relationship with the land," other farmers told Mr.
Courtens, who has been growing fruits and vegetables in Columbia County since 1987.


Losing One's Bearings, Gaining One's Self-Esteem
BROOKLYN -- Like Californians who were in the middle of earthquakes or New Yorkers remembering the night John Lennon was killed, every Lubavitch Hasid has a story about where he was last year when he first heard that Rabbi Menachem Schneerson, affectionately known as the Rebbe, had died.
Chaim Marcus, 23, got the news by cellular telephone in a car on the F.D.R.
Drive.
He hung up, pulled over and ripped his blazer, following a traditional form of mourning.
He later found out that the custom was to rip one's coat at the funeral.


Graf Wins Wimbledon, Again


Tiny Fetus at the Edge of Survival: Save It or Not?
Perhaps no area of medicine has made such astonishing advances as neonatology, the study and care of the newborn.
Every day, doctors resuscitate the tiniest infants, using oxygen masks and chest compressions, and rush them to the intensive care unit, where the latest technology can turn 24-week-old, 1-pound-4-ounce fetuses into "miracle babies," destined to live for 80 years.
But occasionally an infant is saved in the delivery room only to face months of painful and costly care, which may simply prolong its dying or -- perhaps worse -- usher it into a life of devastating handicaps: blindness, chronic lung disease, mental retardation, cerebral palsy.
Moreover, the technology is so new that doctors can no longer predict which borderline babies will thrive and which will not.
Staring at a 24-week infant, physicians cannot say whether the baby will grow up relatively unscathed or whether he will grow up unable to eat, walk or talk while his family provides lifelong care.

Anastasia McLaughlin, Michael Slattery
Anastasia Bradley McLaughlin, a daughter of Dolores and H. J. McLaughlin of Cherry Hill, N.J., was married yesterday to Michael Slattery, a son of Mary and Denis Slattery of Ballinree, Ireland.
The Rev.
William A. Scafidi performed the ceremony at St.
Patrick's Cathedral in New York.
Mrs.
Slattery, 36, is a vice president and an assistant general counsel at the United States Trust Company in New York.
She graduated from Rosemont College and received her law degree from New York Law School.
Her father retired as the president of the City and Suburban Gas Company, an energy conservation concern in Cherry Hill.

V. E. Sternberg, David C. Gottlieb
Victoria Elizabeth Sternberg, the daughter of Alexandra Langner of Ossining, N.Y., is to be married there today to David Carl Gottlieb, the son of Jerome Gottlieb of Hauppauge, L.I., and the late Bette Gottlieb.
Rabbi Jeffrey Wert is to perform the ceremony at the home of the bride's mother and stepfather, Jay B. Langner.
The bride, 29, was until recently the operations manager of Robert A. Becker Inc., an advertising agency in New York.
She graduated from the University of Michigan.
Her mother retired as an executive recruiter at Battalia Winston &amp; Associates, an executive search firm in New York.
The bride's stepfather is the president of the Hudson General Corporation, an aviation services company in Great Neck, L.I., and the chairman of the board of trustees of Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.


Welcoming Summertime Guests for Four Generations
Seventy-two years ago, Peter and Edna Chatell started a tradition that has endured through four generations of their family.
As their granddaughter, Georgia Brothers, remembers, "I can't ever recall not having Fresh Air kids around in the summer."
Since 1966, Georgia and her husband, Hubert, have played host to at least two Fresh Air Fund children each summer at their home in DeKalb Junction, N.Y., in St.
Lawrence County.
But her family's relationship with the fund has deeper roots, going back not only to the Chatells, her maternal grandparents, who took their first Fresh Air child in 1923, but also to her paternal grandparents, Earl and Elva Moulton, who started being hosts around 1930.

Correction
An article on June 25 about the rerelease of Luis Bunuel's 1967 movie "Belle de Jour" misidentified the director of the 1963 film "Les Carabiniers." He was Jean-Luc Godard, not Roberto Rossellini.
Rossellini was a co-writer for the film, with Mr.
Godard.

Ordeal of the Fire Island Parking Permits
AFTER years of trying to find ways to get on and off Fire Island in the winter Margaret Tannen, a single mother living year-round in Fair Harbor, has obtained one of the 145 off-season driving permits for the Fire Island National Seashore.
Life was "a nightmare" for the three years that she spent on the waiting list, she said.
Ms.
Tannen could not go to her doctor in Manhattan, lost her job as a security guard, was unable to take courses to be certified as a health-care worker and had problems entering her son in an enrichment program at C. W. Post College in Brentwood.


Just Two Summers Later, It's Winter for the Chinese
In the summer of 1993, athletes from China known as Ma's Army overthrew the sport of women's distance running with performances that were equally stunning and suspicious.
Two years later, the fall of the Chinese runners has been as extraordinary as their rise.
Coached by the stern, flamboyant Ma Junren, the Chinese women obliterated world records at 1,500 meters, 3,000 meters and 10,000 meters at the National Games in Beijing, attributing their phenomenal success to high-altitude and high-volume training, along with herbal diets of worm fungus and turtle soup.


Tale of Two Highways
A key issue at the heart of last week's labor trouble on the New Jersey Turnpike is the Turnpike Authority's desire to bring overtime in line with what is paid to collectors on the Garden State Parkway.

Turnpike workers resumed negotiations yesterday; negotiations have yet to resume on the parkway.

F.Y.I.
Fickle Fees?
Q.
Last week, a friend and I went to the Department of Motor Vehicles to get our learner's permits.
They charged me $37, and my friend $34.50.
They said it had to do with when our birthdays were.
This doesn't seem fair; it doesn't even seem to make sense.
What gives?
A.
Fair it isn't; reasonable it is, at least by bureaucratic standards.
Here's why, as explained by George Filieau, a D.M.V. spokesman.
Until December 1993, prospective drivers had to buy one-year learner's permits.
After passing the road test, a person then had to return to the D.M.V. to buy a license and have an I.D. picture taken.
Two trips, two payments, two adventures in paperwork.
In December 1993, the D.M.V. started a simpler system using computers that could store masses of photos and personal information.
A prospective driver has an I.D. photo taken and pays the license fee when the permit is issued.
Once the road test is passed, a license is automatically issued through the mail.
To spread its workload throughout the year, the D.M.V. generally sets a license's expiration dates based on a driver's birthday at least four years after the application for the learner's permit was filed.
Thus, people who apply this year will get licenses that expire on their birthdays in 1999 or later. (An exception is when a driver's birthday is earlier in the same calendar month than the application date; then, the license expires just shy of four years, on the driver's birthday.)
Because licenses are issued for four years, drivers are assessed $2.50 for each six-month period, or part of a period, beyond that standard duration.
Thus, someone whose birthday is April 10 and who applies on July 10 will have a license that expires in four years and nine months.
But it will cost $5 more than the standard $32 -- $2.50 for each six-month period, or part thereof, beyond four years.
Someone whose birthday is July 10, but who applies on April 10, will have a license good for four years and three months, and will pay $2.50 above the $32 for the extra duration.
If you want to avoid both additional fees and mathematical headaches, apply on your birthday.
O Fleeting Fame Q.  There's an apartment house at 235 Second Avenue, between 14th and 15th Streets, that bears the inscription "U.S. Senate." Was this ever home to the Senate?
A.
No, it was not.
So why are the words there?
To answer a question with a question, did you notice the building next door?
The inscription at 231 Second Avenue says, "W. M. Evarts."
That clears it all up, doesn't it?
Both inscriptions, made in 1903, honor William Maxwell Evarts, a prominent New York lawyer, diplomat and Senator, who died in 1901.
Evarts, according to the Encyclopedia Americana, was involved in several of the more celebrated events of the mid- and late 1800's.
In 1868, he helped President Andrew Johnson survive his impeachment trial in the United States Senate.
In 1871, Evarts got Great Britain to cough up $15.5 million for having helped the Confederate Navy.
The Fate of All Cash Q.  At the north end of the Hudson River Park in Battery Park City there's a bizarre sculpture/chess garden with all these little bronze figures pushing pennies, among other things, into a tower shape in the fountain.
There are some little dead figures buried in the piles of coins, and a bodiless head.
What is it?
A.
It's called "The Real World" and it's definitely not the MTV show.
It's the work of the sculptor Tom Otterness, whose fondness for the little doughboy figures is a trademark.
There are plaques, Mr.
Otterness said, at the northern and southern entrances to the work.
"But nobody ever sees them," he said.
"They just step over them."
The piece was unveiled in 1992 and combines cartoonish whimsy with a comment on the fickleness of the financial businesses that literally shadow the Park.
Mr.
Otterness says he likes to drop by to watch families explore the work.
"I go with my 3-year-old daughter, Kelly," he said.
"It's great to watch. The kids come up and say, 'Look, dead people!' and the parents go 'Eeeeechhhh.' And little kids go up and yell into the ear of the head that's lying down. It seems endless."
Mr.
Otterness's next big public work: designs for the 14th Street subway station on Eighth Avenue, slated for completion in 1999.

Japan Arrests More Suspects In Gas Attack
The police today arrested three members of the Aum Shinrikyo religious sect who had been on a nationwide wanted list in connection with the March poison gas attack on the Tokyo subway system.
The authorities have stepped up their search for fugitive sect members after four incidents in the last week in Tokyo involving poison gas.
There is no indication that the fugitives are responsible, and the sect has denied responsibility, but the episodes reminded the public of Tokyo's vulnerability to terrorist attacks.


Problem Is Rain, Not Reservoirs
New Jersey could use some rain.
Precipitation has been below normal levels every month since last September, making this one of the driest periods in memory, The Associated Press reported.
Despite the drought, the state's reservoirs are only 5 percent below normal -- a circumstance meteorologists attribute to improved management of water supplies and the fact that a wet year preceded the dry spell, with ground water, rivers and reservoirs above normal levels at that time.


Vibrations on Old Pipes Can Shake Out Surprises
When the water pipe that burst yesterday was first built, horses were still common on Manhattan's roads, and the first subway line had not even been completed.
But in the nine decades since, untold subway cars and heavy trucks have rolled by, their vibrations testing the durability of the rigid cast-iron pipe.
And while inspectors frequently test the city's 6,000 miles of water mains to see which are most vulnerable, the age of the pipes leaves the system open to surprises.


Cyberspace-Rights Group Heads West
The Internet backlash is in full swing.
The Senate has passed a bill that restricts free speech on computer networks.
The White House and several foreign governments are restricting the use of private data encryption software.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation wants increased capabilities to conduct telephone and computer network wiretaps.
And in the midst of this, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, one of the first civil liberties groups created to influence public policy on issues related to cyberspace, is closing its Washington office and moving to San Francisco.


From 14th to 42d Streets, Mud and Nothing but Mud
For Transit Authority officials trying to get the flooded Seventh Avenue subway line back in service yesterday, the biggest problem was mud.
The day began with what initially seemed like a bizarre underground rainstorm.
Torrents of water gushing through a jagged crack in a pipe under 40th Street poured onto the tracks in the Times Square subway station and set off in furious streams for Greenwich Village.
When it was over, there was mud and debris everywhere.


2 Dominican Team Members May Be Applying for Asylum
Two members of the Special Olympics team from the Dominican Republic have slipped away from their escorts and may be planning to apply for political asylum to remain in the United States permanently.
David Phelps, a Special Olympics spokesman, said that Juan Carlos Bal Buena, a 20-year-old basketball player from Santo Domingo, was believed to be with relatives in New York today, after apparently receiving help from friends or family to leave the games about 1 P.M.
Friday.
Mr.
Bal Buena, who is described as moderately mentally retarded, was not reported missing until Saturday by members of his delegation.

Pilobolus Is at It Again, In a Duel With Gravity
The Pilobolus Dance Theater will be 25 next year.
In dance-company terms, that is the equivalent of about a century.
But the program presented by Pilobolus on Friday night at the Joyce Theater suggested that these canny cutups of modern dance go right on doing what they do best.
The Pils, as it is familiarly known, can be depended on for stunning physical feats and visual surprises, a peek or two into the crannies of the heart, and lots of humor, both awful and sublime.
"The Doubling Cube," the premiere on this first of three programs, epitomizes the company's physical style.
Choreographed by Robby Barnett, Alison Chase, Michael Tracy, Jonathan Wolken and the performers to a score by Jane Ira Bloom, the new group work takes six bodies, clustered close for the most part, and sends them racing, sprawling and rolling through arcs of movement.


Ex-Rival Accuses Buchanan of 'Flirting' With Fascism
William J. Bennett, former Education Secretary and pugnacious advocate of family values in the Republican Party, has accused Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist and Republican Presidential candidate, of "flirting" with fascism in his vision of America's future.
In a wide-ranging interview in The New Yorker this week, Mr.
Bennett was asked whether he stood by his remark of several years earlier that Mr.
Buchanan had flirted with fascism.


Of Time Travelers And Props
Sali Ann Kriegsman, the new executive director of the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, has been sprinkling her welcoming speech before each performance with warnings about an uninvited guest: a black bear that has been frequenting the grounds (the local police are on alert).
"Wonderland," a new work by Paula Josa-Jones, a choreographer based in Cambridge, Mass., was nonetheless performed without incident on Saturday afternoon at the Studio Theater.
It is doubtful that even an ursine visitor would have looked out of place in the stream of images that make up the phantasmagoria of "Wonderland."


Quest for Sharper TV Likely To Bring More TV Instead
High-definition television, which became the rallying cry for the revival of the American electronics industry in the 1980's, now seems to be a wonder whose time may never come.
Just as the vision of HDTV, with its promise of dazzlingly sharp pictures, is on the verge of becoming reality, broadcasters and regulators increasingly agree that what the American public will want is more television, not better television.


Hospital Urged To Bar Patients Posing a Threat
A Brooklyn grand jury has recommended that criminally insane patients be barred from a state mental hospital in East Flatbush, where a patient escaped and returned with a knife that the police said he used to kill another patient.
The report, released yesterday by the Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes, said the hospital, Kingsboro Psychiatric Center, was never designed to hold the criminally insane.
It said housing dangerous patients at the center, in a residential neighborhood a few blocks away from a high school, posed a serious threat to public safety.


Sydney Journal; Battling Over a National Symbol: It's on the Menu
To many in the loftiest epicurean circles of Sydney, Jean-Paul Bruneteau is a culinary icon, the chef whose popular restaurant, Riberries, has championed the use of overlooked foods from the Australian bush.
But to animal rights groups, Mr.
Bruneteau is the enemy, the man who has tried to turn the Australian national symbol -- the beloved kangaroo -- into food.
And they will do almost anything, they say, to force him to pull it from the menu.


36 Are Injured in Stampede At Concert in Coney Island
About 36 people suffered minor injuries at a reggae concert on Coney Island last night when the sound of gunshots sent audience members fleeing in panic from a fenced park, the police said.
Gunfire erupted in Steeplechase Park around 7:30 P.M. as about 20,000 concertgoers were listening to the daylong festival's final act, Capleton, the police and witnesses said.
There were reports of as many as 40 shots, coming from four different locations in the park.


Haiti: Lessons for the Next Election
Haiti is wise to postpone its next round of elections.
The first round, on June 25, was marred by massive disorganization.
Thousands of eligible voters were unable to cast ballots.
Some were left off lists and some polling places never even opened.
Ballots were handled sloppily and the announcement of results has been postponed.
On July 22 those who missed out in the first round will be able to vote.
The runoffs will now take place in August on a date to be announced.
The postponement should give officials time to learn from their mistakes.
Some of those lessons are startlingly simple.
Ballot boxes need to be sealed, and voters need some education about the process.
In the last round, a largely illiterate electorate was presented with confusing, complicated ballots and given no idea how to handle them.
Many did not even realize that it was not a presidential election.
Giving voters a chance to see a ballot before the voting would help, as well as trying to simplify the ballots themselves.


Christopher Cadbury, 86, a Conservationist
Christopher Cadbury, an Englishman who helped set up and develop nature preserves in Britain and elsewhere, died on June 25 in Worcestershire, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph reported Thursday.
He was 86.

Cadbury worked in his family's chocolate-manufacturing company, Cadbury Brothers, and was president of the Royal Society for Nature Conservation from 1962 to 1988.


A Long Day's Journey Into the Off Season
Here in the National Hockey League's northernmost outpost, the summer sky disorients a visitor's body clock.
The sun doesn't set until after 10 P.M., the dusk lingers long after that and the dawn breaks a few hours later.
This surreal setting was appropriate for the symbolic conclusion of the winter game's longest season.
This was the site of the Entry Draft, Trade Fair and Gossip Flea Market on Saturday at Northlands Coliseum.


Health Care Report Cards
Health care reform received a potential boost earlier this month at a meeting in Wyoming of large private and public employers.
They created a foundation to spur health plans to provide consumers with information that can help determine which plans provide the best treatment.
Participants in the Wyoming meeting vowed to use their collective influence -- together, they employ 80 million workers -- to force health plans to report data that would show which programs provide the most effective care.
Based on the information, the foundation would produce periodic report cards on quality of care, matters like the recovery rates from colon cancer treatment or heart attacks.

The finale of the European Team Championships in Vilamoura, Portugal, nine days ago was one of the most dramatic in the 64-year history of that prestigious event.
There was no doubt that Italy would win, with a young and relatively inexperienced team, and that France would finish second, with a nucleus of stars who took the World Olympiad Team title in Salsomaggiore, Italy, three years ago.
The excitement concerned third and fourth place, which would earn qualification for the world championships scheduled for Beijing in October.
With eight deals remaining, Poland, Sweden and the Netherlands were virtually tied for third.
Poland was playing Sweden and needed simply to play steadily.
But the Poles indulged in a series of slight overbids and lost the match heavily.
As a result, their players, who have had great success in international competition, will not be in Beijing, but the Swedes and the Dutch will.


U.N. Warns Serbs Of Bombing if They Attack Dutch Unit
United Nations officials said tonight that NATO air strikes had been authorized if Bosnian Serbs attacked a United Nations position in eastern Bosnia.
The threat of bombing and the detention of 30 peacekeepers by the Serbs raised the prospect of a new cycle of violence and reprisal that could further damage the already fragile United Nations mission.


Investigation Of Company Stirs Curiosity
The last time the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company tangled with antitrust enforcers, there was no mystery about what landed the grain trading and processing giant in the Federal Government's gunsights.
A.D.M. wanted to acquire a competitor's capacity to make corn sweetener, and the Government said the deal would reduce competition.
That battle began in 1982 and ended with an A.D.M. victory in court in 1991.
The outcome has only added to the intrigue surrounding A.D.M.'s announcement on June 28 that it was the subject of a new investigation of price-fixing in the global markets for sweeteners and other food and feed additives.


Mets End the First Half on a Familiar Note: Falling Flat
The Mets ended the first half of the season exactly as they started it: with a two-game losing streak.
And that does not say anything about all those defeats in between.
Somebody named Esteban Loaiza tossed a five-hitter against the hapless New Yorkers at Three Rivers Stadium this afternoon to give the Pittsburgh staff its first back-to-back complete games in nearly three years.
The Mets, meanwhile, fumbled their way to 3 more errors to give them 10 in their last 4 games.
Bret Saberhagen, trade rumors swirling all about him, departed once again with arm fatigue.
And, after the Mets scored two quick runs in the second inning, their bats once again fell silent en route to a 6-3 loss -- their league-worst 44th of the year.


New Look for Train Station
The Central Railroad of New Jersey station in Elizabeth will undergo a facelift as one of about 100 transportation projects that are to receive a total of $20.5 million in Federal and state funds, Gov.

About $7.6 million will go to municipalities for roadwork.
The remainder has been earmarked for bikeways, roadway walking paths and rest areas.


In America; Health &amp; Safety Wars
On one side you have extremely powerful politicians, like the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, and Representative David McIntosh, a champion of industry who once headed Dan Quayle's Council on Competitiveness.

Infant Mortality Rate Drops But Racial Disparity Grows
Infant mortality in the United States declined to a record low last year, but the gap between rates for blacks and whites is growing and is not expected to narrow in the next 15 years, the Government said today.
Preliminary data, disclosed by the National Center for Health Statistics, show that there were 7.9 infant deaths for every 1,000 live births in the United States in 1994, while the figure for 1993 was 8.3 and 8.5 for 1992.
The rate first fell below 12 per 1,000 in 1981.

Outrage Keeps Shifting In Republican Primaries
AS Patrick J. Buchanan sees it, New York is the most reactionary state in the union.
And he has a point.
The conservative commentator came to town the other day to complain about New York's infamously restrictive election laws.
He stood there at a news conference in the Doral Inn and said the Presidential primary race "comes very close to being a political fix." He called the system a match for Eastern Europe, "circa 1955." He said that fair is fair and New York isn't.
And who could argue with him?

Foster Jr., the former deputy White House counsel who committed suicide in 1993, in an effort to buttress its case that there was no link between his death and the controversy over the failed Arkansas land deal.
Breaking months of silence imposed by the special Whitewater prosecutor, Kenneth W. Starr, White House lawyers summoned reporters to review pager records, security logs and Secret Service reports on the handling of access to Mr.
Foster's office and papers in the hours and days after his death on July 20, 1993.

Rupture of Pipe Floods Subway in Manhattan
A huge turn-of-the-century water main ruptured just south of Times Square shortly before dawn yesterday.
A geyser of floodwaters that surged unchecked for six hours turned Seventh Avenue into a small lake and two subway lines into rivers that ran chest-deep and fast to Greenwich Village, two miles away.
No one was injured, and damage was limited to the broken main, a cratered street and flooded basements around the site at 40th Street and Seventh Avenue.
But the spectacular break halted all Seventh and Eighth Avenue subway service, created huge traffic snarls in midtown Manhattan and left the city with an enormous cleanup job in mud-caked, debris-strewn subway stations and tunnels.


The French Discover One of Their Own, Sculptor and Feminist
Louise Bourgeois was over 70 when a one-woman show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1982 first earned the artist broad recognition in her adopted land.
Now, at the age of 83, the feisty and voluble feminist is finally being discovered by her native France through a major retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art of the City of Paris.
In a sense, the wait was worthwhile; many admirers of her work believe the last decade has been her most creative period.
The Paris show, which is to run until Oct. 8, has therefore been organized in reverse chronological order to emphasize her recent work, with half of the 50 sculptures and installations on display here dated after 1982.


Sports of The Times; Becker Won't Take Glory From Sampras
BORIS BECKER wasn't fooled.
He knew the crowd had granted him an extraordinary romp around Center Court because he is an old guy, 27, who had just been sizzled by Pete Sampras, all of four years younger.
The crowd has loved Becker since the first day he stuck out his burly chest and took over Center Court a whole decade ago.
And after Sampras had paraded around the court in the proper, ceremonial display of the winner's trophy, the crowd called for Becker.
Sampras urged him to take the lap, and Becker jogged around the court with what little spring was left in his legs.

TV News Crossing Old Lines On Jobs
It was Friday night, the start of the Fourth of July holiday weekend, when Jerry Nachman, vice president of news at WCBS-TV (Channel 2) in New York, got a phone call at home telling him three things: that Elizabeth Holtzman, the former New York City Comptroller, had been mugged at an automatic teller machine in Manhattan, that two city firefighters had helped to catch the culprit and that Channel 2 had no reporter available to cover the story.
Mr.
Nachman, a newsman for 25 years, dashed downstairs to a news van at his front door, got to the scene, interviewed Ms.
Holzman and the firefighters, and reported it all live on the 11 o'clock Channel 2 news.


They Let Their Fingers Do the Talking
Little more than a year ago, Michael Bolanos, an independent concert producer, decided to get into the computer on-line business in a modest way.
On Compuserve, a major on-line service whose subscribers can dial in for access to everything from out-of-town newspapers to stock quotations to conversation, he started an entertainment forum.
It would be a little alcove in cyberspace, where, he figured, people could meet to discuss movies and television shows.
Mr.
Bolanos began his venture with a friend, one personal computer, scant hope of riches and no intention of abandoning his work as a producer.


Saving Farmland By Saving Farmers
It's just a field: 57 acres of bottom land along the Shepaug River, below Mine Hill, where for as long as many people remember, dairy farmers have grown corn for their cows.
But fields are more than just fields in the soft hills and valleys of Litchfield County.
Carved out of wilderness by farmers, they both define the pastoral landscape that attracts artists, writers and, increasingly, summer people, and hold it open for view.

Flood-Control Plan Takes Shape
Federal and local officials have unveiled a $42.3 million plan to control flooding in South River and Sayreville.
A flood wall and two levees would be built along parts of the South River and the adjoining Washington Canal.
Six major floods have hit South River and Sayreville since 1962, including one that forced the evacuation of 200 people.
The plan also calls for studying flooding in Old Bridge and restoring 250 acres of wetlands damaged by dredging in the Washington Canal.

The Perks of a Music Man (Annotated)
It wasn't close to the estimated $360 million that Michael Ovitz was seeking to become the head of MCA.
But Doug Morris was on his way to a pretty good year before Time Warner dismissed him last month as chief of its Warner Music domestic record labels.
The ensuing contract dispute provides a rare public glimpse into the fine print of perquisites for a music mogul.
When Time Warner dismissed Mr.
Morris, he lost more than a job, salary and stock options; he's out a car and driver, use of the corporate jet and a family room full of consumer electronics.


Health Law May Go Nationwide

This is happening at a time when, many doctors say, the field is more unwelcoming than ever.
They sputter about pressures to join health maintenance organizations, about Government red tape and the cost of malpractice insurance, about daily negotiations with insurance administrators who refuse to authorize tests on patients they will never meet.


Sampras Defends Wimbledon Title


Media; TELEVISION: Smelling blood, Fox is taking quick aim at NBC's beleaguered 'Saturday Night Live.'
NBC's "Saturday Night Live" has been written off as dead numerous times in its 20-year run, but only this year has the speculation been taken seriously enough for its competitors to consider trying to rub out the show permanently.
While ABC and CBS have both been developing late-night shows for Saturdays, Fox has already announced its plans: starting in October the network will offer its own Saturday night sketch-comedy show, "Mad TV."


The Game Needs a Save, So Nomo Must Get a Start
Major league baseball has dedicated a half a season's worth of effort to fans who are no longer there, the missing in action who have chosen to show their displeasure with the game and its endless wrangles over money and power by tuning out.
But tomorrow night, baseball will be shifting its attention to those who want to tune in.
It will do so by giving the public what potentially is the best show to hit baseball in a long time: Hideo Nomo versus the American League at the annual All-Star Game, which this year will be held in Arlington, Tex.

Ex-Tenant Questioned in Fire

On Stage 8, the Yellow Jersey Is Reclaimed by Its Owner
Big Mig won, of course, but this time it wasn't easy.
Storming to the finish line, standing in the saddle, the sweat dripping from his face and the veins in his arms bulging as he pushed down on his bicycle's handlebars, Miguel Indurain barely triumphed in the Tour de France's first big test today.
For the fifth successive year, Indurain, a Spaniard who rides for the Banesto team, won the Tour's first long individual time trial.
He also donned the overall leader's yellow jersey.


The Pentagon Jackpot
Pentagon officials can hardly believe their good fortune.
While furiously cutting domestic programs to balance the Federal budget, Congress is showering the Defense Department with billions the generals did not request.
It is a disheartening exhibition of political self-interest, devoid of any plausible national-security justification.
The sole purpose is to dispense defense dollars and jobs to as many Congressional districts as possible.
There should be no place for lavish military spending when threats to the United States are diminishing and disadvantaged Americans are facing drastic cuts in Government programs that help them sustain the barest standard of living.
Led by Republicans who suggest that American defenses are inadequate, the House and Senate seem to be engaged in a race to see which can throw more money at the Pentagon.
The Senate Armed Services Committee recently approved a $264.7 billion military budget for 1996, about $7 billion more than the Pentagon requested.
The House has approved a $267.3 billion plan.
Either way, Congress is prematurely braking the decline in the defense budget that appropriately began with the end of the cold war and disintegration of the Soviet Union.
The Congressional budget numbers go even higher in the years ahead.


An Aspiring Sailor Learns the Ropes


Judge Johnson's Medal
When President Clinton gives a Presidential Medal of Freedom to Judge Frank Johnson later this year, he will be reminding the nation how this quiet man improved American justice and the life of his native Alabama.
In 40 years on the Federal bench, Judge Johnson has seen his assignment as upholding the Constitution, fairly interpreting the law and doing equal justice to poor and rich.
For doing that, violence-prone segregationists threatened his safety and that of his family.
For desegregating Alabama's schools and colleges, he won the denunciation of Gov.
George Wallace.
For demanding decent conditions in state prisons, he won criticism for judicial activism.
His brave rulings cleared the way for the Selma march and sent killers to jail on Federal civil rights charges when the state courts failed to act forcefully to end racial violence.
It was truly said that while Mr.
Wallace ranted and railed, Judge Johnson ran the state.
Indeed, his governance was as orderly and principled as Mr.
Wallace's was fitful and biased.


U.N. Report Accuses Croatian Troops of Killing Refugees
A United Nations report quoting testimony by witnesses asserts that Croatian Army troops machine-gunned refugees and committed other "serious" human rights violations in their attack two months ago on part of Croatia held by Serbian rebels.
The report, which is expected to be made public this week, challenges the Croatian Government's contention that from 20 to 54 civilians died in the fighting.
It says information gathered from "various international sources credibly indicate a number of civilian dead in excess of the Government's figures." The report says there should be further investigation.


Police Managed the News in Second Siege of Squatter Street
To the Editor:
I was among the astonished observers of the police preparations for the confrontation with the squatters who had returned to the building on East 13th Street the night of July 4 (news article, July 5).
While the magnitude of the response seemed both ludicrous and ominous, I was equally disturbed by the lack of press presence at the moment of actual confrontation, as this seemed to me the best hope for a minimum of police violence.
The potential for excess seemed enormous.
The press did arrive (I identified Channel 7 Eyewitness News and WINS radio).
But the reporters were not allowed within the police cordon.
I was amazed to see how readily they accepted being restricted.
Am I old-fashioned?
I grew up in a time when reporters routinely made their way to the front lines in war zones.
Now I saw them meekly standing on the sidelines in peacetime in their own city, accepting whatever scraps of information were available from the police and the rest of the people who were barricaded out.
Isn't this kind of censorship newsworthy?
Although WNYC's local newscaster mentioned next morning that reporters were kept a block and a half away from the besieged building, this was far from universally reported.

To the Editor:

AUTO RACING Jeff Gordon Gets Fifth Victory of Season
Jeff Gordon used pit-stop strategy to join the leaders, then drove a smooth line to the top of the Winston Cup standing with an easy victory yesterday in the Slick 50 300 at New Hampshire International Speedway in Loudon.
Giving the new Chevrolet Monte Carlos their 13th victory in 16 Winston Cup events this year, Gordon collected $160,300 from a $1.3 million purse.
Included in his earnings was a $50,000 bonus for taking the lead in the series points race.
Gordon passed the seven-time champion Dale Earnhardt on the 170th of 300 laps on the 1.058-mile oval, then surrendered the lead only during caution periods.
The victory was his series-leading fifth this season. (AP) VILLENEUVE WINS: Jacques Villeneuve went virtually unchallenged en route to his second straight Texaco-Havoline 200 victory at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wis. (AP) GOLF Mayfair Takes the Western Open

Mayfair's second career victory in six seasons earned him the $360,000 top prize in the $2 million event, one of the richest on the PGA Tour.
The check more than doubled his season winnings to $630,985.

Free Health Plan and Anger Divide Whitman and Unions
Talks for a new contract with state workers begin a week's recess on Monday with Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman's administration and its biggest union separated as much by anger as by differences on wages and benefits.
The administration settled last week with two small unions, but negotiations with the Communications Workers of America, which represents 38,000 of 65,000 workers in state government service, have foundered on the Governor's demands that workers in traditional health plans begin to contribute part of the cost.

In just a few years it becomes a fount of cash, with artists as diverse as Luciano Pavarotti and Sheryl Crow.

A chart yesterday comparing figures of reported felonies for New York City with figures for the 44th Precinct in the Bronx reversed the two sets of statistics.

In Regulatory Overhaul Debate, Every Word Counts
For the next several days, senators will be arguing over the minutiae of an ambitious attempt to change how regulations affecting areas as diverse as toxic waste dumps and job safety are written.
Almost everybody in the Senate agrees on the need for legislation to give businesses relief from costly Federal regulations on health, safety and the environment.


Left Dangling, Cellular Style, On the New Jersey Turnpike
In the old days, if a flood of phone calls overwhelmed the system and calls did not go through, frustrated customers could only sit at home or in the office and fume.
But this is the age of cellular technology, and they have a more advanced option: They can sit in their cars and fume.
The number of cellular receiver sites is growing fast, nearly 50 percent last year, but in some areas the number of phones is growing even faster than the structure that enables the calls to go through.
Like the charming little restaurant that has been discovered, rendering it neither charming nor little, the system is losing its ability to cope.


The Third Time Is Charming: Sampras Wins at Wimbledon Again

He was unusually motivated: Sampras dearly wanted to use this championship as a get-well gift for his ailing coach, Tim Gullikson, who is back home in Chicago undergoing chemotherapy in an attempt to battle brain cancer.

To China, Wu Hongda, as he was named at birth in Shanghai 58 years ago, is nothing but a convicted criminal and spy, an unrepentant counterrevolutionary who spent 19 years in labor camps and has taken revenge by secretly entering China under false names to steal state secrets.


After Assurances on California Jobs, Clinton Is Expected to Approve Base-Closing List
After agonizing for more than a week, President Clinton is expected to approve the recommendations of an independent commission on military bases, now that the Pentagon has been assured that it has the authority to keep thousands of jobs at a California Air Force base, Administration officials said today.
Mr.
Clinton had been considering rejecting the commission's recommendation to close McClellan Air Force Base near Sacramento because the loss of the installation's 11,000 military and civilian jobs would hurt the economy of a large state crucial to his 1996 campaign hopes.


New Owner of MCA Is Said Close to Hiring Two Key Executives
Two top entertainment figures are to join MCA Inc., as Edgar Bronfman Jr. begins to make his mark on the big studio and music company, industry executives said tonight.
In a major surprise, Ron Meyer, the president of Hollywood's top talent agency, Creative Artists Agency, is to oversee MCA's film and television business, the executives said.
Mr.
Meyer is a longtime ally of Michael Ovitz, the chairman of Creative Artists, who himself was nearly lured to MCA several weeks ago.
And Doug Morris, who ran Warner Music's record labels until he was dismissed by Time Warner management last month, will go to MCA to start his own record label, according to people familiar with those talks.

SELLOUT Aldrich Ames and the Corruption of the C.I.A.
By James Adams  Illustrated. 322 pages.
Viking. $23.95.
There's no question that Aldrich Ames, whose spying for the Soviet Union cost the lives of some 10 American agents and thereby obliterated the C.I.A.'s human penetration of the Russian system, was very bad for the United States.
But Mr.
Ames was, as reporters often put it, a good story.
He was a real-life John le Carre character involved in a cold-war tale of espionage, treason and bureaucratic failure.
This no doubt explains why Mr.
Ames's eight-year career as a highly placed mole and his capture by the Federal Bureau of Investigation has produced a large crop of books.
The three under review here all tell the story briskly and well.
Indeed, there is not a great deal of reason to choose one over the others.
Peter Maas adheres most closely to the standard formula in the telling of such stories, squeezing drama from the material, ending chapters on page-turning notes of portent ("Ames's squinty eyes, angular face, and pointy nose made him look just like a mole"), dwelling on the details and the excitement involved in the F.B.I.'s actual capture of the spy.
The accounts by David Wise and James Adam are richer in background information -- Mr.
Wise is especially sophisticated as he discusses the inner workings of the spy trade -- and they provide fuller pictures of the agents working for our side whose lives were destroyed by Mr.
Ames's perfidy.
Mr.
Adams is the only one who attempts to draw some deeper meaning from the Ames affair, arguing that "his cumulative acts of treachery have so undermined the American intelligence community that it will be changed forever by his acts," but he does not delve deeply into this theme.
Instead, Mr.
Adams, like the other chroniclers, sticks mostly to the story of espionage and betrayal.
Mr.
Ames was 44 when he began his career as a traitor.
In his 23-year career at the C.I.A. he had been posted in Mexico City and Rome and, in 1985, was at the agency's headquarters in Virginia as chief of the Soviet counterintelligence branch.
"He knew it all," Mr.
Wise reports.
And he told it all, starting with the day he walked into the Soviet Embassy in Washington and handed over a letter addressed to the K.G.B. station chief offering to sell classified information for $50,000.
The Soviets knew a good thing when they saw it.
They readily accepted Mr.
Ames's offer and made clear to him that if he kept the information coming, there would be a lot more than $50,000 for him.
There were millions more before Mr.
Ames was finally unmasked in 1993.
Given that the West did win the cold war, it is clear that his information was not decisive in the larger struggle.
But very early on in his relationship with the K.G.B., Mr.
Ames loaded up a plastic bag with secret documents that gave away the identities of several Russians who were agents for the United States, including two who were working right there in the Soviet Embassy in Washington.
They and a number of others were tortured and executed as a result of the information Mr.
Ames provided.
Among them was Gen.
Dimitri Fedorovich Polyakov, considered by many the most valuable spy in the C.I.A.'s history until, as Mr.
Wise writes, "Aldrich Ames turned him in."
All three writers try to deal with the biggest question left behind by the Ames scandal: How did he get away with it for so long?
In retrospect, at least, it is clear that Mr.
Ames should never have been trusted with high responsibility in the first place.
He was a drunk.
His lie-detector tests were inconclusive at best.
While he fed the Soviets information right out of the C.I.A.'s computers, he and his wife lived conspicuously beyond their means.
The C.I.A. knew that its Soviet agents were being given away, yet Mr.
Ames remained in place for eight years.
These books explain the problem in part with references to the "culture" of the C.I.A., which discourages the idea that there can be traitors in its midst.
There was also the heritage of James Angleton, the former counterintelligence chief whose fanatical search for moles in the 1960's left the agency so demoralized that it overreacted by never wanting to search for moles again.
And there is what might be called the fog of espionage, or, as Mr.
Angleton himself put it, "the wilderness of mirrors." There are too many actors involved to easily locate suspects, and it is difficult to know if a particular compromise was caused by a mole or by some technical feat of the other side.
Why did Mr.
Ames do it?
Mr.
Maas stresses the money and Mr.
Ames's need to indulge his greedy and demanding wife, Rosario, who became a co-conspirator in the last couple of years.
Mr.
Maas's citations from wiretapped conversations make for the most unflattering portrait of Mrs.
Ames.
Mr.
Adams, by contrast, the only one of the three authors to have interviewed her, seems at times to be taken in by her self-serving versions of events.
In any case, surely there were other C.I.A. employees who needed money and did not become traitors.
To try to explain why Mr.
Ames did, the authors mention other ingredients: his low self-esteem, his evolving politics, which put him in many ways closer to the Russians than to the Americans, the thrill of outsmarting the system that employed him.
In the end, the answer remains elusive.
Unlike Mrs.
Ames, who is serving a six-year prison sentence in a state of denial and depression, Mr.
Ames, according to these writers, seems content despite his life sentence.
He was besieged with interview requests.
Connie Chung actually embraced him.
He was interviewed on CNN and quoted in newspapers around the globe.
He has become famous, a legend.
Meanwhile, as all of the writers note, he has never expressed a word of regret for the men he destroyed.


Exaggeration's the Thing, via Wodehouse
"The Play's the Thing," P. G. Wodehouse's 1926 English adaptation of Ferenc Molnar's Hungarian comedy "The Play at the Castle," retains the potential to enchant.
Yet it's not until late in the evening that any hint of enchantment surfaces in the Roundabout Theater's commonplace revival, which opened last night at the Criterion Center.
This "Play's the Thing" is not a disaster to equal the misguided Roundabout staging of "Hedda Gabler" just a year ago.
It looks handsome.
It has a cast of good actors, all of whom have performed with merit in other works.
What's missing is any sense of the securely sophisticated style that defines high comedy.
Most of the time the production is like something put on by college students, not all of whom appear to be the right age for the roles they're playing, even when they are.
It was only my imagination working overtime with boredom, but I thought I could detect the scent of talcum powder in the air.


A Tracker Of the Stars Has Stoops To Conquer
Larry Wolfe Horwitz sidled up to the liveried doorman at the Kenilworth apartment house, one of the towering prewar fortresses that line Central Park West.
Word was out that the movie star Michael Douglas was about to get a divorce, and Mr.
Horwitz was in pursuit.
"How you doing?" he asked the doorman.


Glennon Awarded Popeye's Account
The Popeye's Chicken and Biscuits division of America's Favorite Chicken Company in Atlanta named the Glennon Companies in St.
Louis to handle its national account, with billings estimated at $7 million.
The account had been at Fitzgerald &amp; Company in Atlanta for two years until the company and that agency parted ways in April.
Glennon was awarded the account last week after a three-month review narrowed the field to four finalists: Glennon; Garfield, Linn &amp; Company in Chicago, which had handled the account before Fitzgerald; Gray Kirk/VanSant in Baltimore, and Henderson Advertising in Greenville, S.C.


Broderbund Strong In Software Sales
The latest listings of best-selling software show that when it's no longer tax time, titles that allow businesses to create page designs for everything from brochures to news releases remain the chief rival to personal-finance software.
For both Macintosh computers and P.C.'s Broderbund's Print Shop Deluxe CD Ensemble is one of the top three best sellers.


Two public service campaigns rely on 'the wow factor.'
THE public service announcement ranks among the most treacherous art forms in advertising.
It invites failure: the advertisement needs to be earnest enough for television stations to donate broadcast time, but astringent enough for viewers to remember.
Two public service organizations, the American Red Cross and the United Nations, have developed different campaigns that rely on a similar approach, what a United Nations official calls "the wow factor."


His Master's Choice


Dr. Bernard F. Riess, 87, Who Lost Teaching Post in McCarthy Era
Dr.
Bernard F. Riess, a prominent psychologist whose dismissal from the Hunter College faculty in 1952 for refusal to answer Senate questions in the heyday of McCarthyism was redressed by New York City 30 years later, died July 3 at his home in New Preston, Conn.
He was 87.
In a career that spanned more than 60 years, Dr.
Riess was a university teacher, a therapist with private and community-clinic practices, the director of mental health centers, an industrial consultant, the author and editor of scores of articles and books, and a lifelong advocate of progressive causes.


Haiti to Delay Announcement Of Results of National Voting
Haiti announced today that it would delay until Tuesday releasing the results of the first national elections since President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was restored to power, and tensions grew over how the losers might respond to the announcement.
The nine-member Provisional Electoral Council initially had said it would release on Saturday the results from the June 25 elections for parliamentary and local offices.


Stolen Cars Find a World Of Welcome
The glittering green Toyota 4-Runner sat in a lot at a port terminal here, surrounded by a sea of cars waiting to be shipped overseas.
But something looked wrong.
The trunk lock was sealed crudely with a jagged piece of metal and four screws, suggesting a break-in.
Jose Valentin, a Newark police detective, and his partner, Douglass Farrell, a United States Customs Service agent, sniffed around the car for more clues, prying open its hood, crouching to look up at its belly, pointing to spots where identification stickers had been peeled off.


Coastal Property
It is probably not an exaggeration to say that the thought of a powerful hurricane hitting the region keeps insurance industry executives up nights.
A major hurricane hitting land on Long Island or in New York City could cause estimated insured losses in excess of $40 billion, according to a study of coastal property and populations by the Insurance Research Council, and industry group.
The value of insured property in the area's coastal counties has soared recently, almost doubling in New York from 1988 to 1993, and increasing by more than 70 percent in New Jersey and Connecticut, Long Island (inclucding Brooklyn and Queens) alone accounts for almost 20 percent of the value of Atlantic and Gulf coastal property.


County Fairs in Full Swing
Corn dogs and cotton candy, Ferris wheels and 4-H exhibits, horse shows and horticulture exhibits -- those are the hallmarks of agricultural fairs, and this is the month that the fair season swings into high gear.


Space Program Still Makes Hearts Beat Faster; We Can't Afford It
To the Editor:
As to Frank Rich's July 5 column, "The Lost Frontier," on the lunacy of America's interest in the movie "Apollo 13" and society's indifference to the joint Russian-American space linkup: Why would he believe it would be anything different?


American Tricks Captors in Kashmir and Bolts to Freedom
An American kidnapped by rebels in India made a daring escape this weekend, tricking his captors by feigning illness and then bolting to freedom in the isolated foothills of the Himalayas.
Faking stomach cramps and diarrhea pains, the American, John Childs, of Simsbury, Conn., played on sympathy to escape Saturday from Muslim guerrillas who have kidnapped at least five Westerners in their fight to end Indian control of Kashmir.
The others are still being held, officials said.


Patents; Really Saying It With Flowers
Thomas Edison first recorded the human voice in 1877.
But two new patents have been issued for inventions that commit our voices to posterity in ways he might never have imagined.
Geoffrey Stern, a marketing specialist in Manhattan, has developed a way to send a voice message along with a bouquet of flowers.
The sender calls a toll-free telephone number to leave a recorded message, which is then downloaded by the florist into a card containing a voice chip and delivered with the flowers.


Wife Urging Tough Response to Dissident's Arrest
Ching Lee Wu, the wife of Harry Wu, says she has hardly slept during the last three weeks as she has tried to mobilize support and publicity for her husband in the press and at various levels of government.
Today at their home here, 40 miles south of San Francisco, the telephone rang continually with calls from supporters, and on Monday she is heading to Washington to lobby on her husband's behalf.


One More Title for Navratilova
Martina Navratilova, even in semi- retirement, added another Grand Slam title to her collection today at Wimbledon when she and partner Jonathan Stark, seeded third, defeated fourth-seeded Gigi Fernandez and Cyril Suk in the mixed-doubles final.
Her 19th Wimbledon title -- including a record nine singles crowns -- brought her overall Grand Slam total to 56: 18 singles, 31 doubles and 7 mixed doubles.


World Games Close With a Flourish
The Special Olympics World Games ended today, and almost everyone concerned was happy with the achievements -- athletic and otherwise -- over the last nine days.
For the 7,200 athletes from 140 nations, all mentally retarded and some physically disabled, there was almost endless competition in 19 sports.
They made new friends from far-off nations.
And they proved to themselves and to the public that mental retardation is not the end of a productive life, but just one more obstacle to be dealt with.


Jewish Law Rejects Assisted Suicide
To the Editor:
It is with profound compassion that I read of the plight of Myrna Lebov, a New York City patient with multiple sclerosis, whose husband, George Delury, admitted to assisting in her suicide at her request (front page, July 6).
However wrenching this story is, I must take exception to the impression, accurately or inaccurately formed, that the couple took away after talking with their rabbi about suicide for the terminally ill: "If it happens, it would be as natural a death as any other."


Oklahoma Witness Sees a 'Witch Hunt'
James Rosencrans says he has always been suspicious of Federal agents.
Now, he says, he is downright fearful of them.
The latest witness to appear before the grand jury in the Oklahoma bombing investigation, Mr.
Rosencrans has returned to his home here with nothing but complaints about the experience.
He says the agents he went to Oklahoma to help are on "a witch hunt" and are bent on crucifying him.


ARAFAT'S FORCES PUSH CRACKDOWN ON GAZA RADICALS
Yasir Arafat's security apparatus has gone on the offensive against Muslim militants in the Gaza Strip, arresting scores of radicals and consolidating its authority in this crowded coastal region.
The size of the Palestinian security force has increased steadily in the year since Mr.
Arafat returned from decades in exile.
It now numbers about 20,000, including policemen and soldiers.


Patents; New sunglasses stop jet-lag sufferers from resetting their body clocks too many times.
DESPITE promising new lines of treatment, globe-trotters still have no easy and sure-fire relief from jet lag.
Now Murray N. Waldman, an inventor in Winnipeg, Manitoba, has received a United States patent for something that he says could fight the disorientation that arises after crossing multiple time zones.


Hiroshima Exhibit Opens Quietly at a University
The exhibition hall was not in one of the cavernous museums that dot this city's landscape.
Rather, the artifacts were displayed in a small room on the sixth-floor of a student center.
It is a small but powerful collection, energized by faces and personal belongings.
It is an exhibit on the destruction caused by the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and it opened on Saturday at American University, not very far from the Smithsonian Institution, where an exhibition on the same subject had been scaled back under pressure from veterans' groups.


Mattingly First Half Already Forgotten
Don Mattingly wants to purge the first 66 games of this strange season from his memory.
Erase the statistics and start fresh.
Obviously, Mattingly cannot officially do that, but he will do it in his mind.
The first half is history.
He struggled, the Yankees struggled and Mattingly wants to forget.
Everything.
There is much for him to forget.
Mattingly has managed one home run.
His golden glove has made five errors, as many miscues as he had in the last two years.
He was plagued by a viral infection in his right eye that blurred his vision for five weeks, stunted his batting average and made him much more susceptible to the harsh criticism he has skirted for 12 seasons in New York.


Don K. Price, 85, Educator And Science Promoter, Dies
Don K. Price Jr., an educator who devoted much of his career to promoting the role of science in the American Government, died today in the Newton-Wellesley Alzheimer Center in Wellesley, Mass.
He was 85 years old and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for several years.
He was a longtime resident of Cambridge, Mass.
The cause of death was Alzheimer's disease, according to his wife, Harriet.


Tools of Brain Surgery
To the Editor:
We were pleased to read the article explaining the value of stereotactic radiosurgery for treatment of a variety of tumors and other abnormalities in the brain (Health page, July 5).
However, the article gives the impression that radiosurgery, which uses highly focused radiation beams, can only be performed using the Leksell Gamma Knife.


Yanks Botch Chances And Give Game Away
The Yankees walked off the field muttering about their ragged play.
They removed their grimy uniforms and disappeared to different parts of the country for a brief and necessary break.
They did not want to play baseball or even see a baseball.
Not after today's fiasco.
They were embarrassed.
Steve Howe continued muttering after the depressing loss.
On an oppressively hot afternoon when the Rangers made six errors and tried to give the Yankees a neat going-away present, they responded by giving it right back in succumbing, 5-4, in 12 long innings.
Mickey Tettleton lashed a one-out single to left field off Howe that scored Mark McLemore from second base and gave the Yankees much to ponder as the unofficial first half of the season ended in a symbolically sloppy manner.


Martin Bucksbaum, 74, Pioneer In Shopping Center Development
Martin Bucksbaum, a pioneer in the development of shopping centers and real estate investment trusts, died on Friday at his home in Des Moines.
He was 74 years old.
The cause was a heart attack, his family said.


Matching Funds Hold Key to Welfare Reform
To the Editor:
Re "Drive for Block Grants Pitting State Against State" (front page, June 28): Under the Senate welfare bill, grants are paid to states without regard for what a state pays.
States are fighting over the formula because it is free money, with no obligation.


CHRONICLE
Rarely do print journalists see their names emblazoned on anything but a newspaper, a magazine, perhaps a book.
WINSOR BROWN FRENCH 2D, a bon vivant and society columnist in Cleveland from 1931 to 1968, mostly for The Cleveland Press, would no doubt be pleased to see where his name is imprinted: on a restaurant.
Winsor's, the restaurant named for Mr.
French, who died in 1982, is in the new $27.6 million Wyndham Cleveland Play House Square Hotel on Euclid Avenue, which opened Saturday with considerable fanfare.


CHRONICLE
People in the audience wore T-shirts with his picture on them.
Women screamed when he ascended to the stage.
Men shouted to him.
Rock star?
Actor?
Athlete?
No, orchestra conductor.
KEITH LOCKHART'S debut conducting the Boston Pops's famous Fourth of July concert last week was a measure of his pop celebrity.
He is one of a number of young, personable, media-savvy conductors drawing lots of attention to themselves and enthusiastic new audiences to their orchestras across the nation.


An Ode to the Typewriter
If the business world is a jungle, then the rise and fall of the typewriter is one of its more cherishable demonstrations of evolution, of the little creature that could, for a while at least.
As the Smith Corona Corporation filed for bankruptcy protection last week, one of the final signals in the triumph of personal computers and software over the typewriter was at hand.
So, too, was a sheaf of lessons in human adaptability.
Pursued by eccentrics and visionaries for more than a century before the first practical model was patented in 1868, the typewriter revolutionized world industry.
It became the critical element in opening the doors of Western industry to women.
Even now at the Katherine Gibbs secretarial schools across the nation, digital stamina requires that speed-typing classes begin on a typewriter -- an electric -- before proceeding to the latest keyboard innovations of glyphic mice and men.


Kodak Sees a Future Where Film Is Optional
When the flags in Oklahoma City were raised on July 4 to their full height for the first time since the bombing of the Federal building in April, David Longstreet, a photographer for The Associated Press, was there to record the event.
Like the images he took of the building soon after the bombing, these pictures were not captured on film but on a silicon chip and, minutes after they were taken, they were sent over telephone lines to AP subscribers around the world.
Filmless electronic cameras offer photographers like Mr.
Longstreet unprecedented convenience and speed.
Instead of having to leave the scene of action to get their film to a darkroom, they can call up their images on a computer screen and straightaway transmit them for publication.
The AP has bought 50 or so of these cameras for its photographers.


Technology; DIGITAL COMMERCE: Virtual-world users put themselves in a sort of electronic puppet show.
FOR more than a decade, those involved in the world of high-powered computers have helped build tools for creating computer-generated three-dimensional environments, which have become known over the years as virtual reality.
And because more of that computer power is finding its way into today's personal computers, interest in bringing this 3D technology into the home is giving rise to a new genre of consumer software called "virtual worlds."
A virtual world is not the same as what is known as virtual reality because it employs only a personal computer and a mouse to display and navigate 3D scenes.
It does not require data gloves and head-mounted displays for viewing, thus avoiding both the cost (and the vertigo) that such equipment often produces.


Taking In the Sites; Play Ball! Find Out Fast Who's on First
Attendance at most ball parks may be lagging, but baseball is still enjoying a golden age on the World Wide Web.
The latest baseball Web site is a throwback to the days when Western Union relayed play-by-play descriptions over the telegraph and fans gathered around ticker-tape machines during the World Series.
This week, Instant Sports Inc. of Austin, Tex., begins play-by-play coverage of every major league game -- every play of every game, updated every minute.
For Mets fans, it can be like watching the Lusitania sink, one porthole at a time.


Being of Two Cultures and Belonging to Neither; After an Acclaimed Novel, a Korean-American Writer Searches for His Roots
In kindergarten, Chang-rae Lee did not say a word.
Day after day he sat in class in New Rochelle, sponging up the English spoken by his teacher and classmates and wringing it out in Korean in his mind.


Cutting Down on Amenities To Achieve No-Frills Jails
The national anticrime mood that has led to mandatory sentences and wider use of the death penalty has also brought a crackdown on the amenities and free services criminals receive in prison.
The movement is driven partly by a need to control corrections budgets that exploded with the growing use of fixed sentences, and partly by a public sense that life in prison has become so comfortable that prisoners live better behind bars than they did on the street.


Tanglewood Opens With Celebrations And a Bawdy Theme
There is always plenty to celebrate at Tanglewood, it seems, and this season the excellent Tanglewood Festival Chorus, observing its 25th anniversary, is the main order of business.
Led this afternoon by its founding director, John Oliver, the group contributed two sacred works to a program of Mozart's music, ending the festival's opening weekend on a note far different from that on which it began.
For on Friday, Seiji Ozawa led the presiding Boston Symphony Orchestra and the chorus in a program devoted largely to unabashed lust, probably not the sort of thing recent high-minded advocates of thematic programming had in mind.
The evening began with the Overture and Bacchanale from Wagner's "Tannhauser" and ended with Orff's brash "Carmina Burana." In between came two gentler evocations of unrequited love by Enrique Granados, "Quejas, o la Maja y el Ruisenor" ("Laments, or the Lady and the Nightingale"), from "Goyescas," and "Elegia Eterna," sung by Kathleen Battle.


In Mounting Defense, O. J. Simpson's Lawyers Plan to Focus on 3 Themes
Defense lawyers will begin their campaign Monday to prove that O. J. Simpson is not a murderer.
But unless the defendant himself takes the stand, the defense case is unlikely to include anything as dramatic as Mr.
Simpson's struggle, feigned or genuine, to fit into a pair of bloody leather gloves.
Mr.
Simpson's lawyers say their presentation will focus on three major themes.
One is that Mr.
Simpson did not have enough time to kill Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman.
Another is that he never behaved like a killer, either before or after the slayings.
The third is that anything appearing to incriminate him is the product of police bungling or nefariousness.

A Reading, With the Boss as Soloist
A reading, in musicians' parlance, is something between a rehearsal and a performance.
Rehearsals involve painstaking work.
Performances can be exciting or intimidating, usually a little of both.
But all musicians love to read through chamber music, just for fun, with few stops to correct mistakes unless there's a complete train wreck.
Concertgoers seldom get to experience readings.
So it was a potentially interesting idea for Bargemusic, which presents chamber music concerts on an air-conditioned barge near the Brooklyn Bridge, to offer readings on Friday evening of two familiar string quartets.


What Goes On?; Don't Speak Unix? Oh? Try http:www.fooledyou
Whew!
What a tangled tongue we weave when first we practice to navigate the Internet's World Wide Web.
As if the name World Wide Web itself were not Elmer Fuddish enough, the computer addresses needed to find individual sites on the global computer network's fastest-growing service typically come with a standard cacophonous prefix -- http://www -- that is pronounced "aich tee tee pee colon forward slash slash double you double you double you."


Brooklyn Man Killed During a Christening
A Brooklyn man was killed last night when three masked men brandishing guns interrupted a christening ceremony in his apartment and announced a robbery, the police said.
Pierre Saint-Sturin, 54, was holding the ceremony for his grandson inside his apartment at 110 Lenox Road in Flatbush when the intruders made his 15 guests lie on the kitchen floor and stole their jewelry, said Sgt.
Michael Enright of the 67th Precinct.


Rajan Pillai, 47, Fugitive Tycoon
Rajan Pillai, one of Asia's most flamboyant businessmen, died on Friday.
He was 47 years old.
The cause of death was complications from cirrhosis of the liver, said a doctor who had been treating him for the last two years.


Closing a Tax Loophole and Opening Another
Nothing, it seems, gets done easily in Washington, particularly when the issue involves people with a lot of money.
Take the so-called expatriates' tax, a proposal intended to close a loophole with which a relatively few very wealthy Americans have avoided millions of dollars in income and estate taxes by renouncing their citizenship and moving abroad to countries with lower tax rates or more porous laws.


Under Construction: A Music Leader
For years MCA Inc.'s music business, while profitable, has lagged far behind the industry leaders.
But the plan to start a new record label under Doug Morris underscores MCA's intention to gain market share -- in part by benefiting from the turmoil at the market leader, the Warner Music Group, a unit of Time Warner Inc.


Mitchell May Be Returning to Japan
The Fukuoka Daiei Hawks have sent officials from Tokyo to meet KEVIN MITCHELL in Los Angeles and find out whether he has recovered from a knee injury and can return.
Mitchell left the team in May after a dispute over the severity of his injury, and the Hawks suspended him.
The team sent the officials after Mitchell's agent said in a letter to the club that he has recovered and wants to play in Japan again.
The Hawks want to know whether Mitchell can play in all 45 of the Hawks' games after Japan's All-Star Game break July 25-26.
In 28 games, he was batting .247 with six home runs.


Horror Hero of the 90's, Half Man, Half Bomb
Roger Corman is a film maker who specializes in, for lack of a more elegant bon mot, schlock.
And in an era in which schlock threatens to become the artistic norm, Mr.
Corman is riding high, courted by cable television and movie buffs hooked on cult junk.
His latest project: "Roger Corman Presents," a series of 13 new films (four of them remakes of Corman "classics") getting under way tonight on Showtime, the same pay-cable service that devoted much of last summer to a biker-movie tribute called "Rebel Highway." For Showtime, apparently, junk pays.
As producer, director or both, Mr.
Corman has more than 300 movies to his credit, going back to horror romps of the 1950's and 60's like "The Fall of the House of Usher" and "The Tomb of Ligeia." He was a master of the cheap drive-in staple, and, appropriately enough, he popped up on Saturday for an interview on the Movie Channel's "Joe Bob's Drive-In Theater" as the host, Joe Bob Briggs, presented two Corman chestnuts: "Caroline at Midnight" and "Dinosaur Island."


PNC Buying Midlantic for $3 Billion
In one more sign that independent banking in New Jersey is fast becoming a thing of the past, the PNC Bank Corporation, based in Pittsburgh, announced yesterday that it would acquire the Midlantic Corporation, based in Edison, N.J., for $3 billion in stock.
Just last month, the First Union Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., announced that it would buy the First Fidelity Bancorp of Newark for $5.4 billion and create a banking empire stretching along the East Coast from Connecticut to Florida.


International Briefs; Abbey National Plans A Big Acquisition
Abbey National P.L.C. said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the National and Provincial Building Society for $:1.35 billion, or $2.16 billion, cementing Abbey's position as the second-largest mortgage lender in Britain.
The price that Abbey will pay for the mutually owned building society, which is similar to a savings and loan in the United States, represents an 84 percent premium to National and Provincial's net assets of $:732 million.


The Summer's Films: Some Hits and Misses
A lot of us haven't gone on vacation yet, but by Hollywood's reckoning the summer season is almost over.
Why?
Because all but a handful of summer films have been released, and those to come will be here soon.
They include Kevin Costner's hugely expensive, troubled and much-chronicled epic, "Waterworld," which is to open on July 28, and "Nine Months," which opens on Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles (elsewhere on Friday).
An otherwise innocuous comedy, "Nine Months" has stirred unusual interest because its star, Hugh Grant, was arrested with a prostitute in Hollywood two weeks ago.


Largest U.S. Funeral Chain to Acquire Europe's Biggest, in France
Service Corporation Inc., the world's largest chain of funeral homes and cemeteries, announced an agreement yesterday to buy Europe's largest funeral business, based in France, for $423 million.
The purchase would accelerate Service Corporation's conquest of a region where, last year, it agreed to buy the two largest publicly held funeral companies in Britain.
In agreeing to buy the funeral operations of Lyonnaise des Eaux of France, Service Corporation is betting on potential, not current performance.
It would hope to raise the business's current operating profit margin, a thin 7 percent before taxes, closer to its own 30 percent-plus by increasing efficiency, taking advantage of deregulation and persuading the French to spend more on funerals.


CHRONICLE
Conceding, "I did a bad thing; there you have it," HUGH GRANT was greeted by cheering crowds and applause yesterday as he appeared on "The Tonight Show."
It was Mr.
Grant's first public appearance since his arrest with a prostitute last month.


FINANCE BRIEFS
Debt  Federal Farm Credit Bank is selling $100 million of medium-term notes due in 1997 through Smith Barney Inc.
Callable in six months, the issue is priced at par to yield 6 percent.


MCA Hands Studio Reins to Agent
By naming Ron Meyer, a top talent agent at the Creative Artists Agency, to run the television and film businesses of MCA Inc. today, Edgar G. Bronfman Jr. has signaled to Hollywood and Wall Street that he wants to move quickly to revive a studio that has been sluggish in recent years.
Mr.
Bronfman today formally announced Mr.
Meyer's appointment as president and chief operating officer of MCA at the same time he confirmed that MCA had completed a deal with Doug Morris, who was recently dismissed as chairman of Warner Music's domestic music business, to start a record label.
News of both moves, which leaked out only on Sunday night, surprised many in Hollywood.

N.C.A.A. Investigation Clears Marbury
The National Collegiate Athletic Association has decided that STEPHON MARBURY's amateur status was not violated when the Georgia Tech recruit was given a car by the director of an amateur basketball program, university officials said yesterday.


Q&amp;A
Cowbird Instincts
Q.
How does a cowbird from an egg deposited in another species' nest grow up to know it is a cowbird?
A.
Apparently by a well-developed genetic instinct, said Dr.
Ken Rosenberg of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology in Ithaca, N.Y.


Just 9 Devils Visit the White House
When the Devils visited the White House today to show off their Stanley Cup, President Clinton was just returning from a visit to, of all places, Nashville.
Far from an omen, the President's itinerary was rendered more of a footnote with word that the team and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority were close to striking a deal to keep the Devils from moving to Tennessee.
That's why Lou Lamoriello, the team's president and general manager, was not on hand for the celebration.
Unfortunately, few others on the team appeared to have as good an excuse for skipping the visit.


U.S. Envoy Visits Crusader in Chinese Jail
Three weeks after he was seized by Chinese authorities, Harry Wu, the American human rights advocate charged with espionage, was permitted a jailhouse interview with the American consul general today.
But his jailers ordered him not to discuss the charges against him, State Department officials said.
Mr.
Wu spoke with the American consul, Arturo Macias, for about 30 minutes from behind a thick glass partition, over a telephone monitored by the authorities.
He said he was not suffering at the hands of his jailers, but Mr.
Macias learned little about the precise nature of the charges or about Mr.
Wu's immediate prospects, the officials said.


The Gephardt Tax Plan
The tax plan proposed last week by the House minority leader, Richard Gephardt, though flawed, finally puts Democrats into the House debate over tax reform.
It also establishes an important principle that Republicans would like to ignore.
True tax reform should preserve fairness by making high-income families bear a heavier burden than poor families.
The major Republican plans twist the code against middle- and low-income families.
Mr.
Gephardt would eliminate taxes for millions of low-income families and reduce tax rates to an eye-catching 10 percent for families earning up to about $60,000 a year.
That leaves about 75 percent of taxpayers paying rates of 10 percent or less.
Families earning more would pay progressively higher rates, topping out at 34 percent.
These progressive rates stand in bold contrast to the flat-tax plan of the majority leader, Dick Armey, and the sales-tax plan of Bill Archer, chairman of the tax-writing committee.
Under these plans, most families would pay about the same rate.


SERB FORCES FIGHT DUTCH U.N. TROOPS IN EASTERN BOSNIA
Bosnian Serb forces, defying a United Nations warning issued only the day before, clashed tonight with Dutch peacekeepers guarding the entrance to a beleaguered town in eastern Bosnia.
The small garrison of United Nations peacekeepers on the edge of the town, Srebrenica, requested NATO air protection, but an air attack was called off when the fighting subsided, United Nations officials here said.

Power Tennis
Pete Sampras produced a tour de force in power tennis Sunday, winning his third consecutive Wimbledon singles title with a majestic, well-mannered victory over Boris Becker.
The serve-and-volley cognoscenti had to reach back to the days of Pancho Gonzalez or Jack Kramer to recall anything like the speed and precision of the Sampras attack.
Mr.
Becker, no slouch at the power game himself, managed to win the first set in a tie-breaker, but did not come close to breaking Mr.
Sampras's serve the entire day.
The esthetics of the match were not as satisfying.
While the rapid-fire exchanges were more entertaining than endless baseline rallies, it was tempting to wish for a more refined game in which nearly all points are not decided by a service ace or an immediate volley.
Fastball pitchers can be great to watch, but baseball becomes static when most batters strike out.


Women in Senate Seek Hearings on Packwood
Five of the eight women in the Senate, including one Republican, have called for public hearings into the accusations of sexual and official misconduct against Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon.
"We believe that the reputation of the Senate and the public's interest are best served by open hearings on a matter of such grave importance," the women wrote in a letter to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is chairman of the Select Committee on Ethics.


How an Opportunistic Bacterium Blitzes Its Way Through the Gut
FROM the annals of "Why bother to reinvent the wheel?' and "There's no such thing as a better mousetrap" comes the extraordinary tale of Shigella flexneri's so-called comet tail.
Shigella is a disagreeable rod-shaped bacterium that causes severe diarrhea in humans, spreading so quickly and stealthily through the gut that a person's immune system has no chance to respond.


Warning Against Quick Medicare Cuts
The nation's largest hospital association today warned that Congressional Republicans were moving too fast in their effort to overhaul the Medicare program in the next 90 days.
Officials of the American Hospital Association, at a news conference here, renewed their call for the creation of an independent commission to find long-term solutions to the escalating costs of the 30-year-old insurance program that now covers 37 million elderly Americans.

BUSINESS DIGEST
S.&amp; P. Lowers Rating On New York City Debt  Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its rating of New York City's long-term debt, attributing the downgrading to the sluggish local economy and rebuking Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for what it called financial gimmickry in balancing the city's budget.
The decision reduced the city's bond rating from A-minus, where it has been since 1987, to BBB-plus, among the lowest ratings of any major city in the country.  [ Page A1. ]


Yankees Looking for Summer Wake-Up
Buck Showalter has fielded more questions about Darryl Strawberry than about Paul O'Neill.
George Steinbrenner has sat next to the Yankee dugout more this season than he did all last season.
Danny Tartabull has asked to be traded more frequently than he has asked to have one of his home run balls retrieved.
Don Mattingly's greatest display of emotion was over a replacement player called up to pitch.
And Jimmy Key finished the season with one more victory than the bat boy.
Is the fuzzy picture coming into focus?


In Blow to Mayor, Credit Agency Lowers New York's Bond Rating
A major credit agency yesterday lowered its rating of New York City's long-term credit worthiness, citing both the sluggish economy and fiscal gimmicks it said were used by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to balance the city's budget.
The decision by Standard &amp; Poor's lowers the city's rating from A-, where it has been since 1987, to BBB+, among the lowest ratings of any major city in the country.
Of major cities, only Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington have lower ratings.


Medical Breakthroughs Require Caution
To the Editor:
Miriam Shuchman and Michael S. Wilkes in "Medical Breakthroughs, on Line" (Op-Ed, July 7) argue that the public is entitled to swifter access to medical findings via computer services.
They cite a study that found patients with high blood pressure treated with calcium channel blockers had a higher chance of a heart attack than similar patients treated with other medications.
This was presented at a scientific meeting in March, and the authors blame journals for delaying communication in the press about this finding.


Sandoz Buying Genetic Therapy for $295 Million
Sandoz Ltd. said yesterday that it would acquire Genetic Therapy Inc. of Gaithersburg, Md., for about $295 million, or $21 a share.
Since 1991, Sandoz, based in Basel, Switzerland, has owned 3.6 percent of Genetic Therapy, a leading gene-therapy company working on treatments for cancer, AIDS, cystic fibrosis, hemophilia and Gaucher's disease, an inherited enzyme deficiency disorder.


Review/Fashion; Going One-Up On Street Fashion
Truly innovative fashion affects the eye a little like the test for glaucoma at the ophthalmologist's office: it startles and is momentarily discomforting.
Paris is the capital of that sort of fashion, so new it makes you blink.
Designers here can produce the unheard-of, which in fashion is the unseen -- something that after hundreds of years of fashion design, thousands of shows and millions of garments still looks new.
If the men's wear shown in Milan, Italy, this season seemed particularly exciting, it was because expectations had been lowered by years of Milanese houses producing only the expected.
And if the men's wear for next spring and summer that was shown here seemed particularly dull, it was because this is, after all, where the world's most interesting designers show.
But it seemed as if most were already mentally lounging on a deck chair in Deauville.


Crop Duster Killed in Crash
A pilot for a blueberry farm was killed early yesterday when his helicopter went down in a wooded area in Hamilton Township near Atlantic City.


Mild, Modest Teen-Ager Knows How to Seize a Championship

A Battle on the Waterfront; Conflicting Visions for the Renewal of the Passaic River
It is unusual for a skipper to advise his passengers to remove their bright red life jackets in midstream to be safe, but the stretch of the Passaic River flowing through downtown Newark is no ordinary waterway.
"I tell people to take their life jackets off because they make an easy target," said Paul J. Lerin, a self-appointed guide who hopes to turn his love of the river into an environmental cleanup business.
"We are in a sniper zone here."

Cowboys' Haley Decides Not to Retire
The All-Pro defensive end CHARLES HALEY has gone from retirement talk to a commitment to play for the Dallas Cowboys until 1999.
A $12 million package turned the trick.
"I want to play every year with everything I've got," Haley said yesterday.
"I want to retire a Cowboy." (AP)


Review/Fashion; Couture Follows Ready-to-Wear
Couture fashion inspires extremes: either you're thrilled at the heights the art form can achieve or you question the motives of the clients who take the front rows.
So it makes perfect sense that Jamie Lee Curtis, wearing her free, white-tweed Gianni Versace couture dress, should declare his show "astonishing," "fabulous" and "as good as you get," while a skeptical Meg Ryan, in her own black leather jacket, attending her first (and probably her last) couture show, said, "I've always been curious what it's about, and now I'm not curious." She added, apologetically, "They are beautiful clothes, though."


Microsoft Hits High on News Of Software
The Microsoft Corporation announced yesterday that it would begin shipping an updated collection of its top-selling software applications on Aug. 24, the same day it is scheduled to release Windows 95, its next generation of operating system software for personal computers.
Investors, which seem to view the future of dozens of computer hardware and software companies as riding on the success of Windows 95, responded by pushing Microsoft's stock to a record high.


Hospital Investigates 2 Suicides
Responding to what appears to be the second suicide in four months by a teen-age patient at the Bergen Pines County Hospital's psychiatric unit, County Executive William P. Schuber said yesterday that he was creating a three-member panel to investigate procedures at the county-run institution.


Shadows of Chinatown: A special report.; Portrait of Man as Mobster Stirs Community's Disbelief
Sprawling across the second floor of a shopping arcade beneath the Manhattan Bridge in Chinatown, the Triple Eight Palace is a popular spot for dim sum.
But in one of its private rooms on a February night in 1992, Federal prosecutors contend, the menu was revenge.
The hierarchy of the Tung On gang had gathered there to plot retaliation for a rash of assaults by the rival Ghost Shadows.
Participants told investigators that Paul H. K. Lai, a well-known businessman, complained angrily that the attacks on the gang that protected his gambling interests had diminished his status.


Integrated Program Smooths Your Path
PERFECTWORKS FOR WINDOWS, version 2.1, is a major integrated program that challenges the leaders in the field, Microsoft Works and Clarisworks.
Integrated programs, which perform several tasks with one piece of software, are usually thought of as beginners' fare, but they can benefit anyone who must run word-processing, spreadsheet, database, painting, drawing and communications programs and who does not want to face the expense and steep learning curve of major titles in each category.
Perfectworks covers all six categories, and does them well.
I will cite the word-processing category for examples, because that is the program I and, indeed most people use most of the time.
In fact I am writing these words with it.
But the other modules are similar, as Microsoft Windows programs should be, and you can switch from writing to drawing to spreadsheeting without having to relearn everything from scratch.


One Is Dead In Rampage On East Side
A man who became enraged in a domestic dispute stabbed his wife and mother-in-law and a 2-year-old child in a Manhattan apartment last night, killing the older woman, a family member said.
He then stabbed another woman, commandeered her car and drove on a wild 45-minute ride on the East Side, hitting at least 17 pedestrians and critically injuring at least two of them.
After police patrol cars finally forced the man's car to smash into a light pole on Avenue C between Eighth and Ninth Streets, the man tried to commit suicide by stabbing himself several times in the chest, the police and witnesses said.
He was listed in critical condition last night at St.
Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center.


Heat and Strangeness Dominate a Fortnight Ruled by the Full Moon
Along with the oddity of finding itself caught in a heat wave that seared its lawns and, despite the switch to heavier balls, kept the aces coming so strongly that even second serves qualified, Wimbledon also seemed to be under the spell of a full moon in this year, the 109th of its presentation.
There were some strange goings-on, most of them unprecedented at the tradition-conscious Grand Slam event, which usually inspires participants to be on their best behavior.


Bash It All You Want; It's Still a Great Game
All right, let everyone get it out of his system.
This is baseball's All-Star Game break, but let's make it baseball's Bash Break.
Yesterday's gone, but spend all day today -- and tomorrow, if your team isn't resuming the season -- bashing baseball and be done with it.
Baseball bashing is the popular sport to play these days.
And the arrival of the All-Star Game on the schedule prompted an even greater gush of assessments and critiques of the state of Major League Baseball.
Some news outlets in recent days acted as if they had discovered for the first time that fans have rebelled.


Simpson Defense Portrays a Man in Shock
Lawyers for O. J. Simpson began his defense today, seeking to establish before anything else that he was grief-stricken and distraught rather than detached and concerned primarily for himself when he was told that Nicole Brown Simpson was slain.
Arms around one another's shoulders as the defendant sat out of reach nearby, members of Mr.
Simpson's family filled the front row on the defendant's side of the gallery as court convened, much as they had gathered at Mr.
Simpson's home on North Rockingham Drive on June 13, 1994, shortly after Mrs.
Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman were killed.


Free Harry Wu
In a cruel miscalculation, China has seized an American citizen and human rights activist, Harry Wu, and made him a victim of deteriorating relations with Washington.
Over the weekend, they charged Mr.
Wu with offenses that could bring his execution.
The Clinton Administration rightly warns Beijing that it risks gravely damaging relations should it persist.
That is strong diplomatic language.
But the Administration's reaction is moderate compared to that in Congress, where Mr.
Wu has frequently testified in recent years and has made many friends.
China will not be able to bully and bluster its way past this issue as it has with too many human rights issues in the past.
Beijing must release Harry Wu.


New Jersey Top Court Backs Old-Fashioned Child Support
Upholding New Jersey's child-support guidelines, the State Supreme Court today rejected a divorced father's arguments that his support payments should be reduced so he can spend the money as he sees fit when he is caring for his children.
The ruling today, in a case involving James Pascale, a divorced father of three who pays $1,150 a month in child support, overturns a ruling by a state appellate court.
More broadly, it runs counter to a trend in other jurisdictions to develop equations for child support that take into account both the time and the money contributed by a parent that does not have primary responsibility for maintaining the home for the children.

New Prosthesis for One-Legged Player
TOMAS MURRAY, who with one leg helped carry Panama's basketball team to a gold-medal round at the Special Olympic World Games, is being fitted for a new prosthesis, compliments of Newington Children's Hospital in Hartford.
Murray, who is 20, lost his left leg near the hip in a train accident when he was 7.


Possessed by Tics and Noises
Tourette syndrome may not be a killer condition, but it is an embarrassing one.
To outsiders, the 100,000 Americans who have it may seem possessed, given to tics, spasms and noises that are likely to startle others in the vicinity.
As someone says on "Twitch and Shout," tonight's vibrant offering in the "P.O.V." series, "What people don't understand, they fear." Laurel Chiten's documentary helps us understand that what seems like peculiar or even menacing behavior is brought on by neurological causes and is absolutely no danger to bystanders.
Lowell Handler, a photojournalist who, like Ms.
Chiten, has Tourette syndrome, introduces us to an actress whose eyebrows have a way of twitching provocatively of their own accord, except when she is performing; a professional basketball player whose compulsive jerks and gestures seem part of his game; an artist, a more severe case, who works with a seeming wildness that otherwise emerges in what he calls freaky movements, and others similarly afflicted.
After a few minutes in their company, the symptoms do not seem all that strange, if strange at all.


The First Day Is a Long One at the Privatized D.M.V.
David Green arrived bright and early this morning at the newly privatized motor vehicle office to take the test for a truck-driver's license.
His promptness did not help.
Mr.
Green, of New Milford, spent an hour in line before a newly hired clerk took his application and other paperwork about 9 A.M.
Then he waited for another new clerk to call his name for the start of the test.
And he waited.
One hour.
Two hours.
Three hours.
Noon passed, and still no mention of his name.


City's Bond Rating: Did Giuliani Do Enough to Help It?
For months, the Giuliani administration watched as the downgrading of New York City's credit rating approached like a slow-moving but inexorable train.
Yesterday, after the train had struck and moved on, the question around City Hall was whether Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani might have done anything to move out of the way.
Even his critics agreed with the Mayor that there was an element of unfairness in the decision by the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation to lower its rating on the city's long-term bonds, which the agency said was based mostly on the sluggishness of the city's economy.


Batters To Get Room To Breathe
When the moves to speed up the pace of games are announced, presumably on Tuesday, they will not be as previously advertised.
With players complaining bitterly about the owners' announcement a month ago that they would have to stay in the batter's box, a committee representing the clubs, the players and the umpires has decided to allow batters to continue leaving the box, but has restricted the distance they can stray.


Traffic Alert
Because of continuing work on the water main that ruptured Sunday, 40th Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway is expected to be closed to traffic again today.


International Briefs; Thomson in Deal to Sell 5 Newspapers in Britain
Trinity International Holdings P.L.C. said yesterday that it had agreed to buy five British newspapers from the Thomson Corporation of Canada for $:327.5 million, or $522.4 million, creating one of the biggest provincial newspaper groups in Britain.
The five newspapers, including The Belfast Telegraph in Northern Ireland and The Western Mail in Cardiff, Wales, are part of Thomson Regional Newspapers Ltd., a unit of the Canadian company.
The parent company is undergoing a major revamping, including the sale of 46 newspapers in North America.


An Israeli Whirlpool of Movement and Emotion
Batsheva Dance Company, the Israeli modern-dance troupe that has just performed at Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival for the first time, is a company reborn.
In "Mabul," a vigorous 75-minute work that was presented at the Ted Shawn Theater here on Saturday night, ceaseless originality fuses with eye-riveting energy.
The entire work rushes on like a maelstrom.
Unrelated images are not strung together in the usual nonlinear structure but thrown into a whirlpool of movement and emotions before splattering across the stage with centrifugal force.
Episodes are connected unpredictably.


Pope Calls for an End to Discrimination Against Women
In a special letter issued in Rome in advance of a United Nations international conference on women, Pope John Paul II said yesterday that after centuries of discrimination, equality for women was now a matter not only of justice, but also of necessity.
The letter, addressed to women throughout the world, gave credit to the women's movement for its "substantially positive" achievements, and assumed responsibility for injustices against women committed in the name of the Roman Catholic Church.
But he made clear that there would be no change in the church's position barring women from the priesthood.


Tarango Ducks Confrontation With Rosset
The hot-tempered JEFF TARANGO has withdrawn from the Swiss Open in Gstaad for fear of a confrontation with an angry MARC ROSSET, tournament officials said yesterday.
At Wimbledon, Tarango had accused the French umpire BRUNO REBEUH of being "the most corrupt official in the game," and alleged that Rebeuh had shown bias to players in return for friendship.
He named Rosset, the Olympic champion from Switzerland, as one of those who had benefited from the official's favoritism.
Tarango stormed off the court during his third-round match against ALEXANDER MRONZ of Germany after a dispute with Rebeuh over a line call.
Tarango's French wife, BENEDICTE, then slapped the official twice on the face.
Tarango was fined a record $15,500 for the outburst and may face additional fines or a suspension after an investigation.


Prairie Dog Colonies Bolster Life in the Plains
A RISING sun was just beginning to illuminate the harsh beauty of the Badlands when an early-rising prairie dog emerged from one of thousands of small dirt mounds decorating a swale of the Great Plains.
By midmorning the ground was alive with the golden-tan, foot-long rodents, which are only now becoming recognized as an ecologically crucial species with uncommon power to affect the lives and surroundings of other creatures.
"Look at that landscape out there," said Dr.
Glenn E. Plumb, the wildlife biologist for Badlands National Park, as he gazed out across the prairie-dog town.
"That's a real concentration of biological activity, a lot of complex nature."


By Design; No Gilding of Lilies
Minimal, classic and even conservative are the words to describe the current state of fashion.
Anything fussy or overdecorated just doesn't look cool.
Influential designers have pared down their clothes and the way they are shown, and the trend-setting young women about town have followed suit.
They're tucking their stick-straight hair behind their ears and keeping accessories to a minimum.
Jewelry is almost nonexistent.
When it is worn, it is subtle.
A pair of delicate drop earrings passes muster, and diamond studs have been rediscovered by those with pierced ears.
About the only jewelry worn in multiples is rings.
But forget that old idea of rings on every finger.
The stylish today wear multiples on one finger, stacking narrow bands up to the knuckle, usually on the traditional ring finger.


Samuel Woolley, 86; Engineered Mergers At Bank of New York
Samuel H. Woolley, an executive who helped turn the Bank of New York Corporation into one of the nation's largest financial institutions, died on Sunday at his home in Morris Plains, N.J.
He was 86.
As the chairman and chief executive of the Bank of New York, Mr.
Woolley engineered a series of deals that transformed it from a New York City bank into a statewide bank holding company.


Officer Convicted of Brutality
Ronald M. Johnstone, a Kearny police officer described by prosecutors as someone who would "beat first and asked questions later," was convicted of six brutality charges yesterday by a Federal jury.
But a second officer, Richard Poplaski, was acquitted by the same jury of the one count against him, The Associated Press reported.
The case involved a series of incidents between February 1990 and September 1991.
Mr.
Johnstone's lawyer said an appeal was planned.


What's in a Name? Many Others
THESE languid days of summer demand new and novel ways to be unproductive.
For those who lack the imagination needed to swing in a hammock while discerning pictures in the clouds, or the stamina to listen to talk radio, the personal computer can be a valuable tool.
A computer can generate anagrams, for example.


Maryland Players Suspended for Gambling
Maryland's starting quarterback, SCOTT MILANOVICH, and four other school athletes were suspended by the National Collegiate Athletic Association yesterday for gambling on college games.
The school will appeal the two harshest judgments of the five; they are believed to be the most severe sanctions ever levied against Division I athletes for a gambling offense.


Union Objects to Imported, Exploited Musicians
To the Editor:
Your reviewer of the State Philharmonic of Bialystok, Poland (July 4), seems to believe that we are arguing with the presence of foreign orchestras in New York on the basis of quality as well as price.
Local 802 has no desire to complain when any orchestra visits New York to perform as a featured group.
We believe it is valuable for the public, including our members, to be exposed to new repertory and new performances of standard literature.
A Polish orchestra can bring a unique musical experience to the stage.


Sandoz Sharpens Its Focus on the Drugs of Tomorrow
The acquisition of Genetic Therapy Inc., a small American biotechnology company, by Sandoz Ltd. is the latest part of the big Swiss company's strategy to remake itself by concentrating on its pharmaceutical business, including biotech therapies that it believes will be the treatments of tomorrow.
The Sandoz approach is to stand firmly on two legs in the health care business: One is drugs, where the company is weaving a web of alliances with small, fast-growing research companies in biotechnology; the other is nutrition, where Sandoz hopes to catch the growing markets for infants and the elderly and for specialized products for hospital patients.
Part of this included a $3.7 billion acquisition last year of the Gerber Products Company, the American baby-food producer.


Sports of The Times; Between All The Clouds, A Rising Sun
As he listened to the questions being translated into Japanese, his sunglasses were perched atop his blue "LA" cap and he held his hands behind his blue jersey with "Dodgers" in white across the chest above a red 16.
Sometimes he smiled, sometimes he shook his head, sometimes he muttered, "Mmmmmmm." But when Hideo Nomo was asked if he was overwhelmed by all this attention, he answered quickly, in English.
"Yes," he said.


By Abstention, Eight Teachers Gain Tenure
Eight of 11 teachers were granted tenure by default tonight when conservative school board members, elected to cut taxes, abstained from a vote on tenure, a practice they had pledged to abolish.
Just before the tenure vote, the board unanimously decided that a teacher would obtain tenure if a majority of board members abstained.


Gene Gun Could Treat Hair Loss
IN a promising step in studies of hair growth, researchers at a biotechnology company in California have found a way to fire genetic "bullets" at hair follicles, the tiny hair-making factories in the skin.
"We think this delivery system opens the whole hair-loss field to the possibility of gene therapy," said Dr.
Robert M. Hoffman, the founder and president of Anticancer Inc., a biotechnology company in San Diego.
He and the company's senior scientist, Dr.
Lingna Li, reported their findings in the July issue of the journal Nature Medicine.


State Gets Aid for Homeless
New Jersey will receive $26.7 million of the $900 million in aid to the homeless announced yesterday by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Paterson, the biggest recipient in the state, will get $7.5 million to provide housing and counseling for 82 homeless people with chronic substance-abuse problems or AIDS.


Managua Journal; For the Pride of Nicaragua, a Home Run in Politics?
In the United States, Dennis Martinez is regarded by baseball fans as a crafty veteran pitcher, an All-Star, the ace of the Cleveland Indians' staff.
Here in his baseball-mad homeland, such achievements are enough to have vaulted him to the status of national hero and possible future President.
"Dennis Martinez is a factor of national unity and pride who is perhaps the most popular man in Nicaragua," said Edgard Castillo, a former sports and foreign news editor at the newspaper La Prensa here.
"Everyone likes and admires him, whether they are Communists or conservatives."


Defying U.S. Threat, Bolivians Plant More Coca
At the coca market in this remote jungle village, where farmers lug 50-pound bags of coca leaves for miles on their backs and bicycles, the talk is of little else but the demands by the United States that Bolivia cut its coca production.
"I don't care how much pressure they put on us to stop growing coca, we will never give this up because we have no other means to survive," said Delfin Olivera, a 24-year-old farmer.
"Coca is natural, it's part of our culture, and it has been here since the beginning of the world."


Jumbo-Jet Plan Is Scrapped By Boeing and Europeans
The Boeing Company and its prospective European partners have decided not to produce a "super jumbo" jetliner capable of carrying 600 to 800 passengers because of a lack of demand from airlines, company officials said yesterday.
But Boeing officials said the company was still considering production of a 500-passenger aircraft by stretching its existing 747 model and was studying a supersonic plane it calls the High Speed Civil Transport.


Corrections
An article on Thursday about a testing proposal by the American Federation of Teachers misstated the union's relative size.

The 75th New Jersey Open, the state's premier tournament, got under way with a fund-raising pro-am yesterday and will finish Thursday at the North Jersey Country Club in Wayne as a highlight of the club's centennial celebration.


Buena Vista Journal; Inundated by Rain, These Folks Wouldn't Move Even for Noah
Speculators banking on bountiful iron ore built this factory town beside a lazy river in the late 1890's, promising an infant Pittsburgh in "Bonnie Buena Vista."
But the iron ran out, and now the river threatens to drown their dream.
Ten days ago, as a submersible pump slurped out City Hall after two floods in six days, a child's drawing in the front hall proclaimed a plaintive new slogan, "Buena Vista: A City Worth Saving."


Corrections
A report in the Guide column of the Connecticut Weekly on Sunday about Canaan Railroad Days misstated the schedule.
The road race, hayride and softball tournament will be this Sunday, July 16, and the country-western concert will be Monday, July 17; they were not held this week.
The arts and crafts show, fireworks and other events will be on July 22, not this Saturday.


Patterns
Flattery Is Lost on Tahari
When it comes to fashion design, the sincerest form of flattery is wholly unwelcome.
Nevertheless, imitating another designer's creations is a way of life on Seventh Avenue, where the aggrieved, real or otherwise, can do little more than complain publicly about knockoffs.


Court Upholds Child Support
The New Jersey Supreme Court yesterday upheld the state's child-support guidelines, rejecting a divorced father's arguments for modifying them.
James Pascale of East Windsor had argued that his child-support payments should be reduced so he could spend the difference the way he chooses when he visits his three children.


Simple Chip Could Mean Control Over TV Violence
The chip that President Clinton referred to in his speech yesterday is a relatively simple and inexpensive device that would enable parents to block television programs transmitted with a signal identifying them as violent or otherwise inappropriate for children.
A V-chip (the "V" stands for violence) could be installed in a television set for as little as $5.
Although the President talked of installing them in "televisions with cable," in fact they could work with broadcast signals as well.
The main factor is not the chip itself, but in whether or not programs are transmitted with an identifying signal.


Only Peace Talks Can Save Northern Ireland
To The Editor:
During the past few days Belfast and Londonderry have been the scene of street riots, which included firebombing of cars and trucks (front page, July 6).
Most significant, the police have also been attacked.
The next step will be the use of guns.
If the rioting continues, the police will fire plastic bullets.
In the past those bullets have killed and maimed.
After that would come the I.R.A.'s use of guns against the police and the British Army, and the story comes full circle.


Helene Johnson, Poet of Harlem, 89, Dies
Helene Johnson, one of the Harlem Renaissance poets who flourished in the 1920's, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan.
She was 89.
Ms.
Johnson, a descendant of slaves, was reared in Boston and in Oak Bluffs, Mass.
She came to New York City in 1927 and became, as the author and longtime librarian of Fisk University, Arna Bontemps, once put it, "the youngest of the young poets and writers who brought about the Negro renaissance, as it was called in Harlem in the 20's." That cultural flowering wilted in the Depression.


Dispute Over Killer's Drug Use
Last month, Darnell Collins of Atlantic City went on a five-day shooting rampage in New Jersey and New York, killing seven people and wounding four others before dying in a shootout with the police.
Friends and relatives said Mr.
Collins, a convicted felon, was a heavy cocaine user who became abusive when he was high.
But New Jersey's Bureau of Parole, which had been responsible for supervising Mr.
Collins after his release from prison in January 1994, said his most recent drug tests -- on Jan. 19 and May 17 -- had been negative.


Region News Briefs; Nassau Retools Budget For High-Salary College
Nassau County officials said today that they had closed an $8 million gap in the new Nassau Community College budget, a revenue shortfall that the college's critics contend was largely a result of the school's extraordinarily high faculty salaries.
The gap in the proposed $118.8 million budget for 1995-96 was erased by transferring money from other county accounts, including the general fund and the police budget, said David A. Vieser, a spokesman for Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County Executive.


From Depths of the Draft to a Spot at Shea
Jason Isringhausen said he had no illusions about being selected by the Mets all the way down in the 44th round of the 1991 amateur draft.

Head of Democratic Opposition Is Released by Burmese Military
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Prize-winning opposition leader in Myanmar, formerly Burma, was released today from house arrest after nearly six years of confinement by the nation's military junta.
The release of Mrs.

No Need to Wait For Electric Vehicles
To the Editor:
Re "Plan Could Again Delay the Electric Car" (news article, July 4): Gov.
William Weld of Massachusetts, in a compromise with auto manufacturers, proposes to delay demanding that Detroit produce vehicles that meet the zero emission standard until two years after a manufacturer anywhere in the world builds an electric car that meets a set of criteria on performance and price.


Rebuffing Clinton, Dole Seeks End to Bosnian Arms Embargo
Spurning President Clinton's attempt to build support for his Bosnia policy, Senator Bob Dole said today that he planned to bring legislation to the Senate floor that would lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government in conjunction with a withdrawal of United Nations peacekeeping forces.
Mr.
Dole signaled that he would move ahead with the bill as early as next week, and he did so just hours before a White House dinner for the Congressional leadership, which Mr.
Clinton had called to discuss foreign policy issues and fend off the rising demands for a United Nations withdrawal from Bosnia.
"The time for make-believe is over," the majority leader said.
"The U.N. mission in Bosnia is a failure."

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.


Paris Defends Seizing Ship in Atom Test Zone
France today brushed aside a wave of international protests against the boarding and seizure by French Navy commandos in the South Pacific of a ship carrying protesters against its plans to resume underground nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll in September.
"France will command respect for the measures it has decided to take by requiring respect for legality in its territorial waters," Prime Minister Alain Juppe said.

RESULTS PLUS
TRACK Victory for Mutola  Maria Mutola of Mozambique narrowly missed the world record in the women's 1,000 meters and Michael Johnson turned in another impressive 200 meters yesterday in the DN Games Grand Prix meet in Stockholm.
Competing for the first time at Olympic Stadium, Mutola was timed in 2 minutes 30.72 seconds, just 5-hundredths of a second off the world record.
It was the second fastest time ever in the seldom-contested distance, which is not on any championship schedule.
Regina Jacobs of the United States finished second in 2:35.46.
Johnson, ranked No. 1 in the world at 200 and 400 meters, took the 200 in a fast 20.15 in slight head wind after easing up near the finish. (AP) TENNIS Muster Streak Stopped Top-seeded Thomas Muster had his 40-match winning streak on clay ended yesterday when he was beaten in the first round of the $560,000 Swiss Open tournament in Gstaad, Sweden.

In Rivera, Uruguay, World Cup champion Brazil, bidding for its fifth America Cup title, scored two late goals last night to beat Peru, 2-0, and qualify for the second round.
Brazil scored in the 77th minute on a penalty kick by Zinho.
Six minutes later Edmundo took advantage of a rebound off Peruvian goalkeeper Miguel Miranda to score.
The Brazilians joined Uruguay in the second round of the 12-nation championships.
Earlier last night, Colombia beat Ecuador, 1-0, to move closer to the second round.
Ecuador was virtually eliminated after its second straight loss.

Only Peace Talks Can Save Northern Ireland; Empty Promises

The release of British Pvt.
Lee Clegg from prison for the murder of an Irish teen-ager (news article, July 4) only adds to the growing belief that Britain is not serious about the peace process.
In looking back on past events, Britain has only reacted to the situation and rarely, if ever, initiated a positive response.


Orthodox Judges Overturn Betrothal of a Minor
First, Sarah Leah Goldstein was ambushed by a biblical passage that had been ignored for centuries.
Then she was saved by a voice from beyond the grave.
A special assembly of Orthodox Jewish religious judges declared yesterday that Miss Goldstein, whose father betrothed her at age 11 to a man whose identity he would not reveal, was free to marry anyone she pleased.


Monumental Inventory of Insects in a Costa Rican Forest Is Under Way
IN a high-tech laboratory in the middle of one of the world's lushest and most creature-filled rain forests, Dr.
Jack Longino is watching the digitized images of ant faces flashing across a computer screen.
Next to him a technician is passing a procession of beetles labeled with bar codes in front of a scanner, which beeps in recognition as though the beetles were so many cans of soup at the supermarket checkout counter.
Working out of their jungle lab at the La Selva Biological Station on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, these researchers are chipping away, one bug at a time, at the monumental task of inventorying every last species of creeping, crawling, flying, scuttling, teeming bug in this unthinkably diverse jungle.


Market Place; Trucks, rails and airlines of the Dow transports surge on the Fed cut.
THE stock market has seen the Federal Reserve cut rates, and it thinks that a recession will be avoided.
In the last three sessions after the Fed's move on Thursday to reduce the Federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, stocks that are sensitive to the economy have performed much better than others.
The Dow Jones transportation average, which is very economically sensitive, has surged 7.3 percent over the last three sessions, the best move over such a period since late 1991.

Elephant Storms Out Of Circus in Queens
An irritable young elephant bumped into another elephant during a circus performance in a Queens park, then began fighting and stormed out of the tent, as audience members scrambled up the bleachers to flee the fracas, the authorities said.
About 12 people suffered minor injuries, though none were directly caused by the 15-year-old elephant, named Debbie, officials said.


All-Star Numbers Secondary to Ratings
Before gloom, doom, fog and brown tide swallow up major league baseball, let this be said: its All-Star Game outdraws those of all other sports.
There is still potency in one of the beleaguered sport's family jewels.
But how much of that power will be evident tonight during ABC's telecast?
Will the game's Nielsen rating approach last year's pre- strike 15.7?
Will it drop by as much as baseball's 20 percent attendance decline?
Will the relative meaninglessness of the midseason exhibition be rendered more meaningful than before?


Chess; Kasparov shows he can adjust to slow-motion maneuvering without losing his edge.
In the first round of the final two-game knockout match of the Intel World Chess Grand Prix in New York, Vasily Ivanchuk of Ukraine chose a conservative procedure to confront Gary Kasparov of Russia, one that would deny the Professional Chess Association's champion a quick-opening, sharp counterattack.
That was not a bad strategy, but it certainly was not foolproof: Kasparov won anyway.
The point is that although Kasparov attracts maximum attention with his scintillating attacks, he has as complete a game as Bobby Fischer had 23 years ago.
If the position calls for slow-motion tacking about, he will throw himself into it without losing patience or alertness.
A good example of this was his first game with Ivanchuk, played at the Tribeca Performing Arts Center on June 23.
Both this and the second game, which Kasparov also won, were contested at the quickplay time limit of 25 minutes for all moves.


Stocks Post Some Big Gains, but Dow Eases 0.34
A casual investor looking at just the Dow Jones industrial average might have assumed that the stock market was generally lackluster yesterday.
After all, the Dow eased fractionally at the close after completing its best week in about 11 months, topping both the 4,600 and the 4,700 levels.
But beneath the surface, there was quite a bit of rumbling in active trading.
Some stocks soared and others plummeted as traders moved their funds into groups that they considered undervalued.


Campaigns for Ford and Mercedes in Southern California seem to cover similar creative ground.
IMITATION in most other businesses is called plagiarism, copyright infringement or even intellectual property theft.
Litigation is usually not far behind.
In advertising, however, some form of imitation is sometimes inseparable from creativity.
Allusions to television, cinema and bygone ad campaigns are standard practice.
Copycat ads are typically shrugged off as coincidental by many in the industry but can still embarrass their creators when other ad agencies accuse them of plagiarism, or at least a lack of imagination.


Jordanian Gets 15 Years For Murdering His Wife
A man who strangled his wife in New Jersey was sentenced yesterday in his native Jordan to 15 years of prison and "hard labor." The term was much lighter than he would probably have received in the United States, American officials said, and it seemed to satisfy no one.
After the defendant, Mohammad I. Abequa, was sentenced in Amman, the prosecution and defense both said they would appeal.

In a Season of Discontent, Japan Hails a Conquering Hero
When Hideo Nomo, a star pitcher for Japan's Kintetsu Buffaloes, decided some months back to leave his team and try to make it in the American major leagues, he was regarded by some people here as almost a traitor to Japanese baseball.
But when Hideo Nomo, Los Angeles Dodger and National League strikeout king, takes the mound as his league's starting pitcher in Tuesday's All-Star Game, his countrymen back home will be rooting for him as a new hero.
For by leaving Japan and showing that a Japanese player can succeed in America, Nomo has given a bigger boost to the reputation of Japanese baseball than he ever could have done by staying.


Region News Briefs; Wall Street Brokerage Is Told to Repay Temple
A Wall Street brokerage firm was ordered today to repay a Mamaroneck synagogue that lost more than $600,000 by investing in high-risk securities.
The ruling, by an arbitration panel of the New York Stock Exchange, upheld a complaint by the Westchester Jewish Center that the brokerage firm of Gruntal &amp; Company had misled the synagogue's treasurer about the level of risk involved in the investment.
The panel said that Gruntal &amp; Company must refund $630,000 to the congregation and pay the synagogue's legal fees of $50,000.


From Vacant to Vegetables


A Continent in Excerpts, From Afrobeat to Wails
With five bands from Africa and one from Haiti, the Africa Fete on Saturday and Sunday afternoon at Central Park's Summerstage tried to represent not only musicians born in Africa but also the diaspora.
That's a vast territory, especially since Africa accounts for 10 percent of the world's population.
One result of this was a multiplicity of styles and viewpoints, with traditional Malian music following a rollicking Zairian pop hybrid, with messages about living for today preceding warnings to think about tomorrow.
Featuring Femi Kuti of Nigeria, Osibisa of Ghana (by way of Britain), Baaba Maal of Senegal, Oumou Sangare of Mali, Tabu Ley Rochereau of Zaire and Boukman Eksperyans of Haiti, the Africa Fete was a superstar event like few others.
Perhaps in future years Western ears, now open to international sounds, will be discriminating enough to want a Malian Fete or a Zairian Fete.


International Briefs; Cutback at ABN-Amro
ABN-Amro Holding N.V., the largest bank in the Netherlands, plans to eliminate about 840 jobs at its head office in Amsterdam in the next four years, a spokesman said yesterday.
The bank, which has about 8,400 employees at the office, said the cuts were part of a plan to increase efficiency.
Jules Prast, chief spokesman for ABN-Amro, said the reduction was part of a job-cutting program instituted shortly after the 1990 merger of ABN and Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank. (Bloomberg Business News)


Archer Official Taped Talks for F.B.I.
Federal investigators used a senior executive of the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company to secretly tape- record conversations with other executives and companies as part of an expanding investigation into possible price collusion on several of the company's products, an official at the company said today.
The tapes, made over the last three years by Mark E. Whitacre, a biochemist who heads Archer's BioProducts division, were played in recent days to other employees being questioned by investigators.


Back in Fashion, Video Installations
Video art, which in its brief history has gone in and out of art-world fashion more than once, seems to be on something of a roll this summer.
Bill Viola, a star of the medium, is representing the United States at the Venice Biennale; Gary Hill, another prime figure, is the subject of a retrospective at the Guggenheim SoHo, and recent gallery shows in New York City have featured installations by Nam June Paik and Mary Lucier, two video stalwarts.
Now the Museum of Modern Art gives a further boost to the video boom with "Video Spaces: Eight Installations," which runs through Sept. 12.
Organized by Barbara London, head of the museum's video program, the show features recent works by Mr.
Viola, Chris Marker, Gary Hill, Judith Barry and Brad Miskell, Teiji Furuhashi, Tony Oursler, Stan Douglas and Marcel Odenbach.

An article yesterday about documents removed from the office of the former White House counsel, Vincent W. Foster Jr., after he died, misstated the position taken by Robert B. Fiske Jr., the former Whitewater independent counsel, on the handling of the documents.
Before leaving office, Mr.

Campbell Plans A Consolidation
The Campbell Soup Company said yesterday that it would consolidate its global account, with billings estimated at $200 million, at three or four agencies from the eight now on its roster.
The review involves all Campbell brands, including Campbell's, Godiva chocolates, Mrs.
Paul's frozen fish, Pepperidge Farm baked goods, Prego spaghetti sauces, Swanson TV dinners and Vlasic pickles.
"We are taking a look at what makes sense for Campbell in terms of aligning our agencies on a global basis," Gary Moss, vice president for global advertising at Campbell in Camden, N.J., said, confirming a report this week in Adweek.


Republican Letter Criticized on Racial and Ethnic Grounds
A new fund-raising letter for Congressional Republicans features a "Wanted" poster that is intended to help unseat 28 liberal Democrats, 22 of whom are black, Hispanic, female or Jewish.
The Democrats said today that the poster was "the latest example of Republican efforts" to fan the flames of racial and ethnic hatred.
The Republicans said that they wanted to unseat liberals, that it was little surprise that many of them would include minorities or women and that they had no intention of highlighting anything but the lawmakers' voting records.


CHRONICLE
The Rolling Stones don't reach quite so far back into musical history as Irving Berlin, but there were kindly jokes about their advancing ages on Sunday at their first live concert in Britain in five years.
Reuters reported that there was also discussion as to whether this might be their last tour and that there had been calls for Queen Elizabeth to knight them.
Clearly reveling in his return to Britain, MICK JAGGER, 51 and twice a grandfather, took to the stage in front of 50,000 fans at Sheffield in central England, as part of the band's worldwide Voodoo Lounge tour, billed as the biggest in rock-and-roll history.


CLINTON TAKES ON VIOLENT TELEVISION
President Clinton campaigned today in the heart of Tennessee for civic values, endorsing Congressional proposals to require television makers to install a computer chip that could automatically screen out programs that broadcasters had coded as violent.
"The question is how can we get beyond telling parents to do something that they physically cannot do for several hours a day unless they literally do want to be a home without a television or monitor their kids in some other way," Mr.
Clinton said at a conference here on the family and the media that was organized by Vice President Al Gore.
"This is not censorship, this is parental responsibility."


Habeas Corpus Aids Guilty and Innocent Both
To the Editor:
President Clinton's support for a narrower writ of habeas corpus for prisoners is misdirected, but not for the reasons relied on by Anthony Lewis (column, July 7).
By referring to habeas corpus as a remedy against confessions under torture, and to its role in protecting "law-abiding citizens," Mr.
Lewis suggests that it is or should be limited to inaccurate convictions.
This is false to the purpose of the writ, which strikes at all unconstitutional detentions -- even of the guilty.
Mr.
Lewis fails to note that the Supreme Court already prevents litigators from wasting the Federal courts' time.
State prisoners must first present claims to state courts and may not pepper Federal courts with a claim twice.
"Frivolous" claims may be dismissed out of hand.
Mr.
Lewis is correct that the hoopla over habeas is unique to death-penalty cases, where only a perverse culture would feel injured by a prisoner who invokes process to save his life.

Genentech Ousts Chief Over a Loan Guarantee Bid
Genentech Inc. said today that its board had ousted G. Kirk Raab as president and chief executive after the disclosure that he had sought a personal loan guarantee of $2 million from the company's majority stockholder, Roche Holdings Ltd. of Switzerland, while the companies were in merger negotiations earlier this year.
Genentech, a biotechnology company based in South San Francisco, Calif., said Arthur D. Levinson, who has been a senior vice president and the company's chief scientist, would succeed Mr.
Raab, who is 60.
The company said Dr.
Levinson, who is 45, was appointed on Friday, after the board asked for and received Mr.
Raab's resignation.


We Can't Re-establish Vietnam Relations
To the Editor:
The United States has never had diplomatic relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam or its antecedents.
It is therefore incorrect to state as you do that "President Clinton has concluded that the time has come to re-establish full diplomatic relations with the former enemy" (front page, July 7).
The United States did not recognize the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam when it was established by Ho Chi Minh in Hanoi in September 1945.
When the Soviet Union and China recognized this government in February 1950, President Truman recognized the Government of the State of Vietnam headed by former Emperor Bao Dai.


METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK'S BOND RATING IS LOWERED
A major credit agency lowered its rating of New York City's long-term credit worthiness, citing both the sluggish economy and fiscal gimmicks it said were used by Mayor to balance the city's budget.
The decision by Standard &amp; Poor's cut the city's rating from A-, where it has been since 1987, to BBB+.  [ Page A1. ]
For months, the Giuliani administration watched as the downgrading of New York City's credit rating approached like a slow-moving but inexorable train.
After the train had struck and moved on, the question around City Hall was whether the Mayor might have done anything to move out of the way.

MOBSTER PORTRAYAL STIRS DISBELIEF
A Federal indictment last month depicted Paul H. K. Lai, a well-known Chinatown businessman, as a top leader of an organized crime group that law-enforcement officials believe has begun to rival the Mafia in influence and brutality -- a man who cold-bloodedly ordered murders to protect his gambling and extortion rackets.
But many in Chinatown, and Mr.
Lai himself in an unusual two-hour interview, describe him as a classic immigrant success story, an honorable businessman and benevolent civic leader who even served on an advisory panel for Gov.

CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES UPHELD
Upholding New Jersey's child-support guidelines, the state Supreme Court rejected a divorced father's arguments that his support payments should be reduced so he can spend the money as he sees fit when he is caring for his children.
The decision, in a case involving James Pascale, a divorced father of three who pays $1,150 a month in child support, overturns a ruling by a state Appellate Court.
More broadly, it runs counter to a trend in other jurisdictions to develop equations for child support.  [ A1. ]
In what Federal officials suggested could be the last big infusion of homeless-assistance money for years to come, the Government awarded New York City $100 million for emergency shelter, permanent housing, drug treatment and day care.  [ B3. ]
ORTHODOX JUDGES OVERTURN BETROTHAL
First, Sarah Leah Goldstein was ambushed by a biblical passage that had been ignored for centuries.
Then she was saved by a voice from beyond the grave.
A special assembly of Orthodox Jewish religious judges declared that Miss Goldstein, whose father betrothed her at age 11 to a man whose identity he would not reveal, was free to marry anyone she pleased.  [ B3. ] ROUGH START FOR NEW D.M.V.

Why Child Care Isn't Like Baby Sitting

New Attack Planned On Ills of Space Travel
A CONUNDRUM of the space age is that humans have spent a great deal of time in orbit yet understand little about how to prevent the ills that bedevil space travelers, a prerequisite if people one day are to trek to distant planets and stars.
More than 300 American and Russian astronauts have logged a total of 38 years in space since Yuri A. Gagarin in 1961 became the first person to ride a rocket into orbit.
Yet at best scientists have only sketchy insights into the causes and cures of such space ailments as nausea, anemia, lethargy, headaches, disorientation, fatigue, depression, motion sickness, heart palpitations, weakened defenses against infectious disease and losses of blood volume, muscle mass and bone.


Truck Drivers Killed in Collision
Two truck drivers were killed yesterday when their tractor-trailers collided during rush hour in the southbound lanes of Routes 1 and 9.
One of the trucks, apparently carrying a load of gasoline, burst into flames, sending thick black smoke hundreds of feet into the air, said the Linden Police Captain, Michael Boyle.


Representative Johnson's Ethics Task
At last, Representative Nancy Johnson of Connecticut has taken a tentative step toward discharging her duty as chairwoman of the House ethics committee.
The committee will hear testimony about Speaker Newt Gingrich's book deal with a publishing firm controlled by Rupert Murdoch.
But the committee's plan to take the testimony in closed session is hardly a way to reassure a properly skeptical public about its dedication to get to the bottom of things.
Mr.
Gingrich says he has no problem testifying in public.
He should demand that the hearing be open.


CHRONICLE
Must be something in the genes: There's nothing surprising about the notion that at least one of Irving Berlin's descendants might go into show business, but it was not always inevitable for the one who did, his granddaughter MARY ELLIN LERNER.
It just took a while.
Ms.
Lerner, 38, intended to be a jazz musician when she studied music, voice and theater at Tufts University, but she said that when she graduated in 1978, "I couldn't figure out exactly how to do that." She added, "I had also been an English major and could see a path into writing more clearly." So she veered off into Columbia Journalism School and then to writing jobs on Mademoiselle, Family Weekly and other magazines.


Nebraska Decides to Shuck the Corn
Forget Cornhuskers; Huskers is the new selling point for Nebraska athletic officials.
The Cornhuskers nickname, begun in 1902, seems, well, corny, to too many football recruits.
Huskers, however, was just fine, so officials have been cutting the corn from printed materials and logos.
"We've found that Cornhuskers and Herbie, the mascot, just don't sell outside of Nebraska," Athletic Director BILL BYRNE said. (AP)

International Briefs; Two Deals for Thorn
Thorn EMI P.L.C., the British music and rentals company, said yesterday that it would pay $106 million to buy the Advantage Companies and the Tidewater Rental Corporation, operators of its United States Rent-A-Center franchises.
Thorn said it would pay $18.50 a share to acquire Advantage, based in Wichita, Kan., and its two subsidiaries, Comcoa Inc. and Advantedge Rental Purchase Inc.
In addition, Thorn said it had agreed to purchase Tidewater Rental, a privately held company associated with Advantage, for an undisclosed sum.
Tidewater operates 20 Rent-A-Center franchises in Virginia. (Bloomberg Business News)

For a Veteran Traveler, Jupiter Is Within Reach
THE Galileo spacecraft has seemed to take forever to reach Jupiter.
The mission, authorized by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1979, ran into many technical and budgetary delays, and was finally launched from a space shuttle in October 1989.
Since then the spacecraft has traveled 2.3 billion miles on a roundabout course to Jupiter.


Nevitt Sanford, 86, Psychologist Who Traced Roots of Prejudice
Nevitt Sanford, a psychologist whose response to the rise of the Nazis was to develop scientific methods to study prejudice and hatred, died on Friday in a nursing home in Belfast, Me.
He was 86.
The cause was a heart attack while being treated for a broken hip, said his daughter Jane Sanford of Belfast.


Cordiant Seen Naming Chief Today
Cordiant P.L.C. in London is expected to announce the appointment of a new chief executive today to succeed Charles Scott, who is expected to be named chairman of the agency company.
The announcement would end a lengthy search for a new leader for Cordiant, formerly the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Company, which has been battered by account losses and personnel defections since Maurice Saatchi, its former chairman, was ousted in December.
Mr.
Scott has been serving as acting chairman as well as chief executive; he said last month that he would become chairman if the company was to hire a new chief executive.

From the Yearbook Incident to the 'Boot Camp' Parade
THE five Greenwich High School seniors went into deep seclusion last month after news broke that they had slipped a coded message of racial hate into the school yearbook.
Reporters searched all over Greenwich for them, camping outside their homes, knocking on the doors of their neighbors and phoning their relatives.
But the teen-agers were nowhere to be found.
Then, as part of their punishment, they were put in Roy Innis's hands.


Luring Children Into Evil
Benjamin Britten's landmark 1954 chamber opera "The Turn of the Screw" is difficult to bring off.
The story, adapted from the Henry James novella by the librettist Myfanwy Piper, is intricately bound to its setting, a rural country house in Victorian England.
Yet this tale of two children, their absentee guardian, the governess and housekeeper who raise them, and the dead manservant and schoolmistress who come back to lure them into wickedness, is a profoundly ambiguous work.
Britten's music, which quivers with murkiness, utterly captures this ambiguity.
"The Turn of the Screw" does not get produced that often, let alone in a production as musically strong and dramatically convincing as the current one by the Opera Festival of New Jersey in Lawrenceville.
Michael Pratt, the music director of the festival, conducted a vibrant, nuanced and rhythmically incisive performance of Britten's elusive music, imaginatively scored for just 13 instruments.
Britten daringly juxtaposes music of contrasting styles: skittish 12-tone motives are anchored by tonally clear but shifting harmonies; outpourings of plaintive vocal arioso are interrupted by eerie, almost Minimalistic repetitions of simple accompaniment patterns.


Mexico Sells Notes Totaling $1 Billion
For the first time since the start of its current economic crisis, the Government of Mexico successfully re-entered the international credit market today, selling $1 billion in two-year notes to more than two dozen commercial banks.
The Government had originally offered $500 million of the notes but the banks were willing to buy as many as $1.6 billion worth, according to Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz.
Mr.
Ortiz said the Government decided to limit the offer to $1 billion and that at some point it would attempt other offers, perhaps with longer maturities and smaller premiums.


Baseball's Rebirth Is All-Star Mission
Hideo Nomo could not hide today because everyone from former All-Stars to current All-Stars wanted his autograph, and everyone from old reporters to young photographers wanted more of his time.
Nomo kept bowing, smiling and shaking his head in amazement and amusement at the attention.
Randy Johnson could not hide either because he is 6 feet 10 inches and has a skinny left arm that whizzes a ball 98 miles an hour.
He had to crouch to greet the microphones thrust before him, but he did not smile as often as Nomo.
Still, Johnson was more comfortable because he was not answering questions in Japanese.


Protestants Fight Police In Ulster
Several thousand Protestant demonstrators clashed with the Northern Ireland police tonight after the police had refused for a day-and-a-half to allow the Protestants to march through a Roman Catholic area in the town of Portadown, 25 miles west of Belfast.
The demonstrators threw rocks at the 1,000 members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the overwhelmingly Protestant security force in this British province, and the police responded by firing plastic bullets.
Several injuries were reported as some of the demonstrators briefly broke through police lines in an attempt to reach the Catholic area.
No clashes were reported between Protestant demonstrators and the Catholics who had blocked their way, with police support, on Sunday.


Greenspan's Error
The Fed's reduction of one set of interest rates on Friday marked the beginning of the end of Alan Greenspan's war on inflation.
The war began in February 1994 with the Fed's quarter point increase in the rates that banks charge one another for overnight loans and led to a doubling of those rates, to 6 percent from 3 percent.
The financial markets expect further cuts.
The war was phony.
So was the enemy.
Despite nonstop fretting by Mr.
Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, no serious evidence of accelerating inflation ever emerged.
For the first five months of 1995, consumer prices rose at a very modest 3.6 percent annual rate.


U.S. Awards $100 Million To Assist Homeless
In what Federal officials suggested could be the last big infusion of homeless-assistance money for years to come, the Government yesterday awarded New York City $100 million for emergency shelter, permanent housing, drug treatment and day care.
In making the announcement at City Hall yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the grant would be shared by 70 not-for-profit housing and social service organizations and some city agencies, including the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.


Ritts Is TV Repairman for L.P.G.A.
When the Ladies Professional Golf Association announced last month that its search for a new commissioner was complete, the immediate reaction in the golf world was "who?" When the new commissioner was identified as Jim Ritts, the ensuing reaction was "who??!!"
Within golf's clubby confines, where everyone who is anyone shows up under the oak tree at Augusta National each spring, Ritts was an unknown.
So, when the 41-year-old television marketing whiz was named to succeed Charles Mechem, most golf folks were more than surprised.
Stunned would be more like it.


Spasm of Violence Is Shaking a Poor Mexican State
Their names are crudely scratched into the still-wet concrete of their tomb -- Rafael, Carmina, Santos, Sergio, Javier, Luis, Candido, Andres.
There are four more graves of the extended Salgado family back in the mountains.
The graves here on a high bluff near the muddy Balsas River are just some of the signs of a recent spasm of violence in Guerrero, which for centuries has been one of Mexico's poorest and most rebellious states.
Even though people here have grown accustomed to violence, this newest wave of killings has left them shaken.


Devils Seem Close to Deal Keeping Them in Jersey
Nashville is fading fast as the potential future home of the New Jersey Devils.
The Devils and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the team's landlord, are close to reaching an agreement that will keep the National Hockey League champions playing at Byrne Meadowlands Arena, two persons with knowledge of the talks said yesterday.
Officials from both sides met yesterday, starting at 9 A.M.
But John Samerjan, an authority spokesman, last night dismissed speculation that a deal was done.
"They're way ahead of themselves if they're saying that," he said.
However, a third person familiar with the negotiations provided a broad outline of a proposed agreement on a renegotiated long-term lease.
It would not, the person said, include taxpayer money.
Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman, whose husband, John, helped bring the two once-feuding parties together, vowed not to permit tax dollars to be part of a save-the-Devils deal.
But she had also promised to do whatever was necessary to avoid being tarred as the Governor who let the champions leave.
The deal would also include the addition of more high-priced club seats and luxury suites to satisfy the Devils' demands for more revenue at the arena, and an increase in what the Devils get from concessions and parking.
The team now gets 34.2 percent of gross revenue from luxury suites, concessions and parking; that is considered low by industry standards but more than what is received by the Nets, the Devils' co-tenant at the arena.
The arena has 29 luxury suites and can accommodate at least 40 more.
But the agreement will not allow the Devils to run the arena, as John McMullen, the team's owner, has wanted to do for many years.
McMullen claims that the Devils lost $2 million during the past season, adding to an $18 million accumulated debt since he acquired the team in 1982.
He has flirted with moving to Nashville, where officials are offering to let him keep a $20 million relocation bonus, 97.5 percent of luxury suite sales and one-third of year-end profits at a new arena under construction.
The most palpable sign that negotiations were advancing came yesterday when the Devils and the authority agreed to postpone a hearing scheduled for this morning in Hackensack, N.J., before Superior Court Judge Peter Ciolino into the authority's request for a temporary restraining order to keep the team from terminating its lease.
On June 27, the Devils said they would terminate their lease on July 6.
"I think this is positive, but you never know what's for certain until this is concluded," said Alan Berman, a lawyer representing the Devils in talks with the authority.
Both sides adjourned a similar hearing last Monday.
"They're still negotiating," Berman added.
McMullen and Robert Mulcahy, the authority's president, accompanied the Devils yesterday to the White House for a Rose Garden ceremony honoring the Stanley Cup champions.
But Lou Lamoriello, the team's president and general manager, remained behind all day to negotiate.
A deal, if concluded, would be a major breakthrough in the stormy relationship between the long-squabbling team and authority, which two weeks ago exchanged nasty allegations of deceit and bad-faith negotiations.
The team said the authority had defaulted on its lease 13 different ways; the authority said the charges were concocted in an attempt to pack up for Nashville.
The drama over the Devils' future competed with the compelling story of their drive for their first-ever N.H.L. championship, which they achieved with a four-game sweep of the Detroit Red Wings.
Would the former Colorado Rockies finally reach glory, only to be lured away by Tennessee with promises of untold wealth?
The long-contentious relationship between the team and the authority grew even worse, when, on the day the Devils won the title, they sent the authority notice that they would terminate their lease after the 1996-97 season.
Then, on June 27, one day before a parade at the arena to celebrate winning the Stanley Cup, the team told the authority that it would terminate its lease on July 6.
But the recent tension in this landlord-tenant dispute was the outgrowth of a long-simmering feud that had been growing nasty since last December, when the authority suspended the team's lease during the N.H.L. lockout.
The authority called it a technicality that was negated when the season began.
However, the team charged that the lease suspension was an attempt to deprive the team of its share of luxury suite revenue from non-hockey events.
That incident triggered the Devils' demand for an audit of authority finances to discover whether other revenues had been withheld over the past 13 years.
The Devils claimed that at least $11 million had been held back, and charged the authority with being uncooperative in the audit.


Politics Aside, Many in China Are Expanding Business With Taiwan
As relations between the United States and China worsen, barely a day goes by without a Chinese leader spewing invective about Taiwan and how Washington treats it.
But away from China's diplomatic huffing and puffing, senior and mid-level officials who grapple with how to modernize China's economy are steadily expanding business ties with Taiwan, the island nation that is increasingly seen by mainlanders as a model for how to do business more efficiently and profitably.


Unreasonable in the Age of Reason
THE FEMALE THERMOMETER  18th-Century Culture and the Invention of the Uncanny
By Terry Castle
Illustrated. 278 pages. Oxford University Press. Cloth, $35; paper, $15.95.
All eras have their popular stereotypes, and in the case of the 18th century, we think immediately of the Enlightenment with its devotion to scientific rationalism, its belief in pragmatism and progress.
But in much the same way that historians like Peter Gay and Steven Marcus have debunked Victorian stereotypes of repression and stuffy propriety, so other historians and critics have worked to strip the 18th century of its self-confident and simplistic image as the Age of Reason.
The latest among these efforts is Terry Castle's lively new study of 18th-century culture, "The Female Thermometer."


Subway Crews Spend Night Cleaning Water Main Mess
Working through the night after Sunday's huge water main break, city workers pumped out water, scooped out muck, hosed down subway cars and dried off subway rails, managing to get subway service back in time for yesterday morning's rush hour.
Officials said yesterday that they still did not know what caused the 93-year-old pipe to rupture south of Times Square just before dawn Sunday.
They said that while water-main breaks were common in a system as vast and old as New York's, Sunday's rupture was unusual because it happened in a very large pipe and occurred in the summer, instead of in cold weather, when main breaks are more prevalent.


Open Invitation To Make Pitch For Tax Breaks
For lawmakers and lobbyists looking for tax breaks, this is the time to be heard.
The House Ways and Means Committee today held the first of two days of hearings about what are euphemistically called "miscellaneous tax reforms." These involve small changes in the tax law that would mean big savings for particular companies, industries and individuals.


Tax Collection Up in Jersey City
The property-tax collection rate in Jersey City is at its highest level since 1958, a spokesman for Mayor Bret Schundler announced yesterday.
City officials say the rate for the fiscal year that ended June 30 was 94.2 percent.
Part of the credit, they say, goes to the city's aggressive marketing of tax liens to investors who pay off overdue taxes and then collect up to 18 percent interest from delinquent property owners.
When Mayor Schundler took office in 1992, his spokesman said, the collection rate stood at 82.8 percent.


New York's Haunted Houses
Gov.
George Pataki of New York is expected to sign a bill that will please real estate agents, stifle writers of horror stories and shed light on a strange current of medieval thought that has never been purged from the American psyche.
The legislation, passed by the State Senate and Assembly, would exempt realtors from having to disclose if a property they are selling has a stigma, that is, if it is haunted or if some ghastly catastrophe -- a suicide or gruesome murder -- has ever occurred there.

The verdict amounted to a loud wake-up call for the hotel industry.

N.A.A.C.P. Faces Squabble About Its Road to the Future
The 86th annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is in town, and for the past couple of days this has not been a good place to be named Newt, Clarence or Rush.
The icons of the American Right have been ridiculed, scorned and mocked by the more than 2,000 convention delegates during the five-day gathering that began on Saturday and is to end on Thursday.


Eating Well
THE Department of Agriculture kicked off its new school lunch program last month in Washington with a carnival, banners, speeches and games -- and lunch created by several award-winning chefs.
The event was part of the Team Nutrition program, a broad effort to educate children about the importance of a good diet, and the department's campaign to prove that it's possible to serve good-tasting and healthful food to children in school cafeterias and still stay within lunch budgets.
As always, the trick will be getting the children to eat the food.


Maryland Passer Suspended
Maryland quarterback SCOTT MILANOVICH, the most prolific passer in school history, has been suspended for eight games by the National Collegiate Athletic Association for gambling on college sports, The Associated Press reported, citing unidentified sources.
The penalty, the most severe handed to a Division I athlete for such a violation, is all because of a handful of bets reportedly totaling $200.


U.S. Tells How It Cracked Code of A-Bomb Spy Ring
The American intelligence establishment today unveiled one of its oldest secrets: how a small team of code-breakers found the first clues that the Soviet Union sought to steal the blueprints for the atomic bomb in World War II.
Using just brain power -- no computers, no stolen skeleton keys -- the cryptographers slowly cracked what was thought to be an unbreakable code.
They painstakingly turned gibberish into powerful evidence of a Soviet spy ring whose ranks included Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.


Salomon Says It Will Report Another Loss
Does the bad news ever stop?
Salomon Inc. unexpectedly warned yesterday that it would report a loss of approximately $65 million in the second quarter because of reversals in trading for its own account and at its Phibro commodity business.
The loss, at an investment firm already shaken by defections of more than 30 managing directors in the last few months, put a question mark over the survival of the company's top management -- in particular, Deryck C. Maughan, chairman and chief executive of Salomon Brothers Inc., the company's brokerage unit.

With New Genentech Chief, Science Takes Center Stage
Early in his 15-year career as a scientist at Genentech Inc., Arthur D. Levinson began asking for, and receiving, management responsibilities.
On Monday, he got more than he might have ever asked for when he was named president and chief executive, following the ouster of G. Kirk Raab.
Mr.
Raab was asked to step down on Monday following the disclosure that he sought a personal loan guarantee of $2 million from the company's majority shareholder, Roche Holding Ltd., while negotiating the sale of the balance of Genentech to Roche.
A former marketing executive with Abbott Laboratories, Mr.
Raab made Genentech as well known for its aggressive sales practices -- some of which resulted in legal inquiries -- as for leading-edge biotechnology.


Accounts of Violence by Paramilitary Groups
A month after members of right-wing paramilitary organizations told a Senate subcommittee that they were ordinary, law-abiding citizens who only owned guns to protect themselves, a group of local, state and Federal officials today told other lawmakers that similar groups had assaulted, harassed and threatened them, members of their families and co-workers.
Appearing before seven House Democrats at an informal hearing, witnesses described an escalation of intimidation and violence by members of self-styled militias, white supremacists and other fringe groups like the Freemen, Wise Users, and Constitutionalists, whose profound dislike of government and regulations shape their political agendas.


AT WORK WITH: Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper; The Fit Commandment
TO eat lunch with Dr.
Kenneth H. Cooper, whose 1968 book, "Aerobics," helped start the fitness movement, is intellectually provocative but hardly sensuous.
Dr.
Cooper, who has written 10 books, more than 10 million of which are in print in the United States alone, eats the way he exercises -- with the strictest discipline.
It was 2 in the afternoon, lunchtime at the 30-acre Cooper Aerobics Center in Dallas, which includes a clinic, a health club, a hotel and the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research.
At the cafeteria, Dr.
Cooper chose the same lunch he has every day: a cup (not even a bowl) of soup, salt-free crackers and unsweetened iced tea. (Prisoners probably have more variety.)

Keycorp Reviews Corporate Account
Keycorp, the banking and financial services company, is seeking an agency to handle its corporate branding account, which is now handled by various agencies on a project-by-project basis.
Though the billings were not disclosed, Adweek estimated them at $40 million.
John Fuller, a Keycorp spokesman in Cleveland, confirmed a report of the review this week in Adweek.
He said Monday that the Advertising Agency Register in New York had been hired to help manage the review.
A decision is expected at the end of September, he added.


Batter Up in Atlantic City
The State Casino Reinvestment Development Authority agreed yesterday to provide $9 million for a minor league baseball stadium at Bader Field, the airport in Atlantic City, and $30 million for a 500-room hotel to be linked by a pedestrian walkway to a new convention center that is now under construction.


The Mystical, With Passions Running High
Opera Manhattan's mission is the presentation of rarely heard if not quite unknown works, mostly from the French repertory.
But instead of presenting a complete work in its current run, which opened on Monday evening at St.
Peter's Church and closes tomorrow, the company is offering a survey of its recent finds in "Myths and Immortality," a program that includes the first act of Alberic Magnard's "Guercoeur," a scene from the middle of Ernest Chausson's "Roi Arthus" and the finale of Ernest Reyer's "Sigurd."
Passions run high in these late Romantic works, and so does the level of mystical and poetic discourse.
In "Guercoeur," the noble title character, having triumphed over tyranny and expecting to spend blissful days with his wife, Giselle, and his comrade Heurtal, has suddenly died.
But Paradise and its delegation of Goddesses have no appeal for him: he persuades them to let him live as a mortal one day longer.


Two Inmates to a Cell Defies Health Standards
To the Editor:
The decision to double up inmates in cells in New York State prisons is a mistake (news article, July 8).
In the long run it will prove costly.


Defense Team For Simpson Attacks Time Of Dog's Cry
Lawyers for O. J. Simpson began chipping away at the prosecution's time line today, bringing in several witnesses to say that all was calm and eerily quiet outside Nicole Brown Simpson's condominium at the moment prosecutors say Mrs.
Simpson's dog was howling over the bodies of its owner and her friend.
Danny Mandel and Ellen Aaronson, young entertainment industry employees on a blind date, testified that their walk through the misty Brentwood neighborhood on June 12, 1994, from the Mezzaluna restaurant to Ms.
Aaronson's apartment, took them past Mrs.
Simpson's home at 875 South Bundy Drive around 10:25 P.M.
There, they testified, they saw nothing unusual, like bloody paw prints, nor heard anything unusual, like people scuffling or dogs wailing.


Yeltsin Taken To Hospital Suffering Heart Pain
President Boris N. Yeltsin, whose visibly declining health has long provoked speculation here, was rushed to the hospital today with what his press service described as "acute" heart pains.
Within hours the Kremlin began issuing statements saying that the 64-year-old President was "fully in control," that he would continue with his work while in the hospital, and that his pains had subsided.


World News Briefs; U.N., Doubting Iraq, Declines to Lift Sanctions
Expressing unanimous doubt that Iraq has come clean about its program to develop biological weapons, the Security Council declined today to lift the economic sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait nearly five years ago.
Gerardo Martinez Blanco of Honduras, the chairman of the Security Council this month, said there have been "no changes" in the sanctions imposed on Iraq in August 1990.
Some other members of the Security Council expressed skepticism that Iraq would clear up enough questions to justify lifting sanctions when the next review comes due in September.


Market Place; A fledgling restaurant chain cashes in on the brew pub trend.
SOME investors are betting that small breweries have a future, and one company they have focused on is Rock Bottom Restaurants Inc. of Boulder, Colo.
Analysts say it is the leading contender to build a national chain of brew pubs.
The United States once had hundreds of local brewers practicing a rich tradition but their number had dried up to 60 by 1980, according to the Institute for Brewing Studies.
Now, a renaissance is in full swing, the trade group says, with local brews on tap at 658 microbreweries and brew pub restaurants, which serve proprietary beers.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; After the Saatchi storm, Cordiant hires 'someone who has been a demanding client himself.'
CORDIANT P.L.C., beset by difficulties since the stormy departures of the founding Saatchi brothers, is seeking to reverse its flagging fortunes by hiring a consumer marketing specialist who has never met -- and doesn't know -- either Saatchi.
Cordiant, the world's fifth-largest agency company, with $11 billion in billings, said yesterday in London that Robert L. Seelert would become chief executive, effective immediately.
Mr.
Seelert, 52, who formerly led companies that market brands from Maxwell House coffee to No Nonsense hosiery, will oversee operations that include the Bates Worldwide and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide agencies.


Man Arrested in Drive-by Death
A 20-year-old Freehold man has been arrested and charged with the murder of a 4-year-old girl in what the police said was the first drive-by shooting in Asbury Park.
Evonia Kettles was sitting on the windowsill of her grandmother's apartment Monday afternoon when she was struck in the chest by a bullet fired from a passing car.

National League Gets the Best of Home-Run Battle
Frank Thomas, the Chicago White Sox's burly slugger, won the All-Star Home Run Derby on Monday, but the National League ganged up on him tonight and won the All-Star Game.
After Thomas socked a two-run home run in the fourth inning, Craig Biggio, Mike Piazza and Jeff Conine hit bases-empty home runs, powering the Nationals to a 3-2 victory, the league's second straight after the American League had won six games in a row.

Future of U.N. Force In Bosnia Is in Doubt
The fall of Srebrenica has thrown the future of the United Nations mission in Bosnia into jeopardy, senior American and Western European officials said.
Military commanders expressed concern over heightened risks to United States and NATO forces by Bosnian Serbs emboldened by their victory.
And in Paris, President Jacques Chirac said that France would send troops to Srebrenica if the United Nations asked that the enclave be recaptured from Bosnian Serb forces.

Cancer Link Contradicted By New Hormone Study
Just one month after a study found that women who took hormone replacement therapy after menopause had an increased risk of breast cancer, another study has found no such effect.
The new study, being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, compared some 500 women aged 50 to 64 who had newly diagnosed breast cancer with a similar group of healthy women.
The authors found no link between use of the hormones and breast cancer.
In fact, they found that women who had used hormones for eight years or longer had, if anything, a lower risk of breast cancer than those who had never taken them.

Personal Health
CORONARY bypass surgery has given hundreds of thousands of Americans with atherosclerotic heart disease a new lease on life by circumventing badly diseased coronary arteries that are in effect heart attacks waiting to happen.
Now surgeons are turning their attention to another set of arteries that can become major killers: the carotid arteries, which run through the neck and supply oxygen-rich blood to the brain.
When the walls of the carotids become thickened and the passageways through which blood must flow are narrowed by fatty deposits, it takes but a small blood clot to cut off the blood supply to part of the brain, causing a stroke.
Stroke, which can result in severe and permanent disability, is the nation's third-leading cause of death, after heart disease and cancer.
Carotid artery disease is believed to be responsible for 20 percent to 30 percent of strokes.
It can be dangerous even for symptom-free people; each year 2 percent to 5 percent of those with serious carotid narrowing but no symptoms suffer strokes.


Law Journals Attack 'Shopping' of Manuscripts
Law professors know that to move into their profession's tenured ranks their work must be published in law journals, the more prestigious the better.

Now the good journals, tired of their stepping-stone status, are fighting back.
Their weapon?
Offers that come with short deadlines, after which they disappear.

Big Hurt's Bat Leaves A Lasting Impression
Frank Thomas left for the airport after hitting a two-run homer in the fourth inning tonight, and he must have placed the rest of the American League's touted offense in his suitcase.
Once Thomas departed, his teammates never scored again and the National League displayed power of its own by walloping three homers and rallying for a 3-2 victory.
While Thomas was flying from Dallas to Chicago because the White Sox have a workout Wednesday afternoon, the American League was fizzling and Manager Buck Showalter was scheming.
Showalter did not disguise how important it was for him to win this ballyhooed exhibition game, as he said it was even more important than returning every player to his team uninjured and even more important than playing both Rangers All-Stars.

Certainly improvement on last year's 55-58 record was expected.
But those hopes have given way to another bummer of a season.

BUDGET -- A House subcommittee approved a spending bill that provides $60.7 billion for next year, but cuts $9.3 billion from scores of programs dealing with health and safety, education, job training and assistance for the poor.

If approved by Congress, the action would essentially give Federal employees the same policies they had during the Reagan and Bush Administrations.


On Takeover Of Lilco, Ally Of Pataki Is On Other Side
Three weeks after the Pataki administration denounced a prominent Democrat's plan for a state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, a major Republican official and ally of the Governor today embraced that plan, saying it was the best he had seen for reducing the Island's high electricity rates.
Robert J. Gaffney, the Suffolk County Executive, told an Assembly committee hearing here that he agreed with most of the main elements of the takeover plan unveiled last month by Richard M. Kessel, the Democratic chairman of the Long Island Power Authority.
And Mr.
Gaffney urged his fellow Republican, Gov.
George E. Pataki, to at least devise an alternative proposal incorporating important aspects of the authority's plan.
"I believe the current LIPA proposal could work for Suffolk County," Mr.
Gaffney told the hearing at the State University of New York at Farmingdale, where the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, served as chairman.
"This Lilco takeover proposal is the benchmark by which I will measure any future proposal."
Mr.
Gaffney, a longtime critic of Lilco management who is up for re-election this fall, distanced himself from the position taken by the Pataki administration on the plan last month, when aides to the Governor derisively dismissed the authority's plan as "irresponsible" and "irrelevant." Since then, Mr.
Pataki's aides have said that the Governor is working on his own proposal for reducing electricity rates on Long Island but have declined to say what it entailed or when it might be unveiled.
Mr.
Kessel, primary author of the takeover plan, is a longtime ally of Mr.
Pataki's Democratic predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo.
Mr.
Pataki's support is considered crucial to a takeover.
Officials of the power authority say that without his endorsement, the power authority could not obtain financial backing from Wall Street for the buyout, which would be paid for with tax-exempt bonds.
Still, in the view of many politicians and others on Long Island, Mr.
Gaffney's public words of encouragement have given a political boost to both the takeover plan and the power authority, a lame-duck panel that is dominated by holdovers from the Cuomo administration.
The authority's board is to be replaced in September by an expanded and restructured panel whose members will largely be determined by Mr.
Pataki.
Political observers say that Mr.
Gaffney is walking a tightrope on the state takeover question, trying to appeal to voters on the issue of rate reduction but not embarrass the Governor.
Patrick V. Halpin, a Democrat and the Suffolk County Executive before Mr.
Gaffney defeated him four years ago, said the problem for the Republicans is that the takeover notion was first proposed last fall, by Governor Cuomo, and has since been championed by the lame-duck chairman of LIPA, Mr.
Kessel, who served as executive director of the state Consumer Protection Board under Mr.
Cuomo.
"Pataki's problem is he's not supporting this because Cuomo proposed this and now Kessel, as chairman of LIPA, is advancing it," said Mr.
Halpin, a cable television talk-show host.
"So Bob Gaffney has made the decision, 'I'm going to be on the side of lower electric rates.' "
Under the $9.2 billion takeover proposal, LIPA officials say they would buy Lilco stock for $17.50 a share and could, through a variety of financial savings that would accompany a public takeover, reduce Lilco's electric rates by 20 percent over the next three to five years.
In addition, LIPA officials said they had an agreement with a large private utility, which they declined to name, to run Lilco for an annual fee.
Suffolk County officials, in particular, are interested in the takeover plan, because the public acquisition of Lilco would relieve the county of what looms as a potentially devastating burden: the payment of hundreds of millions of dollars to the utility to settle the overassessment of taxes on the defunct Shoreham nuclear power plant.
Lilco has successfully sued to recover tax money it paid before the utility was forced to abandon the plant.
Under state law, a public takeover would erase that liability.
On Long Island, reaction to the proposal has been mixed.
Officials of the Long Island Association, the region's most influential business group, have criticized the plan, saying that, among other things, the proposal overstates the potential savings to ratepayers.
Lilco, meanwhile, has rejected the $17.50 a share offer -- last fall, Mr.
Cuomo had offered $21.50 -- but LIPA officials say they could make another offer.

As Usual, Serbs Call The Shots
After the collapse last month of United Nations attempts to protect Sarajevo, the fall today of the eastern Bosnian Muslim enclave of Srebrencia was a crippling blow to the peacekeeping mission, one that was clearly sought by the Bosnian Serbs.
The Serbian attack made several things clear.
The first was that if the Bosnian Government wants to resolve the Bosnian conflict by fighting, as it has suggested through an offensive around Sarajevo in the last month, then the Serbs will hit back where the Bosnian Army is most vulnerable -- in the surrounded eastern enclaves.

The rancorous divisions of the Vietnam War still ripple through the political life of the country 20 years after Saigon fell and the last American helicopters lifted off the embassy roof with desperate Vietnamese clinging to them.
Washington's motives for fighting in Vietnam were terribly flawed, and 58,000 Americans paid for the arrogance and ignorance with their lives.


METRO DIGEST
FEW CHARGES IN POLICE SPREE INQUIRY
After a two-month investigation into a drunken spree by New York City police officers through six Washington hotels, police officials said that no more than seven of the 942 officers in the capital at the time faced serious departmental charges.
The small number of officers identified stands in sharp contrast to initial reports from Washington, which indicated that dozens upon dozens of drunken New York officers were grabbing women, spraying fire extinguishers, pulling fire alarms and prancing about nude.  [ Page A1. ]


An Androgynous Salsa That Forgoes Formality
Albita Rodriguez, a young, Cuban-born singer, may be virtually unknown among fans of salsa, the music she sings, but she's no stranger to fashion magazines.
It's not hard to see why.
She counts Madonna as a fan.
She lives in Miami.
Though she comes from an exotic place, her androgynous looks are European, and therefore seem more mainstream than those of many performers from the Caribbean.
Ms.
Rodriguez, who opened for the singer Marc Anthony at S.O.B.'s on Monday night, sings regularly at Centro Vasco, a small club in Miami, and was recently signed by Crescent Moon, a record label owned by Gloria Estefan.
Her newest record, "No Se Parece a Nada" is clearly the product of a fashion-industry sensibility, along with designer clothes, designer haircut and a designer cover.
The package is one face of the new salsa, a face, in this case, that looks to everyone from Edith Piaf to Annie Lennox for its presentation and seems bent on attracting an audience beyond the Hispanic world.

U.S. GRANTS VIETNAM FULL TIES; TIME FOR HEALING, CLINTON SAYS
Saying the time was at hand to "bind up our own wounds," President Clinton today extended full diplomatic recognition to Vietnam 22 years after the American withdrawal from a bitterly divisive war that still scars the national psyche.
Mr.
Clinton, the one-time student protester who avoided serving in a war he once said he "opposed and despised," announced the normalization of relations in a brief ceremony in the East Room attended by military figures, the families of those still missing in action and members of Congress who were veterans of the war and prisoners of the Vietnamese.

Francis (Reds) Bagnell, 66, Star Of Penn's Single-Wing Offense
Francis (Reds) Bagnell, a one-time water boy for the University of Pennsylvania football team who went on to anchor its powerful single-wing offense from 1948 to 1950, died Monday at Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia.
He was 66.
The cause of death was heart failure, said a hospital spokesman.
With a shock of red hair that inspired his nickname and a fiery competitiveness distinguishing his play on the field, Bagnell was an explosive tailback who became the primary weapon in Penn's backfield.
In the single wing, the tailback received the hike and then had a number of options that included running, handing off or pitching the ball to another runner, and passing.
Playing out of this formation, Bagnell was a powerful runner both inside and outside, and was also an accurate passer.
During his senior season, 1950, he threw 88 passes without an interception.


Actor's Breathing and Speech Show Improvement, Doctor Says
Although the actor Christopher Reeve is able to perform only two movements -- shrugging his shoulders and turning his neck from side to side -- his chief physician said today that she was optimistic about his progress and hoped to wean him from a ventilator in a few months.
"We have done something fantastic," said Dr.
Marca Sipski, medical director of Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, where Mr.
Reeve arrived two weeks ago.
After a riding accident May 27 that damaged his spinal cord, Mr.
Reeve had not been able to breathe on his own, but now his respiratory muscles have begun to function, she said.

Foreign Affairs; Meddling For Peace
Strap on the electrodes and rev up the car battery.
It's time for President Clinton to administer another jolt of shock therapy to Britain's Prime Minister, John Major.
He's gone wobbly again on Northern Ireland.
The cease-fire in Northern Ireland is fast approaching its first anniversary, Sept. 1, and yet efforts to build on this longest pause to the fighting in Belfast for 25 years are totally stalled.
There is blame aplenty to go around, but clearly the strongest, most influential actor in this drama -- the British Government -- could do the most to get peace talks going now and instead is doing the least.
London is paralyzed by a deep ambivalence about dealing with the Irish Republican Army.
Even though it is ready in principle to negotiate with the Irish Catholic militants, the British Government seems to be looking for any excuse not to do so.


For Many of Those Who Fled Vietnam, a Day of Sadness, Anger and Hope
For Yen Do, editor of the largest Vietnamese-language daily in America, the establishment today of diplomatic relations between Hanoi and Washington marks the end of a half century of war that has tortured his nation and scattered two million of its people around the world.
It welcomes Vietnam into the community of nations, opens new possibilities for its economic development and may help efforts to foster democracy and human rights after 20 years of Communist rule, said Mr.
Yen, who edits Nguoi Viet Daily News here in the community known as Little Saigon, 30 miles south of Los Angeles.


Business Travel; A travel industry study shows it's best to keep on the move to avoid becoming a victim of crime.
MANY companies brief their employees about safety precautions while traveling.
But while tourists have been victims in a number of well-publicized brutal crimes in recent years, the rate of crime against adult American travelers is actually 40 percent less than the rate for Americans in general.
According to a recent report, for every 1,000 American adults, there were 213 crimes against their property or person in 1994.
In that same period, the rate for travelers, who were defined as someone more than 100 miles from home, was 127.8 crimes for every 1,000 travelers.
The data were weighted to account for the fact that Americans are at home more than they travel.

Travel Tales: 'What I Ate on My Summer Vacation'

Frustrated School Board Wages War on Tenure for Teachers
Over the last year, after school property taxes jumped nearly 30 percent, financially troubled blue-collar voters here in the Patchogue-Medford school district elected a new school board that has created a furor by calling for an end to job tenure for teachers.
The new board, whose six members all belong to a conservative taxpayers' party, locked horns with the teachers' union even before the incoming members took control, arguing that the tenure system is too costly, protects incompetence and should be eliminated.

TV Power to the Parents
President Clinton has embraced a simple but promising measure to empower parents to screen out violence from the television programs their children can watch at home.
The proposal, part of the Senate-passed telecommunications bill, requires television makers to install a computer chip that lets parents block out programs that are rated violent.
The chip-and-rating system could offer an elegant way to let parents impose their own viewing values without raising the menace of Government-imposed censorship.
But that can only happen if the bill is amended to keep the Government entirely out of the ratings effort.
Under the bill, the television industry would develop its own rating codes, similar to movie ratings devised by the film industry.
The special codes would be transmitted along with each program, enabling a computer chip in the television set to screen out any programs with ratings parents deem objectionable.


Inquiry Into Police Rampage Ends In Charges to 7 but Few Answers
After a two-month investigation into a drunken spree by New York City police officers through six Washington hotels, police officials said yesterday that no more than 7 of the 942 officers in the capital at the time faced serious departmental charges.
The small number of officers identified stands in sharp contrast to initial reports from Washington, which indicated that dozens upon dozens of drunken New York officers were grabbing women, spraying fire extinguishers, pulling fire alarms and prancing about nude.
Washington hoteliers estimated at the time that up to 100 New York officers were involved.

As Sunday drew to a close after the huge water main break near Times Square, commuters were told to prepare for the worst: the vital West Side I.R.T. line would likely have major delays or be shut completely the next day, causing havoc as the work week began.
While New Yorkers often instinctively brace for the worst, the history of other recent subway disasters should have told them not to worry.
The trains would instead be back on track, bringing commuters to work despite the previous day's chaos.

A judge today withdrew his order that ABC News disclose the name of a confidential source used in a report that is the subject of a $10 billion libel suit by Philip Morris Companies Inc.

Today, Judge Theodore J. Markow of Richmond Circuit Court wrote that before he required ABC News to disclose its source, Philip Morris would have to supply more evidence that it could not get the information elsewhere and that it had a compelling need for the information.

Big Hurt's Bat Leaves A Lasting Impression
Frank Thomas left for the airport after hitting a two-run homer in the fourth inning tonight, and he must have placed the rest of the American League's touted offense in his suitcase.
Once Thomas departed, his teammates never scored again and the National League displayed power of its own by walloping three homers and rallying for a 3-2 victory.
While Thomas was flying from Dallas to Chicago because the White Sox have a workout Wednesday afternoon, the American League was fizzling and Manager Buck Showalter was scheming.
Showalter did not disguise how important it was for him to win this ballyhooed exhibition game, as he said it was even more important than returning every player to his team uninjured and even more important than playing both Rangers All-Stars.

The philosophizing wizard known as Prospero is a very angry man these days.
As portrayed by Patrick Stewart, in George C. Wolfe's blazingly vital, vastly enjoyable production of "The Tempest" at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, the dispossessed Duke of Milan seems white-hot with a fury that gives new punch to his phrase "rough magic."
Unlike most Prosperos of recent years, who have been presented as practitioners of an ordering art that parallels the playwright's and director's crafts, Mr.
Stewart's fascinating, combustible performance suggests that the real squall of the title is within the character himself.

Finesse Times Two

Claude Troisgros, 39, his son and the chef and owner of C. T., wore blue jeans, a short-sleeved shirt and loafers.
The younger Mr.
Troisgros, who spent 15 years running a restaurant in Brazil before coming to New York, exuded the style and swagger of a young chef on a roll.
His father, by contrast, could be a cartoon model of the stereotypical French chef: round, baldish, with a gray mustache and an easy smile.

A Hitch Develops in Drug-Testing Plans
As more than 5,000 athletes from 80 countries visit Atlanta this summer to test the various arenas that will be host to the 1996 Summer Olympics, organizers had hoped to begin operating the Olympic drug lab as well.
But with the Games a year away, the designated lab has yet to gain accreditation from the International Olympic Committee.
So the drug-testing apparatus that was supposed to be tested this summer will not be, and will instead be handled by I.O.C.-accredited labs in Los Angeles and Indianapolis.

This afternoon, the Bosnian Serbs slipped past the Dutch forces guarding the entrance to the town of Srebrenica.
The Dutch called in NATO warplanes, which United Nations officials said struck two Bosnian Serb tanks in air strikes this afternoon, but they were unable to stanch the Serbian advance.

Those "wanted" for removal from politics are 28 liberals accused of failing to greet the Contract With America with the rubber-stamp adoration of the Republicans.
Mr.
Paxon says that 170 Democrats fall into that category; the group selected for the poster contains an oddly disproportionate number of black, Hispanic, Jewish and female lawmakers.
The poster's 28 mug shots include 10 blacks, 1 Hispanic, 9 women and 8 Jews, some fitting in more than one category.
Only six of the pictures are of white men who are not Jewish.
These include Representative Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader, and David Bonior, the Democratic whip.


Metro-North Unveils Plan For Strike It Says Is Likely
Metro-North Railroad, saying that it expects 17 of its 19 labor unions to go on strike as early as midnight Saturday, released a detailed contingency plan yesterday, indicating it could transport half its 70,000 weekday rush-hour commuters to and from Manhattan on shuttle buses.
If a strike is called, the railroad said that it would cancel service on weekends and that during the week it would be forced to carry commuters by buses -- including some that lack air conditioning -- along clogged suburban roads to subway stations in the Bronx.

Nomo Steps to the Mound, And All Japan Is Watching
Takeshi Komatsu should have been at his office this morning.
Instead, dressed in his suit and carrying his briefcase, he was standing with about 200 other people in a light rain, staring at a huge television screen mounted on the side of a building.
"I'm going to go right after Nomo finishes," promised Komatsu, who works for a construction company.


Coming to Classrooms: The Real Pocahontas Story
This summer, children will be inundated with Pocahontas, Walt Disney's latest cartoon queen.
They will slurp grape juice from Pocahontas mugs, practice spelling with Pocahontas pencils, win Pocahontas dolls on the Boardwalk and snuggle in Pocahontas pajamas.
But come September, their teachers will stand at chalkboards and debunk Disney's sanitized version of the Pocahontas story, as they have debunked so many others: Columbus, Jefferson, Custer, Kennedy.


Judge Rules Susan Smith Is Fit for Trial on Murder Charges
The presiding judge has ruled that Susan Smith is mentally competent to stand trial in the drownings of her two sons, even though the state's psychiatrist says she may try to sabotage her own defense if she takes the stand, because she wants to die.
Mrs.
Smith, pale, listless and dependent on the anti-depressant drug Prozac to help her understand the court proceedings, is aware that she is on trial for her life, Judge William Howard of Circuit Court ruled today.


Big Hurt's Bat Leaves A Lasting Impression
Frank Thomas left for the airport after hitting a two-run homer in the fourth inning tonight, and he must have placed the rest of the American League's touted offense in his suitcase.
Once Thomas departed, his teammates never scored again and the National League displayed power of its own by walloping three homers and rallying for a 3-2 victory.
While Thomas was flying from Dallas to Chicago because the White Sox have a workout Wednesday afternoon, the American League was fizzling and Manager Buck Showalter was scheming.
Showalter did not disguise how important it was for him to win this ballyhooed exhibition game, as he said it was even more important than returning every player to his team uninjured and even more important than playing both Rangers All-Stars.
Was the Yankee owner George Steinbrenner at the Ballpark in Arlington?

Business Travel; A travel industry study shows it's best to keep on the move to avoid becoming a victim of crime.
MANY companies brief their employees about safety precautions while traveling.
But while tourists have been victims in a number of well-publicized brutal crimes in recent years, the rate of crime against adult American travelers is actually 40 percent less than the rate for Americans in general.
According to a recent report, for every 1,000 American adults, there were 213 crimes against their property or person in 1994.
In that same period, the rate for travelers, who were defined as someone more than 100 miles from home, was 127.8 crimes for every 1,000 travelers.
The data were weighted to account for the fact that Americans are at home more than they travel.

For Yen Do, editor of the largest Vietnamese-language daily in America, the establishment today of diplomatic relations between Hanoi and Washington marks the end of a half century of war that has tortured his nation and scattered two million of its people around the world.
It welcomes Vietnam into the community of nations, opens new possibilities for its economic development and may help efforts to foster democracy and human rights after 20 years of Communist rule, said Mr.

A Newark Bishop to Retire
For 19 years, the Rev.
Robert F. Garner has been Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Newark, overseeing the day-to-day administration of the 74 Catholic churches in Bergen County, one of the four counties that make up the archdiocese.
He has presided at thousands of confirmations, hundreds of baptisms and hundreds of weddings.
But in April he turned 75, the age at which a bishop is required by canon law to resign.
Pope John Paul II accepted Bishop Garner's resignation yesterday.
No replacement has been named.


Journal; The God Patrol
In case you haven't heard, there is no religious freedom in America -- but the religious right, thank heaven, is riding to the rescue.
The Christian Coalition -- armed with the blessings of both Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole -- is now pushing hard for a Religious Equality Amendment to the Constitution.
Our preacher politicians will make sure that anyone who wants to express religious sentiments in a public forum can do so without fear that some hostile court might blow the whistle, invoking some picky principle about the separation of church and state.
For those who just can't wait for Congress to finish rewriting the Bill of Rights and want a preview of how the Religious Equality Amendment would work, there's a test case playing out right now in Utah.
Last month, a choral teacher at West High School, a public school in Salt Lake City, chose two Christian songs for his choir to perform at graduation -- but was stopped by a Federal court, which insisted that secular anthems be sung instead.
Most students and parents were furious; the class valedictorian likened the court's repression to that of China's Tiananmen Square.
If only the Religious Equality Amendment were in place, the choir could have sung just what it wanted, and how much happier the graduation would have been!


Microbrewery With Big Plans Opens in Hong Kong
DAVID TOLLIDAY-WRIGHT bellied up to the wooden bar, squinted at a beetle-brown bottle with an unfamiliar label -- Crooked Island Ale, it said -- and watched as a reddish, pale liquid was caressed by a bartender into a tall glass.
Mr.

Silence.
"Eh," he said, the words gradually forming. "Not bad. It's not bad, not bad at all."


Tyson Reportedly Works Hard
MIKE TYSON is training harder than ever and has already knocked down "seven or eight" sparring partners, according to his co-manager, JOHN HORNE.
All of Tyson's workouts have been closed to the public, but Horne said yesterday that the former champion's weight is 219 pounds, his old fighting weight.
According to Horne and his partner, RORY HOLLOWAY, Tyson does road work at 4 A.M., running three to four miles.
Then he does calisthenics at the gym, followed by work with a strength and conditioning coach and sparring.
He has been sparring for several weeks.


Black Caucus Tells the President of Its Fears for Affirmative Action
President Clinton met with the Congressional Black Caucus today to hear its concerns on affirmative action, voting rights and the Federal budget and said that next week he would announce the results of his long-awaited review of Federal preference programs that are based on race and sex.
The 80-minute meeting in the State Dining Room of the White House, the President's first with the group this year, was a sensitive one because many black officials adamantly oppose any effort to scale back job and contracting programs intended to redress past discrimination, or basing them on financial need instead of race.


U.S. GRANTS VIETNAM FULL TIES; TIME FOR HEALING, CLINTON SAYS
Saying the time was at hand to "bind up our own wounds," President Clinton today extended full diplomatic recognition to Vietnam 22 years after the American withdrawal from a bitterly divisive war that still scars the national psyche.
Mr.
Clinton, the one-time student protester who avoided serving in a war he once said he "opposed and despised," announced the normalization of relations in a brief ceremony in the East Room attended by military figures, the families of those still missing in action and members of Congress who were veterans of the war and prisoners of the Vietnamese.


Dissidents Step Up Pressure

A hearing in Federal court has been scheduled for Sept. 6 in Minneapolis before Judge David S. Doty.

An Inadequate Police Investigation
The investigation into the drunken rampage by New York City cops in Washington, D.C., has ended with disappointing findings -- and a report that the public deserves to see in some form but that the Police Department will not release.
The net result is diminished confidence in the department's ability to police itself.
Two months ago, drunken officers tore through several Washington hotels groping women, destroying property and pulling false alarms, which, at one hotel, forced elderly guests into the rainy predawn streets.
The department waited far too long to get a vigorous investigation under way.

The Discovery was originally scheduled to make the eight-day mission, the spacecraft's 21st trip into space, five weeks ago, but NASA engineers postponed the mission because woodpeckers nesting on a nearby gantry bored holes in the insulation surrounding the spacecraft's external fuel tank.


Harnisch Knows The Time Is Now
The way Pete Harnisch figures it, things cannot go much worse for him in the second half of the season.
Acquired in an off-season trade with Houston to add a veteran arm to the Mets' pitching rotation, Harnisch's homecoming has been a frustrating experience.
The Commack, L.I., native and former Fordham pitcher is 1-7 with a 4.23 earned run average, his only victory having come against the Padres on May 30 in San Diego.
Since then he has lost five straight decisions, obscuring that fact that he kept the Mets in the game in a lot of his early starts before falling victim to a struggling bullpen.

3 Companies Are Charged in Power-Cable Accident That Shut Newark Airport
Three New Jersey construction companies have been accused of violating a state law in connection with the pile-driving accident last January that knocked out all electrical power at Newark International Airport's three passenger terminals and forced the airport to close for a day.
The state's Board of Public Utilities issued the citations last Friday but announced them only yesterday; they charged the companies under a year-old law designed to guarantee that the routes of buried electrical cables and pipelines are clearly marked before construction crews begin digging or doing other work near them.

Everything came sharply into focus.
We both became alert, sensing something different.
I grabbed her shoulders and, my voice echoing off the tiles, declared, "You are my daughter."


Tobacco Held to Be Drug That Must Be Regulated
The Food and Drug Administration has concluded for the first time that nicotine is a drug that should be regulated, and it has proposed limited, initial steps for regulating tobacco products, officials said today.
But in a sign of the delicacy of the issue -- and of the opposition in the Republican Congress to new restraints on smoking -- the agency is not using the authority it has to act on its own.
Instead, it has thrown the issue to the President, by submitting proposed regulations to the White House.
The proposals themselves are modest, involving only new limits on tobacco advertising and measures to curtail sales to young people.

CHRONICLE
The Miss America Pageant minus its bathing suits?
That is a distinct possibility, LEONARD HORN, the chief executive of the Miss America Organization, announced yesterday at a news conference at the Plaza Hotel.
During the Sept. 16 telecast of the pageant on NBC, viewers will be asked to call a "900" number and to vote on whether to proceed with the swimsuit parade.
Should even a one-vote majority say nay, Mr.
Horn said, the swimsuit portion will be canceled on the spot.
What happens next year remains to be seen.

First Chicago and NBD to Merge as Banks Scurry to Grow
The First Chicago Corporation and NBD Bancorp Inc. announced yesterday that they had agreed to merge in a deal valued at about $5.3 billion, providing yet another example of the relentless consolidation that is changing the landscape of commercial banking.

Moreover, it will have the country's fourth-largest credit card business and the biggest market share in Illinois, Michigan and Indiana.

Ulster Protestants March, Celebrating History, as Catholics Jeer
At 9:35 this morning, to the martial airs of fife-and-drum bands, the several hundred Protestant men of the Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge marched stiffly across a bridge over the Lagan River into an angry Roman Catholic neighborhood, to celebrate the 305th anniversary of Northern Irish Protestantism's proudest historical event -- its victory over Irish Catholicism.
As they and their ancestors have done for about 100 years, most of the Orangemen wore black suits draped with orange sashes and stoles, white gloves, and bowler hats, and carried furled black umbrellas.
They looked straight ahead, casting only sidelong glances at the police officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in riot gear, as they sealed off the parade route on the Lower Ormeau Road from the Catholics who live there.

Inkless Fingerprinting Starts For New York City Welfare
There is no ink, no paper towels, no wiping your hands afterwards, just two fingers pressed briefly against the glass of a computer screen.
But sitting on the steps of the St.
Nicholas welfare center in Harlem yesterday, Rani Taylor said the details of the procedure made no difference.
"Fingerprinting is fingerprinting," Ms.
Taylor said as she waited in line for her turn.
"Why should you have to go through it? They've already got your photo and your Social Security number."


Republicans Attack Clinton on Vietnam
Republicans in Congress bitterly attacked President Clinton today for extending full diplomatic recognition to Vietnam and accused him of selling out the families of Americans missing in Vietnam.
In a first Congressional hearing on the President's decision on Tuesday to establish relations -- 22 years after the American withdrawal from the war -- Republicans on the House International Affairs Committee spoke with unusual passion in asserting that President Clinton was in an unseemly rush to recognize Vietnam even though it has not provided a full accounting of the 1,618 Americans missing there.


Joel David Morgan; Artist Manager, 35
Joel David Morgan, an artist manager and concert presenter, died on Tuesday at St.
Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan.
He was 35 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause was AIDS, said Candace Flores, a friend.


Public to Decide Swimsuit Issue
Forget about feminists.
Even the chief executive of the Miss America Organization says he opposes the swimsuit segment of the annual pageant.
"I personally cannot rationalize putting a young college woman in a swimsuit and high heels," the A.P. yesterday quoted Leonard Horn as saying.


Keeping Mother's Trial in Hometown Could Be Crucial
The decision by Susan Smith's lawyer to keep her capital murder trial in her hometown might ultimately save her life, say legal experts and the people who have lived their lives in the same, small place.
As her lawyers and the state's prosecutor today continued the arduous process of picking a jury to hear the case, it was increasingly clear that it may be difficult to find 12 people in this close-knit community who will send her to die in the electric chair.


The Pop Life
Hard Times for Posters
On Tuesday Mayor Giuliani created an executive task force composed of representatives of 15 different city agencies to crack down on graffiti.
What this means for New York rock bands is trouble.
Included in the city's definition of graffiti is the posting of handbills on public property or on a private establishment whose owner does not want posters plastered on it.
There are many kinds of bills around Manhattan, advertising anything from a sublet to a cologne, but the majority of them are for concerts.
Community groups find them an eyesore; others say they are a cultural asset.
The Mayor's effort to enforce laws against defacement as part of his quality-of-life initiative began in October, when he created an anti-graffiti and vandalism unit of the New York City Police Department (that unit will now coordinate the new task force in conjunction with the Mayor's office).
Since then, a number of local rock bands have discovered that putting up posters for their concerts may mean a night in jail, after which they are instructed to return for a court date.
If found guilty, offenders are generally fined $50 to $250 or ordered to perform community service.


Essay; The Time Has Come
On the central moral-military challenge of his Presidency to lead the Western world in collective defense against bloodstained aggression -- Bill Clinton will be remembered in history as a man who feared, flinched and failed.
The policy long urged by Senator Bob Dole was to lift the pernicious arms embargo to Bosnians who want to fight for their country, and to support the defenders with air strikes at ammo dumps and supply lines of the invading Serbs.
Events have proved the Dole policy right.


Towing-Bids Ruling Is Criticized
An appellate court decision upholding the right of toll road authorities to award towing contracts without competitive bidding has drawn the wrath of Assemblyman Paul R. Kramer, Republican of Hamilton Township.
Mr.
Kramer, chairman of the Independent Authorities Committee, recently tabled a bill that would also have authorized no-bid contracts.

August Belmont 4th, a member of the socially prominent banking and horse racing family and the grandson of the founder of Belmont Park and breeder of the champion Man o' War, died Monday in Easton, Md., where he made his home.
He was 86.
The cause of death was a stroke, the family said.

School Prayer Anxieties
The motivations behind President Clinton's speech on religion in the schools were obvious and in some ways laudatory.
For purposes of his re-election, Mr.
Clinton needs to reassure swing voters that he endorses traditional religious values and practices.
He also needs to slow the legislative rush to pass an ill-advised Religious Equality Amendment being pushed by the Republican leadership in Congress.
Much of the President's speech at a suburban Virginia high school was devoted to stating existing law, making the obvious point that a variety of private religious actions and meetings are allowable on public school property.
That is to say, there is simply no need for an amendment to the First Amendment's guarantees of religious freedom.


Rockets Confirm Maxwell's Release
VERNON MAXWELL gave up on the Houston Rockets, and now the two-time defending champions have given up on him.
The Rockets confirmed yesterday they waived the mercurial Maxwell, also known as Mad Max, on June 30, the day before the National Basketball Association lockout of players halted any club-player dealings.


AT HOME WITH: Jennifer Saunders; Absolutely Catching, Bad Habits and All
It would be strange if Jennifer Saunders didn't identify at least a little with Edina Monsoon, the frenetic, trend-abusing publicity agent she plays in the television series "Absolutely Fabulous." After all, she created the character and has written the scripts for all 18 episodes.
But it only goes so far, Ms.
Saunders said, considering the matter as she sat behind a desk whose admirable lack of clutter spoke volumes about her organizational skills. (It spoke untruthfully, as it turned out. She admitted that earlier in the day she spent an hour and a half shoving everything out of sight.) If Edina's obsessions crackle around her like sparks from a Roman candle, Ms.
Saunders's waft gently, subtly.


A Second Fed Bank Study Finds Disparities in Mortgage Lending
White mortgage applicants with bad credit histories were only half as likely to be rejected for loans as black or Hispanic applicants with similar credit records, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago concluded in a study released today.
But the report, the latest effort by Government experts to measure bias in lending practices, did not find that discrimination by banks was widespread in all circumstances.
Black and Hispanic applicants with good credit histories were about as likely as white applicants with comparable records to receive bank approvals for mortgages, the study found.


Pfizer Names A Woman as Unit President
Pfizer Inc. appointed Karen L. Katen yesterday as president of its United States Pharmaceuticals Group, which generated about 30 percent of Pfizer's revenues of $8.3 billion last year.
Ms.
Katen, 46, a corporate vice president of Pfizer, has been executive vice president of the 4,500-member unit since 1993.
She will now be one of a handful of female executives with the possibility of becoming chief executive of a big pharmaceutical company in the next decade.


Study Says Cost Of Atom Bombs Is $3.9 Trillion
The United States has spent far more on nuclear weapons than it has acknowledged, about one-fourth to one-third of the entire military budget since 1945, according to an independent study made public today.
The study's authors reached their conclusion by totaling the costs of research and development, weapons delivery systems, security, communications and control systems, dismantlement costs and environmental cleanup.


Senior F.B.I. Agent Suspended in Probe Of a Deadly Siege
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has suspended a senior career agent as a result of a Justice Department inquiry into whether officials destroyed important documents about the agency's bloody 1992 standoff with a white separatist in Idaho, law-enforcement officials said today.
The suspension of the agent, E. Michael Kahoe, who was an official at F.B.I. headquarters during the Idaho siege, sent a shock wave through the agency's upper ranks.
Louis J. Freeh, the F.B.I.
Director, rushed to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to advise lawmakers of the development, including Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican of Utah and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.


Anti-Violence Chip for TV Gets Key Backing in House
Even as Senate Republicans expressed their opposition to Government requirements aimed at curbing violence on television, proposals for a so-called V-chip to block violent shows gained ground in the House today.
Representative Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio, an influential member of the House Commerce Committee, threw his support behind legislation that would require television manufacturers to include a chip to block violent shows in all new sets and predicted that the House would pass the measure this month.

Steps Against Nicotine
The Food and Drug Administration has concluded for the first time that nicotine is a drug that should be regulated as such, and has proposed limited steps for regulating tobacco products, Federal officials said yesterday.
But, in a sign of the delicacy of the issue, the agency is not using the powers it has to act on its own, instead submitting proposed regulations to the White House.

China Gives Big Van Deal To Mercedes
Snubbing American car manufacturers and fueling suspicion that China would make American industry pay for the diplomatic dispute with Washington, China today gave a much-coveted $1 billion contract to Mercedes-Benz of Germany
The decision to award what is one of the biggest automotive deals in China was announced as President Jiang Zemin, on a four-day visit to Germany, toured the Mercedes plant in Sindelfingen, about 100 miles south of here.


Courtroom Superstars, Videotaped Confessions
What do William Kennedy Smith and Colin Ferguson, Joel Steinberg and Hedda Nussbaum, the Bobbitts,the Menendez boys and O. J. Simpson have in common?
Right.
All have starred in hit televised trials, and you can catch highlights of their performances again Saturday on "The Show Business of Crime and Punishment." Given their prominence on the program and the graphic scenes of violence and sex captured by the camera, you may wonder whether the pictures are merely examples of the evening's themes or whether the themes are merely pretexts for the pictures.
To give the producers the benefit of the doubt, this edition of "America Undercover" does provide a snappy review of the spreading use of camcorders by the police at the scene of a crime, and of other evidence provided by surveillance cameras and videotaped confessions.
It is pointed out, for example, that in the Central Park jogger rape trial the jury was more impressed by confessions that had been videotaped than by the old-fashioned ones that had been written down by the police.
Defendants may take consolation from the acquittal of Dr.
Jack Kevorkian, often in court for assisting in suicides, by the grace of a video camera that showed the departed taking an active role in his own demise.


Congressman Is Cleared of Breaking Oath
The House Ethics Committee said today that it would take no action against Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, on charges of violating a secrecy oath by making public classified information.
Mr.
Torricelli had contended in a letter to President Clinton, a copy of which he gave to The New York Times, that a Guatemalan military officer who was a paid agent of the Central Intelligence Agency had ordered the killings of an American innkeeper and a guerrilla leader married to an American lawyer.
The Times published an article on the letter on March 23.

Court Didn't Dismiss Affirmative Action
To the Editor:
"A Court Running in the Wrong Direction" (editorial, July 6), accusing the Supreme Court of "flawed logic and misreading of evidence," misreads what the Court has done on affirmative action.
The Court's decision cannot be portrayed as a "repudiation of affirmative action," nor is it fair to attribute to the Court the premise that "African-Americans no longer need the law's protection."


Parole Officer Is Suspended Over Killings
A New Jersey parole officer who had been supervising Darnell Collins when he went on a murderous rampage last month in New Jersey and Manhattan was suspended yesterday after officials learned that, hours before the killings began, Mr.
Collins had telephoned the parole officer to say that he was "having a problem with drugs."
Mario Paparozzi, the assistant chief of New Jersey's Bureau of Parole, said Mr.
Collins told the parole officer, John Goodman, on the afternoon of June 16, a Friday, that he expected to be accepted into a drug treatment program the following Monday.


Tilting Against the Poor
A House Appropriations subcommittee dominated by Republicans voted this week to chop education programs for poor students and job training programs for low-paid workers.
It scaled back a program designed to cut medical costs by identifying unnecessary medical procedures.
It eliminated entirely a program that helps states design new educational standards.
The vision behind the G.O.P.'s 1996 budget for education, labor and health is radically different -- and woefully misguided.


International Briefs; Mitsubishi Cutbacks
The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, Japan's third-largest auto maker, said yesterday that it would cope with an expected fall in exports caused by the strong yen by reducing the number of its temporary workers.
Mitsubishi said it had eliminated 700 temporary workers at its factories since April and plans to dismiss 300 more by September -- down to a total of 2,300, a cut of about 30 percent.

World News Briefs; Kashmir Rebels Threaten To Kill Their Hostages
Kashmiri insurgents holding five Western hostages -- an American, two Britons, a German and a Norwegian -- threatened today to kill them if the Indian Government does not free more than 20 captured guerrilla leaders.
In a statement to The Associated Press in Srinagar, the capital of the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir, the militants warned that the hostages would be killed if their demands were not met by Saturday.
Muslim rebels fighting for independence in India's only Muslim-dominated state have kidnapped Westerners before, but the captives have always been freed unharmed.

Speed Up. Raise This. Expand That. Whew!
The rebellion brewing among major league hitters need not arise.
The originally announced plan to speed up games by making them remain anchored in the batter's box has been abandoned.
Instead, batters will be permitted only to stray no farther than three feet from the box when they step out.
"I don't go for strolls when I hit," Wade Boggs of the Yankees remarked after hearing about the rule that will be implemented July 28.
Boggs had been an outspoken critic of the original plan, but he can live with the three-foot rule.

In what is beginning to appear to be an inevitable march to his fifth consecutive victory in the Tour de France, Miguel Indurain rode another impressive race today only to chalk up another second place.
That made three in the last four daily stages, plus his victory Sunday in the individual time trial.
Even if he did not win the last of two Alpine stages, Indurain lost no time to a rider who threatens his reign.
The winner was Marco Pantani, an Italian who rides for the Carrera team and who is considered to be one of the strongest climbers in the sport.

Why? Don't Ask
Hugh Grant's public embarrassment distressed many of his fans and gave the rest of the English-speaking world a sugar rush of Schadenfreude.
Not only was England's floppy-haired star caught with a prostitute in a BMW on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard, he had the exquisite sense of timing to do it on the eve of his new feel-good comedy, "Nine Months."
Pleasure in the misery of others is not the healthiest of emotions, but given this set of circumstances it seems forgivable.
Sex is rivaled only by shame for the public's attention, and this story has both, with fame and beauty thrown in -- not to mention a perfume called "Pleasures," which his girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley, is promoting.

It's Another World Mark For Morceli In the 1,500
Until now, Noureddine Morceli had been pumping his slender arms, clenching his crooked teeth and running with great success against the records of others.
But tonight, as he sprinted the last lap utterly alone, the Algerian was running only against himself.
It was his own world record in the 1,500 meters that Morceli was trying to break under a yellow moon on the Cote d'Azur.
And it was his own record that fell in spectacular fashion as Morceli finished the metric mile in 3 minutes 27.37 seconds, the equivalent of a 3:45 mile.
Morceli, who holds world marks at four distances, set the mile record at 3:44.39.

Stock Option Plan Pays Off For Chemical Bank Workers
It was touch and go, but 38,000 workers at the Chemical Banking Corporation became a little wealthier yesterday thanks to an afternoon surge in the stock market that pushed Chemical stock up 37.5 cents to $50.375, allowing them to cash in on a special share offering the company announced a year ago.
The offering was similar to the stock-option plans available to top executives of the company, except that it was offered only to employees below the rank of senior vice president, and was decidedly less lucrative than the executive plans.
But even if the stock plan offered to tellers, branch managers and others was not enough to make them rich, it caught their attention and made the stock price a prime topic of discussion the last three days.


Max O. Urbahn Is Dead at 83; Designed Vast NASA Building
Max O. Urbahn, a prolific architect of government buildings whose work included the design of what is generally believed to be the largest structure in the world, the Vehicle Assembly Building at Cape Canaveral, Fla., died on Sunday at his home in Stonington, Conn.
He was 83.
Mr.
Urbahn, who had his own firm in New York City from 1946 until 1978, designed buildings for all three United States military services, the Coast Guard, and various Federal agencies.
NASA was his client for the Vehicle Assembly Building, a vast box designed in 1965 to shelter the Saturn rockets that powered American astronauts to the moon.

As the chances of a United Nations pullout from Bosnia rise, the United States and its NATO allies have all but completed plans to carry out an evacuation plan that assumes the worst: cramped sea ports, snow, fighting and poor roads.
President Clinton has promised to send as many as 25,000 American soldiers for a 60,000-member NATO force to extricate 24,700 United Nations peacekeeping troops spread out over Bosnia.


Margot Wittkower; Interior Designer, 93
Margot Wittkower, one of the first women to practice interior design in Europe and the widow of the art historian Rudolf Wittkower, died on July 3 at her home in Manhattan.
She was 93.
Mrs.
Wittkower, whose original name was Margot Holzmann, was born in Berlin in 1902.
After establishing herself as a designer in Berlin, she left for London with her husband in the 1930's.
She continued her work there, specializing in apartment interiors and furniture design.
The Wittkowers were especially drawn to neo-Palladian architecture, and she eventually became an authority on the subject.


New Posts for 2 Times Critics
New assignments for two critics on the cultural news staff of The New York Times were announced yesterday by Joseph Lelyveld, executive editor.
Bernard Holland was named chief music critic.
He succeeds Edward Rothstein, who was appointed to the new position of cultural critic at large.
Mr.
Holland, 62, has been a music critic at The Times since 1981.
A native of Norfolk, Va., he was graduated from the University of Virginia, where he studied literature and philosophy.
From 1958 to 1966 he studied piano and composition at the Vienna Academy of Music, at the Paris Conservatory and in London.
Before joining The Times he wrote about classical and popular music for several publications, including The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Mr.
Rothstein, as critic at large, will cover a range of subjects, among them cultural policy, technology, intellectual life and esthetic issues.
Before his appointment as chief music critic in 1991, Mr.
Rothstein, now 42, was the music critic of The New Republic and a contributor to several journals.
He holds degrees from Yale and Columbia and a doctorate in music and mathematics from the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago.
He is the author of "Emblems of Mind: The Inner Life of Music and Mathematics," which was published by Times Books in the spring.
The appointments will take effect with the new music season in the fall.


Secret Trials Are Reported In Nigeria
With reports from Nigeria that secret tribunals have begun sentencing and possibly executing opponents of the military Government, there have been rising calls internationally for the release of political prisoners and the respect of human rights.
In recent days, Nigerian newspapers have repeatedly hinted that at least 18 military officers and 5 civilians have been secretly convicted of plotting to overthrow the Government of Gen.
Sani Abacha and given long prison terms or death sentences.
According to a report in The Times of London last week, some detainees may have already been executed.

AIDS Housing Fees Will Be Redirected
New York City announced yesterday that it would substantially cut its payments to hotels that provide emergency housing to people with AIDS and would use the money to develop permanent housing for AIDS cases.
Starting on Sept. 1 the city will cut by nearly 20 percent the payments made to operators of 40 single-room-occupancy hotels who provide emergency housing for people with AIDS referred by the Human Resources Administration.
The H.R.A. now pays $900 to $1,500 a person monthly.
The new fees will range from $720 to $1,260.

The 10% Solution
The Democrats and Republicans have finally reached a consensus that tinkering at the margins of the tax code will not provide the tax reform the nation wants.
The core issue is, what kind of reform?
Leading Republicans have proposed dramatic changes, including a national sales tax, which would replace the income tax, and a single-rate flat tax.
These plans share the virtue of simplicity but defeat the principle of progressive taxation, under which you are taxed according to your ability to pay.


Ethics Panel Fails to Agree On a Hearing On Packwood
The Senate Ethics Committee failed again today to reach agreement on whether to hold public hearings on allegations of sexual and official misconduct against Senator Bob Packwood, as pressure for such hearings appeared to be building.
The committee had planned to meet on Thursday, but after tonight's session, no new meeting had been scheduled.
"I don't know what the schedule's going to look like," Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada and vice chairman of the committee, said as the meeting broke up tonight.
"That will be up to the chairman."


Ringo, the Fourth Beatle, Is Back Behind Those Drums
His comic timing and downtrodden look made him the natural cinematic focus of both "A Hard Day's Night" and "Help!," and his inventive but never showy drumming was a distinctive part of the Beatles' sound.
Yet because he sat at the back, bashing away at his drums while his bandmates shook their shaggy heads and harmonized, and because he wrote and sang the fewest (and mostly the slightest) songs, Ringo Starr has been regarded by many as the last and least of the Fab Four.
Mr.
Starr has been known to walk out on interviewers tactless enough to lean on this point, but these days he isn't letting it bother him.
Let's face it: having been a Beatle at all is still a reasonably good meal ticket.
Lately, in fact, he has been collaborating with Paul McCartney and George Harrison on "The Beatles Anthology," a vast audio-video project due in the fall, complete with two songs on which the former Beatles added tracks to working tapes recorded by John Lennon shortly before he was killed in 1980.


METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY  FIRST FINGERPRINTING FOR CITY WELFARE
To Mayor Giuliani and other officials, a Social Security number and picture are not enough to prevent people from applying for welfare benefits under two or more names.
For the first time, despite opposition from civil libertarians, the city began using a computerized "finger imaging" system to thwart fraudulent claims.  [ B3. ]


BUSINESS DIGEST
Higher Earnings Spur Rally in Stock Market Stocks established another round of records, spurred by higher corporate earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 46.69 points, to 4,727.29.
At one point, the Dow rose more than 50 points, setting off the New York Stock Exchange's circuit breakers for the eighth time this year.
Analysts said it was a wild day of trading as institutions placed five rounds of "buy" programs in about an hour, with much of the buying concentrated in technology issues.
The S.&amp; P. 500 index also set a record, rising 6.11 points, to 560.89.  [ Page D8. ]


Becoming His Own Man
Late in May, James Dimon learned that Smith Barney's bond department was still placing some big trading bets, despite his orders that it rein in risks.
Worse, the department wasn't earning much money, even with the market enjoying a spectacular spring rally.
So, after consulting with colleagues, Mr.
Dimon sent heads rolling.
As chief operating officer, he forced out John F. Lyness, the managing director in charge of bond trading, who left the firm on May 26.
Three top aides soon followed him out the door in what became known around the firm as "the Memorial Day massacre." Mr.
Lyness "hadn't done as well as he might have done," Mr.
Dimon said in a recent interview.
Mr.
Lyness did not respond to requests for comment.

Warner Cancels a Book After Cult Accusations
In the crossroads where publishing and public relations meet, a controversial author can be good news or a big, banging headache.
Warner Books has decided that Frederick P. Lenz, author of "Surfing the Himalayas: A Spiritual Adventure," a book it had been planning to publish this winter, is the latter, and has taken the rare step of dropping the book.
Laurence J. Kirshbaum, Warner's chief executive, said yesterday that the book was canceled because of "marketing differences with the author." But people in the publishing industry said Warner had become wary of the book after a magazine reporter called to tell the publisher that Mr.
Lenz had been described in news articles as a cult leader.

Judge Nearing Decision on an Arrangement to Keep The Citadel All Male
A Federal judge appeared ready today to challenge the legitimacy of an 11th-hour agreement between South Carolina and a private women's college that would keep women out of The Citadel, a public, all-male military college here.
Judge C. Weston Houck of Federal District Court asked whether the South Carolina Attorney General, Charles M. Condon, had the authority to sign a contract with Converse College, a private women's college in Spartanburg that has agreed to develop a military-style training institute for women.
An appeals court ruling requires the judge to determine whether the Converse program is a suitable alternative for women who might want to enter The Citadel.


An Accord For Devils To Stay Seems Set
A deal to keep the Devils in New Jersey is virtually done, a lawyer for the team said yesterday.
"We have a final draft, and everyone is looking at it, making comments and discussing modifications," Alan Berman, a lawyer for the Devils' law firm, LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &amp; MacRae, said late yesterday.
"The bulk of the deal is done. I'm hopeful we can finalize it tomorrow."

President Defends a Place For Religion in the Schools
President Clinton declared today that the First Amendment "does not convert our schools into religion-free zones," and ordered the Government to distribute national guidelines explaining the wide degree of religious expression allowed in schools under current law.
"I am deeply troubled that so many Americans feel that their faith is threatened by the mechanisms that are designed to protect their faith," Mr.
Clinton said in a carefully worded speech aimed at outflanking Republican proposals for a constitutional amendment on school prayer.


Bob Ross, 52, Dies; Was Painter on TV
Bob Ross, the bushy-haired host of "Joy of Painting" on public television who parlayed the success of his program into an industry of art books and supplies, died on July 4.
He was 52.
The cause was cancer, said Walter J. Kowalski, the chief executive officer of Bob Ross Inc., in Sterling, Va.


New Option for Worried Parents: Drug Testing at Home
Once, the only way for parents to learn if their children used drugs was to ask, pry, or maybe spy.
But now, a Massachusetts company is giving parents another option: a drug test that begins in the home, with a snip of a child's hair.
At a midtown news conference yesterday, officials of the Psychemedics Corporation, a small drug-testing company, announced that they were starting a service that will allow parents to send samples of their sons' and daughters' hair to the company's lab -- and learn by mail whether the children are using marijuana, cocaine, heroin or other drugs.


Reducing the Risks For Older Drivers
I WENT for a drive the other day inside a small room at New York University.
My guide was William Schiff, a professor of applied psychology, and before I was done I managed to avoid a reckless school bus and make a safe left turn against oncoming traffic -- but I did hit Mr.
Schiff's daughter.
On the big television screen I was facing, she came out from between two cars in the shade, and I was slow putting my foot on the brake.
Her father was understanding.


Crossing Central Park South, 2 Women Are Killed by a Truck
Two pedestrians were killed yesterday after a laundry truck that delivers sheets and towels to mid-Manhattan hotels hit them as they crossed Central Park South at Seventh Avenue, the police said.
One victim was dead on arrival at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
The second died later during surgery, the hospital said.
The police said the two women tried to dash across the street 20 feet outside the crosswalk as the truck turned the corner.
Witnesses said the two women were apparently trying to make it before the light changed.

Spanish Woman Battles Buddhists for Her Son, the Lama
In the brilliant sunshine and crisp air of the Alpujarra mountains in southern Spain, Maria Torres gazed over the terraced rooftops of stone houses stacked on the steep slope, the home of a small Buddhist community.
Miss Torres, 41, a travel agent who converted to Buddhism 20 years ago, said she was worrying about her son Osel, who is 10.
She is struggling with Tibetan monks, who believe the boy is a reincarnated lama, to gain more control over his upbringing.


Tale of Tuna Fish and the Men Who Love Them
GIANT BLUEFIN
By Douglas Whynott
242 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $21.
Only two decades ago, the bluefin tuna fish, or horse mackerel, was "worth five cents a pound and served as cat food," writes Douglas Whynott in "Giant Bluefin," an engaging report on tuna fishing in New England.
When tuna tournaments were held, he adds, the fish were hung up as giant trophies, then disposed of by being sunk or hauled off to a dump.


Hand Over Israeli Bases? No Way, Rabbis Tell Troops
In a ruling that could affect thousands of Orthodox Jews in the Israeli Army, a group of influential rabbis said today that soldiers must refuse orders to hand over army bases in the West Bank to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Although it is far from clear how many soldiers would obey the rabbis, the religious ruling could cause the army difficulties when it begins to withdraw in the West Bank as part of plans to expand Palestinian self-rule.


Graf Investigated for Tax Evasion
STEFFI GRAF, the world's top-ranked women's player, is suspected of tax evasion and is being investigated by German authorities, officials said yesterday.
Her father and manager, PETER GRAF, is also under investigation, the Mannheim prosecutor PETER WECHSUNG said.
Ten prosecutors and tax investigators searched the Graf family compound in her hometown of Bruhl on May 23 and took away cartons of documents as evidence, Wechsung said.


Witnesses Barred
The defense in the trial of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Muslim cleric charged with directing a terror-bombing conspiracy in the New York area, suffered what it called a critical blow yesterday when the judge barred defense lawyers from calling several major witnesses.


New Hope for Burmese Democracy
The release of the political prisoner Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon, formerly Rangoon, is good news.
Mrs.
Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, had been under house arrest for nearly six years.
The next test for the regime, which changed the name of the country from Burma to Myanmar, will be to follow Ms.
Aung San Suu Kyi's freedom with a return to some form of political pluralism and with other improvements in human rights.
Mrs.
Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won elections under her leadership in 1990.
The military refused to recognize the results, imprisoning and intimidating many of the newly elected legislators.
Burmese expatriates say torture is still routinely used in prisons and by the military in its repression of ethnic minorities.


Starbucks Review Narrowed to Goodby
The Starbucks Coffee Company said yesterday that it had further narrowed a three-month review on its account to Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, which will make a final presentation in the next two weeks.
The account, with billings estimated at $7 million, had been at the Evans Group in Seattle for the last five years until Starbucks and Evans agreed to part ways in April.


A Fierce Rivalry to House Olympic Teams
Tommy knew Leah, whose husband, Love, ran track in college where his coach was Mel, whose lawyer is Bill, who is married to Laryssa, who is originally from Ukraine.
That in a nutshell is how the Ukrainian Olympic team chose this small west Georgia city as its training base for the Summer Olympics next year.
It is the Southern version of networking, known here as "doin' bidness," and it has helped this city of 15,000 snatch a bit of the same spotlight that will be shining on its much larger neighbor Atlanta, 45 miles to the east.


Two Exchanges Plan a Move Across the Hudson
The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange said yesterday that they intended to shift their trading operations to Jersey City, in a move that could transfer more than 5,000 jobs out of New York City.
The two commodities exchanges, which have signed a letter of intent with the state of New Jersey, said they planned to build a nine-story, 275,000-square-foot building adjacent to Jersey City's Exchange Place financial district, which they planned to occupy by the second quarter of 1998.

Technology Issues Lead Market to Another Mark
Stocks went into orbit yesterday, not only reaching record levels but also triggering the so-called circuit breaker designed to stabilize the market.
The New York Stock Exchange imposed its downtick rule at 3:11 P.M. to curb program trading, or stock-index arbitrage, which goes into effect when the Dow Jones industrial average rises more than 50 points.
It was the eighth time this year that the limits went into effect, the last occurring on May 31.

Tussaud's and a Movie Chain Are Negotiating on 42d St. Site
In the latest effort to revive the ghostly corridor of deteriorating buildings along Manhattan's famed 42d Street, city and state officials are negotiating with Madame Tussaud's, the renowned London wax museum, and AMC Entertainment, a movie theater chain, over plans to open new entertainment attractions in the city's old theater district.
Under the plan being discussed, the two companies together would take over the site of three adjacent old theaters between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, spending $150 million to create a 335,000-square-foot complex housing a high-tech wax museum and the city's largest movie theater, with a total of 25 screens.


Good Morning, Vietnam


A Roly-Poly Computer
AMONG the virtual bells and dizzying whistles at the PC Expo at the Jacob K. Javits Center last month, the Archistrat computers from Panda Project Inc. were a design standout.
The Boca Raton, Fla., company's new products include a "4s" server (the brains of a computer network), which Stanford W. Crane Jr., Panda Project's founder, said was powerful enough to drive 500 personal computers.
The "4b" workstation is intended for home or office use and is the first universal platform computer, meaning it is compatible with both I.B.M. and Macintosh systems and can be easily upgraded.
The "4s" is $10,400; a price for the "4b" has not been established.
Panda Archistrat won a trophy for booth design (shown above, with the "4b" workstation), which was designed by Janine and Jon James of the Moderns, a New York firm.

CAR LIKE SIMPSON'S IS PUT AT SCENE
Prosecutors at the O. J. Simpson trial zeroed in today on the testimony of a defense witness who said he saw a white sport utility vehicle, possibly a Ford Bronco, leaving the crime scene around 10:40 P.M. the night Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman were killed.
The witness said the driver had braked suddenly and then accelerated quickly as he rounded the corner, driving south.
But defense lawyers regularly reminded the jury that if the vehicle turned south, toward Wilshire Boulevard, rather than north toward Sunset Boulevard, it was traveling away from Mr.
Simpson's home, a five-minute drive from Mrs.
Simpson's condominium.


Once-Isolated Democrat Draws Crowds in Burma
For years, the house at 54 University Avenue in Yangon was a place so off-limits, so forbidden, that few Burmese dared to walk past the rusting metal gate, and none dared to stop.
To linger at the gate was to invite arrest by the plainclothed secret police who patrolled the street at all hours.
But today, the curb outside No. 54 was a place of pilgrimage and raucous celebration, drawing hundreds of the curious and the committed, all of them wanting to catch at least a glimpse of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition leader.


3 of 4 Guilty of Assault in Officer's Beating in Bay Ridge
Three of four young men accused of beating an off-duty police sergeant in front of his apartment building in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, in October were found guilty of first-degree assault yesterday.
The charge was less severe than the attempted murder charge the District Attorney's office had sought a conviction on.
A fourth defendant -- whom the sergeant, Louis Cosentino, had at first failed to identify properly in court -- was found not guilty of all charges.


Vietnam Is Said to Harass American Medical Aid Team
Members of a delegation of American scientists and doctors that recently visited Vietnam to assess health problems say that Vietnamese customs officials ransacked their belongings and confiscated many of the documents and tissue specimens they had come to collect.
The nine Americans, an official delegation from the National Institute of Environmental Health Science, arrived in Vietnam on June 20 for conferences and investigations aimed at assessing health problems shared by the two countries, including the possible effects of dioxin, a contaminant of the defoliant spray dropped over parts of the country during the Vietnam War.


No. 3 Bond-Rating Service Gives City an A-, and Giuliani Cheers
Four years ago, Moody's Investors Service disappointed City Hall by downgrading New York City's bonds.
On Monday, Standard &amp; Poor's did the same.
So yesterday, when the lesser-known Fitch Investors Service declared that it would not downgrade, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani treated the announcement as a bit of a triumph.
"This is really good news for the city," he said, after aides summoned reporters for what they were billing as a major announcement.

Imagine a program that imposes no costs on employers and does not require an army of bureaucrats to administer.
Well, stop imagining and start admiring the earned-income tax credit, which in the words of Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, sends a "powerful message that we value work -- even the work of those with pathetically low wages."


China Asks Clinton To Reaffirm Policy On Taiwan's Status
The Chinese Government said yesterday that President Clinton should reaffirm that Taiwan is part of China, and declare that Taiwan's President will not be allowed to make any more visits to the United States if Washington wants to begin thawing its frosty relations with Beijing.
A senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official cited a restoration of the status quo on Taiwan as it existed before Taiwan's President was allowed to visit the United States last month as a minimum requirement for another high-level meeting between the United States and China.

U.P.S. Cancels Some Mexican Services in a Setback to Trade Pact
The opening of Mexican markets to American business under the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement faltered for the first time this week with the decision by United Parcel Service to cancel some of its ground services in Mexico.
U.P.S., the American package delivery giant, said Tuesday that it would stop its cross-border deliveries by ground transporation between the United States and Mexico as of July 31.
The company made the decision even though trade officials of the United States and Mexico have been trying to improve market conditions for U.P.S. in Mexico.

N.A.A.C.P. Audit Shows Lavish Spending, Members Say
A long-awaited audit of the troubled National Association for the Advancement of Colored People shows that "lavish" spending and shoddy management by some of the group's top officials helped create a $3.8 million debt, which has hobbled the organization for months, several board members said today.
Tens of thousands of dollars were spent on personal trips or expensive limousines, lap-top computers, sky pagers and other items that a cash-strapped organization might do without, the board members said.


Romanian Coach Keeps Up the Fight
Lavinia Milosovici, a 19-year-old acrobatic powerhouse, rises every morning from under a satin pink bedcover, glances at a poster of Michael Jackson hanging above her television and prepares for another seven hours in the well-worn gymnasium a few steps from her dormitory.
Milosovici, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in 1992 and one of Romania's big hopes for the Games in Atlanta, savors some of the Western frills allowed since the toppling of the Communists.
She keeps her prize money (minus 65 percent taxes), earns a salary and, now and then, relishes a croissant or some ice cream.


G.O.P. Goes Courting Another Eager Convert
As Capitol Hill courtships go, the wooing of a Democratic representative, Mike Parker of Mississippi, by the Republican Speaker, Newt Gingrich, has about it a quality of colonial-era bundling -- the two of them smiling separately in the same conservative hotbed, wondering at the possibilities across the frayed divider of party loyalty.
"With a little help, he'll go over," Representative W. J. (Billy) Tauzin of Louisiana said of Mr.
Parker, his friend and fellow member of the House's fervently conservative Democrat Coalition.
This is a restive minority within the crestfallen new minority party, whose 23 members have been increasingly open to the Speaker's Contract With America and his blandishments to switch parties and enroll with the new majority.

Fresh from a bruising battle with the State Legislature, Gov.
George E. Pataki took advantage of a national platform today to praise the new agenda he has set for New York State and to depict himself as a foot soldier in what he called "the conservative revolution."
In last year's campaign and during this year's legislative session, Mr.
Pataki, a Republican, seemed more pragmatist than ideologue -- presumably because New York is a relatively liberal state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans.
But in a speech today to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy group, Mr.
Pataki embraced the conservative movement with unusual vigor.

Levi's Steals a Page From Letterman
Levi Strauss &amp; Company, in its largest single brand marketing effort ever, is trying to better David Letterman more than 50 times over by offering consumers "the top 501 reasons" to wear Levi's 501 jeans.
And for the first time, a Levi's campaign appearing in the United States will include work by the company's British agency.
The campaign, which runs through December, includes television commercials, print ads and outdoor advertising.
Like Mr.
Letterman's nightly top 10 lists, the reasons are numbered; "reason No. 032," for instance, is "You only have to wash them sometimes," while "reason No. 041" is "If crazed psycho killers are dragging you behind their van at high speeds, they probably won't rip."

Waco Inquiry Is Said to Use N.R.A. Experts
A Republican-led House committee conducting an inquiry into the raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., brought experts hired by the National Rifle Association on its trip to Texas in June to examine remnants of weapons found at the site, the N.R.A. said today.
At the time, the staff members of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee who visited Texas for the inspection on June 26 did not identify the experts as paid consultants to the rifle association.
The N.R.A. has been a fierce critic of the Government's actions in Waco, particularly of the Feb. 26, 1993, raid by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

Aetna Adds $750 Million To Cover Cleanup Claims
The Aetna Life and Casualty Company, in a move to disperse the uncertainty caused by its large exposure to claims for environmental damages, said yesterday that it had added $750 million to its reserves to cover those claims.
Although the move will result in a second-quarter loss of several hundred million, it was praised by many analysts as a big step toward rejuvenating the big insurance company.
Aetna hopes that with the increase in its environmental reserves to $1.2 billion, it has set aside enough to pay for environmental claims and will no longer use its profits and capital to pay those claims bit by bit, year by year.

Taking Control, State Ousts Newark's School Officials
State education officials took control of the Newark Board of Education's headquarters today, dismissing top school executives and assuming responsibility for the day-to-day operations of New Jersey's largest school district.
The culmination of the 10-year battle to control the troubled district came after the New Jersey Supreme Court voted to reject a request by the Newark school board to delay the dismissals and the takeover.

The decision by Susan Smith's lawyer to keep her capital murder trial in her hometown might ultimately save her life, say legal experts and the people who have lived their lives in the same, small place.
As her lawyers and the state's prosecutor today continued the arduous process of picking a jury to hear the case, it was increasingly clear that it may be difficult to find 12 people in this close-knit community who will send her to die in the electric chair.

Under the terms of the deal, Ciba would acquire 49.9 percent of Hexcel's common stock in exchange for Ciba Composites.
Hexcel would also pay an estimated $80 million in cash and securities to Ciba to reflect Hexcel's debt and certain liabilities.

Senate Rejects Exemption for a Meat Rule
The Senate narrowly refused today to exempt safeguards against contaminated meat from a bill imposing limits on Federal regulations dealing with health and the environment.
The vote, 51 to 49, came after a full day of debate on the Democratic amendment, which would let a new rule of meat inspections be imposed free of any possible challenge under the regulatory legislation.

Lundquist Takes Over Football on TNT
VERNE LUNDQUIST will join Turner Sports full time and become TNT's National Football League announcer for the coming season, replacing GARY BENDER.
Lundquist was already TBS's lead National Basketball Association announcer.


Liberties; West Coast Story
Not since yuppies made the wrenching discovery back in 1985 that Brie actually could get too ripe, has the Upper West Side had such an identity crisis.
Wendy Wasserstein knew something was awry when she walked into a building on Central Park West the other day, looking for an apartment, and was proudly informed by the doorman: "You know who lives here? Steven Spielberg's screenwriter and Julia Roberts's agent."


A Move Intended to Attract Jobs
Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman announced changes yesterday that she said would turn New Jersey's "regulatory maze into a straight path for business," helping the state attract and keep jobs.

Oscar Rules Change For Documentaries
Responding to widespread criticism that it has ignored the best work being done by documentary film makers, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has changed the procedures under which feature-length documentary films are nominated for Academy Awards.
The new procedures, which call for more judges to view the large number of entries, are a response to the hue and cry over the academy's decision earlier this year not to nominate "Hoop Dreams" in the best documentary category.
The oversight seemed inexplicable, since the film earned ecstatic reviews and was regarded by many critics as one of the best films of the year, documentary or dramatic.
At the Academy Awards, "Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision" was named best documentary feature.


Corrections
A brief report in the Book Notes column yesterday about the coming autobiography of a former Surgeon General misspelled her given name and misstated the publication schedule.
The author is Dr.
Joycelyn Elders; her book is due in the fall of 1996, not 1995.


Yankees Look Like All-Star Squad
Their starting pitcher kept them in the game early.
Their hitters provided him with more than enough runs.
Everything the Yankees did so poorly in the first half of the season they did right last night.
This looked a lot like the 1994 Yankees and the team they were supposed to be in 1995.


Boris Margo, Surrealist, 92, And Inventor
Boris Margo, an artist who was part of the Surrealist branch of the New York School, died on July 5 at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Mass.
He was 92 and for the last decade had spent his summers in Provincetown, Mass., and Venice, Fla.
The cause was respiratory complications after surgery, said his nephew Stanley Zimiles of Lido Beach, L.I.

A front-page headline yesterday about a newly identified illness carried by deer ticks referred incorrectly in some copies to the organism that causes it.
As the article stated, it is a bacterium, not a virus.


Sports of The Times; The Start Of Something Special
WHEN Jason Isringhausen, 22 years old, walks out to the mound for the Mets in Wrigley Field next Monday night to pitch in his first major league game, a good portion of his hometown of Brighton, Ill., will be in the stands.
About 35 to 40 people will have made the five-hour drive north to Chicago for this auspicious, not to say amazin', occasion.
The Mets dream he is the second coming of Doc Gooden, a 6-foot-3-inch, 200-pound right-hander with a close-cropped haircut and a sizzling fastball who could create excitement for a team that seems to have had a sign like this over its gates in recent years: "Abandon Hope, All Ye Who Enter Here."


Parks Still Belong To the People
To the Editor:
Your July 9 news article describing how volunteers are rejuvenating Riverside Park on Manhattan's Upper West Side states that nearby residents are putting in this effort though the park "doesn't belong to them."


Onnie Lee Logan, 85, Midwife Whose 'Motherwit' Drew Praise
Onnie Lee Logan, the Alabama midwife who used what she called her God-given motherwit to deliver hundreds of babies before her 1989 autobiography made her a favorite in feminist circles, died on Tuesday at the Mobile Infirmary in Mobile, Ala.
By her own reckoning she was about 85.
When she was born "somewhere about 1910," she once noted, midwives in rural Alabama weren't overly scrupulous about filing birth records for the grandchildren of slaves.

To the Editor:
Your headline says "H.M.O.'s Refusing Emergency Claims, Hospitals Assert" (front page, July 9), but your article says "H.M.O.'s are increasingly denying claims for care provided in hospital emergency rooms." That confusion is the crux of the problem.
Much of the care provided in emergency rooms is not emergency care.


Preparing for a Strike


Report to Detail Errant Ways of Barings
The British Government will publish a report by the end of next week that is expected to catalogue a series of management failures at Barings P.L.C. that allowed a rogue trader to run up huge losses and cause the collapse of the venerable investment firm early this year.
The report, conducted by a group under the supervision of the Bank of England, is expected to criticize a widespread lack of controls by senior management at Barings over the activities of the trader, Nicholas W. Leeson.
Specifically, it is expected to raise questions about why senior managers did not act on clear warnings that something was amiss in the firm's Singapore futures trading operation, where Mr.
Leeson was employed.


U.S. Attorney Is Backed for a Federal Judgeship
Faith S. Hochberg, the United States Attorney for New Jersey, was recommended yesterday for the Federal bench.
The recommendation to name her a judge was sent to President Clinton by Senator Bill Bradley, who had also backed Ms.
Hochberg for her current job as the top law enforcement official in New Jersey.


International Briefs; Smith New Court In Acquisition Talks
Smith New Court P.L.C. said yesterday that it was holding talks with a "small number of parties" that could result in a takeover of one of the brokerage firm, one of Britain's largest remaining independent stockbrokers.
And this morning, The Financial Times reported that Merrill Lynch &amp; Company was in takeover negotiations with Smith New Court.
The paper said Merrill Lynch was aiming to conclude a deal within days.
Officials of Merrill Lynch could not be reached for comment last night.


Judge in Terror Trial Bars Several Defense Witnesses
The defense in the trial of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Muslim cleric charged with directing a terror-bombing conspiracy in the New York area, suffered what it called a critical blow yesterday when the judge barred defense lawyers from calling several major witnesses.
The judge, Michael B. Mukasey of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said the lawyers could not call experts on Islamic law.
The defense had hoped they would counter what it called the prosecution's distortion of Muslim concepts to incriminate Mr.
Abdel Rahman and his 10 co-defendants.


Bridge
Winning a first major regional title is a milestone in the life of any tournament player, and is usually followed by a long gap, sometimes an infinite one.
To win a second and third within the space of a week may be unique.
This feat has just been achieved by Dr.
Gerald Sosler, a vascular surgeon from Purchase, N.Y., who captured two Flight A Regional Knockout Team titles in Alexandria, Va., during the holiday weekend, and a third shortly afterward in Smithtown, L.I.
On the diagramed deal he held the South hand and climbed optimistically to six no-trump, as did the opposing team.
The alternative of six hearts depends in principle on a favorable heart split, which is against the odds.
Six no-trump, like six clubs, has a fair chance in the absence of a diamond lead, and opening leaders rarely attack dummy's first-bid suit.


Allies of Aristide Appear Big Winners in the Haitian Elections
Partial results from Haiti's elections on June 25 indicate that candidates from Lavalas, the party most closely allied to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, were the overwhelming victors.
Competing for more than 2,000 offices, Lavalas candidates won 16 of 83 seats in the lower house and 5 of 18 in the upper house.
While most races will require runoffs in August, Lavalas candidates are far ahead in the majority of them.


President's Memorandum on Religious Expression in Schools
Following is President Clinton's memorandum to Attorney General Janet Reno and Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley about religious expression in public schools:
Religious freedom is perhaps the most precious of all American liberties -- called by many our "first freedom." Many of the first European settlers in North America sought refuge from religious persecution in their native countries.
Since that time, people of faith and religious institutions have played a central role in the history of this nation.
In the First Amendment, our Bill of Rights recognizes the twin pillars of religious liberty: the constitutional protection for the free exercise of religion, and the constitutional prohibition on the establishment of religion by the state.
Our nation's founders knew that religion helps to give our people the character without which a democracy can not survive.
Our founders also recognized the need for a space of freedom between government and the people -- that the government must not be permitted to coerce the conscience of any individual or group.


County Losing Official Hired To Guide It In Bankruptcy
William J. Popejoy, the business-minded chief executive of Orange County, resigned today, voicing discouragement with the political concerns that may have contributed to the defeat of a sales-tax measure he had backed to rescue the county from bankruptcy.
Mr.
Popejoy, 56, who had signed on earlier this year as a volunteer to help lead the county back to fiscal health, said in a statement that he could not accept restrictions imposed on him by the five-member Board of Supervisors after voters rejected the half-cent tax increase on June 27.


An Editorial Provokes A Debate on Intermarriage; Jewish Weekly Touches a Nerve in Connecticut
For nine years, Cheryl Krause has struggled to feel comfortable in the Jewish world of her husband and to provide a Jewish home for their two children.
Mrs.
Krause, a Presbyterian, has studied the Torah with a rabbi, played the role of a matzoh in a Passover play and prepared seders for her in-laws. ("Much tougher than Christmas dinner," she said.) It is a point of pride that her 4-year-old son, Seth, built a sand castle on the beach the other day and began to re-enact the Jews' escape from slavery in ancient Egypt, chanting, "Let my people go."


Comptroller Warns of Pitfalls in Budget
Financial gimmicks, last-minute spending and new tax cuts in the state budget will force significant shortfalls in the coming years, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall warned in a report released today appraising the new state budget.
Echoing concerns of other fiscal monitors, Mr.
McCall, a Democrat, lashed out especially hard at an overreliance on so-called one-shots, the one-time sources of revenue that he said made up $1.1 billion of the $33.1 billion spending plan.


Five Days of a Heat Wave


Serbs Start Moving Muslims Out of Captured Territory
Bosnian Serb forces seized the last United Nations stronghold in a "safe area" of eastern Bosnia today, along with as many as 40,000 civilian refugees, and swiftly began busing the women, children and elderly toward Bosnian Government territory.
In what has been a ritual of previous "ethnic cleansing" campaigns to rid territories of Muslim populations, the Bosnian Serbs separated the military-age men from the refugees and said they would be "screened for war crimes," a United Nations spokesman here said.

Subsidizing the Farm Bureaucracy
Let's permit welfare recipients to form neighborhood committees and run their own welfare programs.
We'll make the committees elective, but only people in the neighborhood who receive or qualify for welfare checks will be able to vote for members.
Federal taxpayers will pick up the tab.
The committees and the bureaucrats who work for them will process all the claims and write all the checks.
If questions of fraud or abuse arise, we'll let committee members investigate their neighbors.


Test Scores Penalize Minority Student Athletes
To the Editor:
Proponents of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Proposition 48, an initial athletic eligibility requirement that relies heavily on standardized test scores, point to a recent association study of graduation rates as proof of the effectiveness of the rule (editorial, July 7).


Diner's Journal
From Japan, Kaiseki
Early in the evening the 32 seats at Katana are filled mostly with Japanese, but as the new restaurant's SoHo neighbors begin to wander in, the crowd changes and becomes very young and very hip.
This is oddly dislocating, for this new venture by Brad Kelley (a partner in the restaurant Kelley &amp; Ping) is entirely traditional.
The intimate, understated room feels very much like a small restaurant in Kyoto where chefs turn out elegant tidbits.
The emphasis is on kaiseki, a formal cuisine associated with the tea ceremony.
While there is an a la carte menu, the waiters urge you to try one of the set dinners at $30 to $60.
These typically begin with a small salad or sashimi, progress to tempura, then grilled fish, vegetables, soup and dessert.


Merck's Drug for Bone Weakness Gets F.D.A. Backing
A new drug from Merck &amp; Company for treatment of osteoporosis, or bone deterioration in older people, was recommended yesterday for approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
Analysts said final approval of the drug, Fosamax, could come by the end of the year.
The favorable findings by two F.D.A. scientific advisory panels pushed up the prices of drug stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.
Separately, another F.D.A. panel recommended approval for sales without a prescription of a milder version of the ulcer treatment Zantac, which is the world's largest-selling drug.


Abroad at Home; Weakness As Policy
From time to time, over the years since 1945, international security experts have speculated on what the world would be like without American leadership.
Now they know.
The fall of Srebrenica to the Bosnian Serb aggressors is a signal event in world politics.
It is a devastating humiliation of the United Nations.
It calls into question the future of the North Atlantic alliance.
But most of all it points to the vacuum of leadership in the White House.


World News Briefs; Britain Begins a Test Of New War-Crimes Law
In the first test of a 1991 law giving them broad powers to prosecute suspected war criminals, the British authorities have arrested an 84-year-old man and charged him with killing four Jews in Nazi-occupied Byelorussia during World War II.
The man, Szymon Serafinowicz, is accused of committing the murders in 1941 and 1942, when, the authorities said, he was working as a local police official in what is now Belarus, an independent republic since the breakup of the Soviet Union.


In New Jersey, Nature in Abstract and a Prison Cell
Summer is the traditional down time for the art world, but New Jersey museums are offering some surprisingly intense shows.
They include a retrospective of visionary paintings by a reclusive American artist, a multimedia storefront installation on family ties by one of our most impressive Puerto Rican artists and an intergenerational homage to a firebrand political leader whom many people consider a martyr.
Montclair
Anyone lucky enough to have caught the "Spiritual in Art" exhibition in Los Angeles in 1987 may remember an odd, luminous semi-abstract painting by Agnes Pelton (1881-1961).
Titled "White Fire," it suggested stars or eyes glowing from beneath a thin stream of falling water.
It was the only work by Pelton in the show (there were six by her near-contemporary Georgia O'Keeffe), and few have been exhibited since.

Test Scores Penalize Minority Student Athletes; No National Exam
To the Editor:
Re your July 6 news article on a proposed national test for high school students: The intent is to create an educational system that would motivate students to study by having their academic future based on a national exam.
If a student is not preparing for higher education, there is little need to study in school since low grades and poor attendance could easily result in a high school or general equivalency diploma.


Sports of The Times; Devils' Pact Not Exactly A Done Deal
THE Devils' deal to stay in New Jersey appears to be more of a truce than a treaty.
Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the National Hockey League, opened yesterday's news conference by announcing that the Devils will remain in the Meadowlands for "at least the next 12 years," but by the time other voices had been heard and questioned, listeners weren't sure if the Stanley Cup champions would be here for more than 12 months.


Lenox Journal; Wharton Legacy? For Now, A Fight
Looking back from Paris in the 1930's, Edith Wharton wrote longingly of her life in the Berkshires shortly after the turn of the century.
The European-style estate she built here in 1902 had given her "country cares and joys," she wrote, "the companionship of a few dear friends, and the freedom from trivial obligations which was necessary if I was to go on with my writing."


The Panic And Perils Of Making Movies
"Living in Oblivion" was shown as part of this year's New Directors/ New Films series.
Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 17.
The film opens today in Manhattan.
"Living in Oblivion" is Tom DiCillo's wonderfully funny behind-the-scenes look at the perils of film making, no-budget style.
While he nominally presents the directing process as a series of hellish travails, Mr.
DiCillo captures such delicious mischief that his indictment becomes a valentine.

2d Highest Budget Official In Connecticut Resigns
Just seven months after becoming the most prominent Democrat in a new Republican administration, Lorraine M. Aronson resigned today as the state's second-ranking budget official to take a high-level post at the University of Connecticut.
Ms.
Aronson was considered by many to be one of the state's most knowledgeable policy makers and is the first high ranking official to leave the service of Gov.
John G. Rowland.
Her departure from the Office of Policy and Management so soon may cast a shadow over the recently approved state budget.


Boy Held in Rape Is Suspect in 9 Robberies
A 15-year-old Brooklyn boy has been arrested and charged with the rape and robbery of a 20-year-old woman and two other armed robberies in central Brooklyn on Wednesday, and the police said they were investigating whether he was connected to seven other muggings in the area over the last few weeks.
The suspect, Pedro Castellano, of 929 Newkirk Avenue, was charged with rape, sodomy, robbery and criminal possession of a weapon, Officer Debra Kearns, a police spokeswoman, said yesterday.


Simon Geller, 75; Ran Radio Station All by Himself
Simon Geller, who operated a one-man classical music station in Gloucester, Mass., for a quarter-century and battled with the F.C.C. to keep it, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Rockville, Md.
He was 75 and lived in Rockville.
Mr.
Geller was born in Lowell, Mass.
After working in radio in New Jersey, he moved to Gloucester in 1964 because, he told a reporter, it was the biggest town on the East Coast without a radio station.
For the next 24 years he broadcast classical recordings on WVCA-FM, 13 hours a day, 7 days a week, offering brief descriptions of the music before playing a selection and soliciting money once every hour.
The radio's call letters stood for "Voice of Cape Ann," and the phrase became attached to Mr.
Geller himself.


Boat Capsizes In East River; 38 Are Saved
A 50-foot cruise boat capsized in the East River near midtown Manhattan last night, sending at least 38 passengers and crew members into the water, where they clung to the overturned boat or clambered into a life raft before being scooped up by the Coast Guard, the police and other rescuers.
By 1 A.M., the authorities said they believed that all the passengers aboard the boat, the Other Office, had been safely accounted for.
But eight United States Coast Guard and police boats were still searching the river, up to East 116th Street, where the pleasure craft had been towed after overturning near East 34th Street.

Commuters Try to Reserve Parking Space
While negotiators for the Metro-North Railroad and representatives of 17 unions bargained toward a strike deadline of 12:01 A.M. on Sunday, some commuters were preparing for the worst by trying to reserve parking space in Manhattan lots and garages.
Operators of several parking businesses said yesterday that they had received calls from motorists anticipating a walkout on the rail line, which carries some 100,000 passengers daily.
At the same time, Metro-North has issued contingency plans involving buses, subways, car pooling and related advice.

Gingrich: Speaker, Author -- But King of the Jungle?
At the seventh hour, the Speaker came forth to protect the rhinoceros and the tiger and the elephant.
The Interior Department budget was being slashed through the day by multimillion-dollar bites in a long, often dreary session when a buzz suddenly shook the House floor.
Speaker Newt Gingrich had indeed emerged from the inner sanctum of leadership, where the budget-cutting plan was being kept on schedule, to make a rare floor appearance and speak up for some exotic animals, asking the members to spare one of the tinier budget items tagged for extinction.

In America; Renewing Black America
The clearest message to emerge from this week's N.A.A.C.P. convention in Minneapolis was that African-Americans will have to look elsewhere for the sophisticated leadership that is desperately needed to guide a besieged black population through increasingly harrowing times.
Myrlie Evers-Williams, the new chairwoman, is a decent and well-meaning person, but her organization is old and wounded and deeply in debt.
With the evil turn that American politics has taken, the outlook for much of black America is as precarious as that of a dinghy in a hurricane.
There is no time to wait for the N.A.A.C.P. to get its act together.


G.O.P. Pushes Query On Idaho Standoff
Republican lawmakers intensified their demands today for a Congressional investigation into the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 1992 standoff with a white separatist in Idaho after a veteran agent was suspended as part of the Justice Department's inquiry into whether important internal documents related to the siege were destroyed.
Senators Larry E. Craig of Idaho and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said that hearings on the Idaho incident should be held soon.
"We sit on a powder keg, with a lot of anxiety and anger welling up across the country as to excessive action by the Federal Government," said Mr.
Specter, a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination.
He said Congress had been "derelict" in failing to hold such hearings.


Decision to Stay in New Jersey Has Players' Approval
From New Jersey to Minnesota to western Canada, Devils players were delighted yesterday to hear that the Stanley Cup championship banner will be raised in East Rutherford, N.J.
"This was obviously out of the players' hands, but I'm glad we're staying," said Jimmy Dowd, the center and only New Jersey native to ever play for the team.

2 Indicted in Counselor's Death
It has been almost six months since Robert Heavey died after he was injured during a disturbance at the Morris County Youth Center, where he was a part-time counselor.
Mr.
Heavey was punched above the eye during a Jan. 3 melee.
He later slipped into a coma.
Two youths who were being held in the center on robbery charges at the time of the melee were indicted yesterday in Mr.
Heavey's death.
Kevin Harrington and Delfon Robins face life sentences.


Library Discovery Turns A Legend Into Reality
The story has assumed almost mythic proportions among law professors and students: how in 1957, the eminent Oxford legal scholar H. L. A. Hart threatened to withdraw his article on law and morality from the Harvard Law Review unless the editors stopped cutting swaths from it.
But the story was unproven.
Now, a doctoral student has found a letter and a response tucked away in the Harvard University Law School library that shows that the story was no myth.

R. E. Goldburg, 78, Connecticut Rabbi
Rabbi Robert E. Goldburg, the former spiritual leader of Congregation Mishkan Israel in Hamden, Conn., died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center.
He was 78 and lived in Manhattan, where he moved from Hamden after retiring in 1982.
The cause was cancer, said Rabbi Herbert N. Brockman, who now heads Mishkan Israel, New England's oldest continuous synagogue.


High Proportion of AIDS Cases
The number of pediatric AIDS cases in Newark has risen from 59 to 135 over the last six years, while during the same period, the proportion of black children with the disease has increased from 76.2 percent to 83.7 percent, the Black Leadership Commission on AIDS reported yesterday.
Blacks constitute 55 percent of Newark's population, yet make up 84 percent of the people with AIDS.


Farm Boy Finding Romance in the Big City
The time-honored image of a farm boy, his head filled with romantic dreams, who moves to the big city to make them come true, may have lost much of its currency in the age of grunge rock.
But as long as there are cabaret singers like Phillip Officer, who opened a one-month engagement at Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel (54 West 44th Street, Manhattan) on Tuesday evening, that image should remain more than a relic of a more innocent and optimistic time.
Most of the songs in Mr.
Officer's show, "Moonlight Serenade: Songs of a Summer Night," are connected to a picture the singer paints of himself as a youth growing up in a farm community in the middle of Missouri.
On hot summer nights, he says, he used to go outdoors and count the stars.


U.S. Says It Warned Wu About Earlier Trip to China
The State Department urged Harry Wu, the human rights advocate, not to travel to China last year after he was naturalized as an American citizen, warning that he might be arrested for his undercover research into Chinese forced labor camps, State Department officials said today.
In addition, J. Stapleton Roy, who recently left his post as the American Ambassador to Beijing, expressed concern that the name on Mr.
Wu's American passport, Peter H. Wu, could lead Chinese authorities into thinking that Mr.
Wu was trying to deceive the Chinese Government and that the United States could mistakenly be seen as a witting accomplice, the officials said.


Stock Market Drifts in Lackluster Trading
A day after hitting record levels, the stock market drifted yesterday in lackluster trading.
The three leading averages finished at new highs, but not by much.
On the other hand, declining issues exceeded advancing stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,230 to 1,044.


Facing High-Tech Issues, New Patents Chief Is Reinventing a Staid Agency
If control of the rights to intellectual property, technological innovation and pure invention is to be a legal battleground of the 21st century, then Bruce Lehman might be called the United States' field general.
As the head of the Patent and Trademark Office, Mr.
Lehman realizes that most of the nation may not regard his obscure agency as pivotal to the success of American industry in a global, increasingly high-tech economy.
But he does, and he is determined to use his stewardship of that office to reshape patent laws that have prevailed since the Civil War.

France Asks Allied Forces to Help Hold 'Safe Areas'
France called on the United States and Britain today to join in military operations to save other United Nations-designated "safe zones" in Bosnia from the fate of Srebrenica, which Bosnian Serb forces overran practically without a fight on Wednesday.
A statement from President Jacques Chirac's office said that if France's partners were not ready to commit their forces to protecting the besieged enclaves, France it would "draw all the consequences" and pull its 4,000 peacekeepers out of Bosnia.


Princeton Has a New Head Coach, Again
Princeton University yesterday signed LIZ FEELY, who turned around the Colgate program, to a four-year contract -- the second head coach the university has hired in less than a month.
After signing a contract on June 22, JULIE PLANK stepped down on June 30.
Three years ago, Feely, 31, inherited a Colgate team that had gone 5-22.
Colgate's 9-5 record last year was the best Patriot League record in the program's history.

Democrat Won't Rule Out Sharing Power in Myanmar
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the newly freed opposition leader, said today that she did not rule out a transitional government in which the Burmese military shared political power with civilians, insisting that she had a "soft spot" for the military even though it held her under house arrest for nearly six years.
Choosing her words carefully in an attempt to convince the military of her willingness to compromise, Mrs.
Aung San Suu Kyi (pronounced awng sahn su chee) made clear in an interview that her goal remained a civilian-run democratic government in Myanmar, formerly Burma, but that in the meantime she might be open to a power-sharing arrangement with her former jailers.

Nashville Still Seeks Team
At least for now, the agreement between the Devils and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority puts an end to speculation that the Devils would decamp next season for Nashville, which had been luring the team with a promise of a new state-of-the-art arena and sweeteners such as a $20 million relocation bonus.
Mayor Philip Bredesen of Nashville said: "I'm not going to tell you I don't want the Stanley Cup champions playing here, but I'm more convinced than ever that we will have a team in a couple of years."


Nomination Starts Debate On Bigotry
A City Council hearing on the reappointment of a controversial Bronx minister to the police Civilian Complaint Review Board erupted into a raucous debate on the nature of bigotry yesterday.
Council members angrily argued over which forms of prejudice were worse.
The debate was sparked by remarks critical of homosexuality that the minister, the Rev.
Ruben Diaz, has made.


Argentina Is Tough Test For U.S.
Hoping to show that its conquest of the United States Cup last month was not simply a fluke, the United States national team will try to secure a spot in the quarterfinals of the America Cup Friday night when it takes on the tournament favorite, Argentina, in the final match of the first round.
The United States team, which began the tournament strongly with a 2-1 victory over Chile last Saturday, lost to Bolivia, 1-0, on Tuesday after making silly mistakes and failing to recover from a weak start.


Simpson Judge Bars Use Of Drug-Killing Theory
Judge Lance A. Ito today barred O. J. Simpson's lawyers from advancing their theory, which he called "highly speculative," that Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman were killed by drug dealers whose real target was Faye Resnick, Mrs.
Simpson's friend and, for a time, an admitted cocaine user.
Under a 1986 ruling by the California Supreme Court, evidence that a third party killed someone cannot be used without "direct or circumstantial evidence" tying that person to the crime.
In curbing the upcoming testimony of Christian Reichardt, a Beverly Hills chiropractor and Ms.
Resnick's former fiance, Judge Ito said the defense had furnished no such evidence.


The Lens of the Beholder: 60 Years of Photographing the Soviet Empire
It would be hard to find anyone who has seen more of this cruel century than Yevgeny Khaldei.
Born with the Russian Revolution in 1917, he was shot the next year during a pogrom against the Jews in his Ukrainian village when a bullet passed through his mother and lodged in his chest.
She died; so did her mother and the three friends sitting with them at the kitchen table.
The boy's father, beaten beyond recognition, died two months later.


Briles-Hinton Takes the Lead And Sets Mark
A mountain was over their shoulders, a deer was in front of the 12th tee and a 16-year-old invaded the leader board.
The 50th United States Women's Open met the wilderness today, and the results were minor gusts, a severe rough, sloping greens and, out of the blue, a course record score of 66.
Jill Briles-Hinton, who sneaked her miniature schnauzers into her hotel room, played miniature golf here, too.
Her putting on the Broadmoor Resort's East course was deadeye, and her crawling "miracle" uphill birdie putt on the 18th hole landed her a four-under-par 66 and the first-round lead.

F.C.C. Proposes Dual Use For One Part of Airwaves
The Federal Communications Commission proposed rules today that would allow new global satellite communications systems to share a part of the airwaves with a technology for transmitting dozens of television channels over microwave frequencies.
The new rules would essentially settle a dispute between businesses that want the same segment of the radio spectrum for two different technologies: a fleet of small satellites that would provide voice and video services anywhere in the world, and a new "wireless cable" technology that could be a potential rival to existing cable television and local telephone services.


Hudson Valley Crop: Portraits and di Suvero
In the Hudson Valley this summer is a range of art, from Minimalist sculptures at Bard College to contemporary Mexican photographs in Purchase to a rambunctious show of portraits at the Hudson River Museum.
This is also the summer that the sculptor Mark di Suvero was back at the Storm King Art Center in Mountainville.
Mountainville
It seems that Mark di Suvero's sculptures are everywhere lately.
A half-dozen of them are parked along the Grand Canal in Venice, their jutting steel beams neatly echoing the masts of boats in the lagoon.
Mr. di Suvero's work filled the Gagosian Gallery in SoHo this spring.
And now at the STORM KING ART CENTER , which has had a long and productive relationship with him, Mr. di Suvero has a major exhibition of small, medium and large works from the last dozen or so years, most of them since his 1985 show at Storm King.


Producer Prices Fell In June
The nation's producers received slightly lower prices for finished goods in June, the second consecutive month with no inflation at the last stage before the goods reach consumers, Labor Department figures showed today.
Economists said this latest report of price stability, which was somewhat better than expected, reinforced the decision by the Federal Reserve last week to ease monetary policy to insure against the economic slowdown's degenerating into recession.
And it suggests that there is more leeway now for the Fed to cut rates further in the months ahead.

The Speaker Meets Generation X


A Rainbow Coalition In 'Ceiling'
SOMETHING usually fizzles when a classical composer tries to tame the wild beasts of pop.
Once domesticated, they lose their spirit.
An academic self-consciousness and reserve mute their colors and compromise their spontaneity.
They become obedient, well-behaved pets that can safely be let loose in a concert hall without upsetting (or exciting) anybody.
John Adams's music for "I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky," a dramatic suite of 22 songs at the John Jay Theater, is the latest example.
Although the score ranges across the musical galaxy, its uneasy blend of Minimalism with pop, gospel, blues and jazz is too cerebral and cautious to catch fire.
Mr.
Adams shows that he can write a coherent pop melody, but his music, scored for voices and an eight-member pop-jazz ensemble, has little in common with the tough, embattled sounds and attitudes of contemporary pop.
Instead of Pearl Jam, Tupac Shakur or TLC, think of a more intricate but anemic 90's update of "Hair."

Invitation To Strike:
With the deadline for a strike against the Metro-North Railroad looming, the railroad's workers appear to have their backs against a wall of inflexible management demands and the threat of a harsh political backlash if they walk off their jobs.
The last-minute negotiating differs from that of most labor confrontations.
The specter of a Metro-North strike, which would create a steamy midsummer ordeal for more than 100,000 commuters in Westchester and Rockland counties and southwestern Connecticut, is being raised as much by management as by the railroad's unions.

On Long Island, a Mix of Styles and Subjects
Long Island's stock of summer exhibitions should improve in about 48 hours.
On Sunday, the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton opens "Face Value: American Portraits," an examination of the last 100 years of portraiture, with more than 75 works by artists ranging from William Merritt Chase to Lyle Ashton Harris.
In the meantime, the island's art pickings are a little slimmer than in years past, though highly diverse in both form and subject.
Roslyn Harbor
The most densely packed of the shows is, hands down, "La Belle Epoque" at the NASSAU COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART .
This multimedia presentation takes what might be called the cornucopia approach to exhibition planning.
It is an unfocused if intermittently rewarding celebration of French art and design from 1870 to 1914, an era of tremendous wealth, opulence and innovation, when both the haute bourgeoisie and the demi-monde emerged as distinct and occasionally overlapping spheres.


Threat, and Resolve to Spend, In Debate on Capital's Finances
Hardly a day passes that somewhere in the nation's capital local officials are not wrangling over the city's financial crisis.
But today was unusual for the number of people involved.
While the city's new financial control board discussed future budgets at its first public hearing, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. and a leading House Republican, James T. Walsh of Syracuse, argued over the current budget, with Mr.
Walsh suggesting that Mr.
Barry could face Federal prosecution for overspending.

Eight of the nation's snappiest sprinters were entered yesterday in the summer's richest sprint, tomorrow's $300,000 De Francis Memorial Dash at Laurel race track in Maryland, a race that will cast a long shadow toward the Breeders' Cup Sprint in November.
They do not include Soviet Problem, who is injured, or Cherokee Run, last year's sprint champion, who is coming back from an injury.
But they do include several of the sprinters likely to compete when the Breeders' Cup is run at Belmont Park on Oct. 28, notably Lite the Fuse, who has raced so far only in New York, and Commanche Trail, the onetime "rabbit" of the star-filled barn of D. Wayne Lukas.

The Discovery and its crew of three men and two women bolted from a launching pad into a bright Florida sun at 9:41 A.M. after a 55-second delay because of concerns about a radio receiver on the shuttle's fuel tank.

The United Nations reported that the 79 Ukrainian soldiers stationed in the Zepa pocket came under Bosnian Serb artillery fire, and the Serbian commanders told the Ukranians they should prepare to leave.

Graham to Get Two-Year Deal With Giants
Giants quarterback Kent Graham is among the best backups in the game and could probably start for a number of teams.
The Giants have always thought highly of him.
They must, because the team is prepared to sign Graham to a contract that could make him one of the highest-paid backups in the National Football League.
According to several people familiar with the situation, Graham will soon sign a two-year deal that will pay him an average of $1.1 million a year, barring any last-minute snags.
That puts him behind, in financial terms, only two other backups -- Chicago's Steve Walsh and Miami's Bernie Kosar.


Perils of a Big Name, And Worse, a Big Head
Short, bald and grumpy, Michel Blanc looks like an unlikely candidate for suffering the pitfalls of fame.
But in "Grosse Fatigue," his enjoyably spiteful comedy about celebrity, Mr.
Blanc nonetheless places himself at the center of a flashbulb-popping maelstrom.
With an outlook just Woody Allen-ish enough to register the proper chagrin, Mr.
Blanc (best known to American audiences for his roles in "Menage" and "Monsieur Hire") casts a chilly eye upon the absurdities of stardom.
And if you've ever wondered how Gerard Depardieu manages to make so many films, Mr.
Blanc has an interesting answer.
It has to do with look-alikes.
In a convoluted plot that sometimes hamstrings "Gross Fatigue," which opened on Wednesday, Mr.
Blanc, playing himself, finds a doppelganger is out to ruin him.
The double is as sleazy as the real Mr.
Blanc is self-importantly solemn.
And while the real Mr.
Blanc languishes at home in suitable movie-star fashion (he's first seen in a silk dressing gown and slippers), the faker makes hay.


Other Issues Overshadow Announcement of Drop in Crime Rate
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner William J. Bratton met with reporters yesterday to announce officially the steepest drop in crime in New York City history.
But with the news of the 31 percent drop in murder and the 22 percent drop in robbery in the first half of the year already out since the weekend, the event was dominated by other issues -- including a testy encounter between the Police Commissioner and some Bronx residents on Tuesday and persistent reports of continuing tensions between the Mayor and Mr.
Bratton.
Mr.
Bratton lectured reporters, saying that their speculation about his relationship with Mr.

A Restoration Comedy With Sex Set to Music
Nothing is funnier than sex, if you can avoid being scorched.
That's one of the assumptions of William Wycherley's Restoration comedy "The Country Wife," whose central character, Horner, poses as a castrato, the better to seduce his friends' wives and lovers.
In "Lust," a musical adaptation of the play at the John Houseman Theater that is as blunt as its title, sex is depicted as flailing, farcical burlesque.
The dialogue rains double-entendres.
Parted legs fly out from behind closed curtains.
And copulating couples give a cartoonishly lascivious spin to their quasi-operatic duets.

He had been in ill health for a number of years, said David M. Lafrennie, a spokesman for Lego Systems Inc. in Enfield, Conn., a unit of the Lego business empire, which is based in Billund.

House Panel to Draft Bill Requiring AIDS Tests of Newborns
Despite heavy opposition from medical groups and advocates for people with AIDS, leaders of the House Commerce Committee said today that they had agreed to draft bipartisan legislation that would require newborns to be tested for the virus that causes AIDS unless their mothers had been tested in pregnancy.
The agreement, announced during a committee vote on Federal AIDS financing, heightens the chance that Congress will approve a bill requiring states for the first time to conduct tests on some newborns for the virus, H.I.V.
The Federal Government would finance the testing.

13-Year-Old Pleads Not Guilty
A 13-year-old boy pleaded not guilty in Family Court yesterday to strangling a 3-year-old girl who would not stop crying.
Carmen Messano, the Hudson County Prosecutor, said it appeared that the girl, Chantel Cuffee, was sleeping in the boy's room Tuesday night, when the strangling occurred, because the teen-ager's older sister was her baby sitter.

"He likes to swing the bat."

Paris Journal; A Breath of Fresh Air? Don't Stroll by the Seine
It has been one of France's best-kept secrets but the painful truth is out: Paris, the capital of food, fashion and fragrance, a civilized island in a deteriorating world, has joined the ranks of the polluted cities.
Pollution-monitoring equipment around the city has been showing high ozone readings for two weeks now.
But today, all of Paris heard a shocking warning when the Environment Ministry told residents for the first time ever "not to use their cars except in absolute emergencies."


2 Groups of Physicists Produce Matter That Einstein Postulated
By chilling a cloud of atoms to a temperature barely above absolute zero, scientists at a Colorado laboratory have at last created a bizarre type of matter that had eluded experimenters ever since its potential existence was postulated by Albert Einstein 70 years ago.
The creation of this Bose-Einstein condensate -- named for Einstein and the Indian theorist Satyendra Nath Bose -- was hailed yesterday as the basis of a new field of research expected to explain some fundamental mysteries of atomic physics.


Yanks Drop Connors As Coach
With the Yankees struggling to reach .500 and with only two and a half months left in the season, it was only a matter of time before something changed.
Yesterday, the first head rolled, and though the players were not very happy about it, the manager appeared to endorse it.
A month ago in Detroit, Buck Showalter had gone to the wall to save the jobs of two of his coaches -- Brian Butterfield and Rick Down.
Yesterday, when the Yankees announced that pitching coach Billy Connors was being reassigned, Showalter hardly resisted the move.


Schools and Transit Get Taken for a Ride
To the Editor:
Re "Fair Funding for New York City Schools" (editorial, July 8): Who will come to the rescue of schoolchildren shortchanged by unfair state school aid formulas?
You're right to urge Gov.
George E. Pataki and the State Legislature to "jump out ahead of the courts," which will be considering a pending lawsuit to the formulas over the next several years.
But the sad reality is that the budget just adopted by the Legislature made education funding even less fair for city students.


U.S. Spells Out Antitrust Inquiry Into Microsoft
The Justice Department said today that the Microsoft Corporation might well be violating antitrust laws by including software for its new on-line network in Windows 95, its much-anticipated operating system for personal computers.
The legal brief filed today by the department stops short of charging Microsoft with any legal violations, but it provides the most solid indication yet that the Government may try to force changes in Microsoft's new program.
The brief was submitted by the Government in defense of its demand for more information from the giant software company.


Detailing Price of Cuts, Cortines Proposes Larger Class Sizes
In the first specific outline of how city budget cuts could affect classrooms next fall, Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines said yesterday that community school districts should be allowed to increase class size from 25 to 27 pupils and to shorten the school day in the city's elementary schools.
He also said districts should have the option of eliminating aides now required in all kindergartens and to increase the size of bilingual classes to 20 students, from the current 15.

Mets fans itching to watch Jason Isringhausen's pitching debut Monday night in Chicago against the Cubs will have to be satisfied with the radio call.
Rather than airing on WWOR-TV/Channel 9 or SportsChannel, the Mets' TV homes, the game is being telecast by ABC.
All 13 games that night (including the White Sox-Yankees) are in ABC's realm, and it will beam each of them to their areas of natural interest.

Some Songs of the Endlessly Renewed Seduction
Barry White says the sweetest things.
"You're my everything." "I'll take good care of you." "I've never felt like this." "Forever and ever, going to see you through." He says them in a deep baritone croon or a deeper bass recitation, like someone pouring massage oil on troubled waters.
For the audience on Wednesday night at the Paramount -- mostly nuzzling couples and groups of women -- it was the soothing, virile sound of an endlessly renewed seduction.
At the Paramount, where Mr.
White is to perform tonight and tomorrow, he set out to charm the audience with come-ons customized for New York.
He recalled appearing in the same room when it was the Felt Forum; he thanked New York for being the first city to make "Love's Theme" by his Love Unlimited Orchestra a No. 1 song in 1973.


Muslims Tell of Atrocities in Bosnian Town
Thousands of stunned Muslim refugees streamed into this town in northern Bosnia today, telling of bodies left hanging from trees and littering the street after the Bosnian Serb conquest of the "safe area" of Srebrenica.
Busloads of refugees, many with just the clothes on their backs, continued to arrive late into the night.
They camped under a full moon on mosquito-infested fields near the Tuzla airport, trying to come to grips with their sudden losses.


'Sting' on Internet Leads to a Child Sex Case
In a case involving child pornography, the Internet and a self-appointed enforcer whom one critical defense lawyer calls an "electronic vigilante," a Nevada man is facing prison for crossing state lines with the intention of having sex with a 14-year-old girl he had met on a popular computer network.
The 14-year-old was really a private investigator in Milwaukee who, Federal prosecutors say, had set up the ruse because she was upset with the amount of sex-related material she had found on the Internet.


Guilty Plea in Tape Copying
A man who mass-produced bootlegged videotapes of hit movies like "Jurassic Park," "The Lion King" and "The Flintstones" in the basement of a home in Nutley pleaded guilty in Federal District Court yesterday to felony copy infringement.
The authorities said Nedal Yousef Rasheed made more than 1,000 illegal videotapes a day and earned more than $5,000 a month selling them on the streets of Newark and New York.
He agreed to turn in the tapes along with the 52 videocassette recorders he used to make the illegal copies.
TERRY PRISTIN


Developer and Creditor Bid for Olympia &amp; York U.S.A.
A leading real estate developer and the largest creditor of Olympia &amp; York U.S.A. made an unsolicited bid yesterday to gain control of the troubled real estate concern, whose 14-million-square-foot portfolio includes a number of prime Manhattan properties, including the World Financial Center.
The offer to recapitalize and reorganize Olympia &amp; York U.S.A. was made by a group that includes an affiliate of Tishman Speyer Properties Inc. and Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund L.P., which is controlled by the financier Leon Black.


He's a Prisoner, the Least of His Worries
Jon Voight, a fine actor whose film credits include acclaimed performances in "Midnight Cowboy," "Coming Home" and "Runaway Train," could use a good movie at this stage of his career.
"Convict Cowboy," Sunday's Showtime "original movie" out of MGM, isn't it.
Looking lean and tough, Mr.
Voight plays Ry Weston, a lifer at the Brownwood State Prison in Montana.
Once a star in professional rodeo, Ry killed a man in a drunken brawl.
Now keeping mostly to himself, he runs the prison's profitable ranch and, keeping the warden (Ben Gazzara) especially happy, he is the reigning champion of the prison rodeo circuit.


OTB Posts Profit
After years of losses caused by inflated payrolls, antiquated technology and unappealing betting parlors, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that his management team had started to turn the Offtrack Betting Corporation around.


For Once, All Falls In Place For Mets
One game cannot erase the miserable first half of the season the Mets endured.
But if they are to earn some respect before the summer is over, they have to start somewhere.
Maybe last night was that start.
Everything that had been so elusive seemed to come easily against the Colorado Rockies at Shea Stadium.
The Mets got quality pitching from starter Bobby Jones, who ended a personal four-game losing streak, and added clutch hitting, great defense and a couple of lucky breaks to beat the National League West leaders, 4-2, in the first game of a four-game series.

"EVERYBODY knows me," Herb Sherry was saying.
"It happens everywhere I go. I'm playing tennis. I'm introduced to this guy. I say my name's Herb Sherry. He says: 'Herb Sherry, the band leader?' "
He was having lunch at the local Hilton, his summer home.
But you would not call it a vacation.
At 71, after 40 years of leading the Herb Sherry Orchestras, the man cannot stop working.
On a day when the sun can melt the sidewalk, he is dressed in a silk dress shirt and trousers.
He is holed up in an office in the hotel's executive suite, drumming up deals.
"You want a band? What do you need?"


Inside Art
Expensive in Tokyo
Ever since the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo opened four months ago, it has been trying to get as much attention as, say, the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris or the Tate Gallery of Modern Art in London, which has already had a flurry of publicity even though it is not scheduled to open until 2000.
Unfortunately, most of the attention has been critical.
The city-run institution is Tokyo's first contemporary-art museum, and the cost has been astronomical.
Its six-story, 330,000-square-foot building, designed by Takahito Yanagisawa, a local architect, cost $481 million.
And its location, about 40 minutes by car from downtown Tokyo, is too out of the way, experts say, to attract many visitors.

Bill Takes On Health Issue In Small Steps

Senator Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican who heads the Labor and Human Resources Committee, said in an interview that she expected the panel to approve the bill before Congress goes on vacation in August, and that she hoped for floor action this fall.

Art in Greener Pastures, Outside New York
WASN'T it Henry James who wrote about the special pleasure of visiting museums outside the big city?
The surroundings are agreeable, the distractions fewer.
There is the possibility of discovery.
James was talking about Paris, but the same applies to New York.
This summer the discoveries are out there in places like Montclair, N.J., and Yonkers.
Agnes Pelton's art is in Montclair.
An American original whose paint ings were on view at the Armory Show in 1913, Pelton died in the early 1960's.
Her luminous and intense canvases went their own way while most American art went in a different direction, so Pelton remained largely unknown and almost never seen in New York.
She is one discovery to be made.


Times Co. Expects An Increase in Profit
The New York Times Company, citing cost cutting and higher circulation and advertising prices, said yesterday that it expected to report second-quarter earnings of 43 cents to 47 cents a share.
The range of earnings exceeded the expectations of many Wall Street analysts and would be at least 34 percent higher than last year's second-quarter profit of 32 cents a share.


Death Penalty May Be Sought, Second Bombing Suspect Is Told
A lawyer for Terry L. Nichols said today that Federal prosecutors had sent him a formal notice that the Government might seek the death penalty for Mr.
Nichols on charges that he helped bomb the Federal Building here.
The United States Attorney here, Patrick M. Ryan, said in the notification that he was seeking any information that might mitigate against a death sentence, said the lawyer, Michael E. Tigar.
Justice Department procedures require such an inquiry.


Monument Intact, From Mark Morris
"L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato," the life-affirming communal celebration that Mark Morris choreographed to Handel's oratorio of the same name, had its New York premiere at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1989.
At that time, one year after it was first produced in Brussels, the work was clearly the best that Mr.
Morris had created.
The same is true today, a conclusion that does no disservice to the choreographer but validates the rightness of his magnificent enterprise.
Mr.
Morris came of age artistically with this piece.
To borrow a line from the poems by Milton in the Handel score, he found "the hidden soul of harmony" and realized a work of lasting high seriousness.


Upper East Side Residents Find That When a Rape Occurs, Numbers Mean Little
A lot of people walk in and out of the apartment building at 12 East 86th Street.
On Wednesday evening, among the tenants returning home from work, the patients visiting the ground-floor medical offices and the delivery men, there was a rapist.
He forced his way into a 17th-floor penthouse overlooking the Central Park reservoir and attacked a 24-year-old woman at knifepoint, raping her and robbing her of $400, the police said.

Glenner was a senior scientist.
Systemic senile amyloidosis is a rare disease caused by the protein amyloid, a form of which is also linked to Alzheimer's disease.

Proposal on Tobacco Gets Some White House Backing
The White House indicated today that it generally supported a landmark proposal by the Food and Drug Administration that nicotine in tobacco products be declared a drug and therefore subject to the agency's regulation.
The proposal, which the F.D.A. has asked the White House to review, was disclosed by Federal officials on Wednesday.
It would upend the Government's longstanding position that tobacco is exempt from health regulation, and could open the way, at least in theory, to broad controls over cigarette production and sales, although the drug agency has confined itself for now to modest proposals on the politically surer ground of limiting young people's access.

Executive's Visit May Decide Fate of New York Newsday
Another New York City tabloid is fighting for its life.
But this time there are no eccentric millionaires, no newsroom rebellions, no angry strikers outside the newspaper doors.
The paper, New York Newsday, has always been more sedate than its rowdier tabloid rivals, The New York Post and The Daily News.
So it seems fitting that, instead of the public brawl the other papers stage whenever they are in danger, this newspaper crisis is being played out in more somber settings: in executive sessions in board rooms and at quiet lunches.

No Slow Motion in the Tour
Nobody, least of all the Tour de France organizers, expected a speedy stage today after two tiring days of climbing in the Alps.
The official guide to the Tour -- known in French as le road book, go figure -- predicted the fastest time of 38 kilometers (23.6 miles) an hour over the 199 kilometers (123.6 miles) from the Alpine village of Bourg d'Oisans to the grimy city of St.
Etienne.
The slowest predicted time was 34 k.p.h. (21 miles per hour).


Bosnia's Human Emergency
Forty thousand men, women and children, their safety supposedly guaranteed by the United Nations Security Council, are now desperate, helpless victims of the latest Bosnian Serb offensive and the fall of Srebrenica.
Most of the women and children, along with the elderly, have been bused west to government territory.
The men, ominously, have been rounded up to be "screened for war crimes." Given the region's history of ethnic cleansing and torture camps, these captives, predominantly Muslims, must be considered in grave danger.
Arriving refugees report seeing many corpses in Srebrenica's streets.


It May Be Near Wall Street, But Not Shouting Distance
Since the days of sailing ships and mercantile princes, lower Manhattan has retained its position as the place where trade deals get done.
Companies may rise and fall, but the exchanges go on and on.
That historic link may now be challenged, with the plans announced on Wednesday by two of the oldest commodities exchanges to move to Jersey City.
The departure would cost New York 5,000 jobs, but for both sides of the Hudson, the implications go much further.

When the Pen Is Truly Mighty
Cal Ripken Jr., less than two months from breaking Lou Gehrig's streak of 2,130 consecutive games, is famous for his endurance on the baseball field.
For a less celebrated example of his stamina, consider the more than 10,000 autographs he will sign this year.
The vast majority will not be the old-fashioned face-to-face kind.
Rather, Ripken signs balls by the boxload, hundreds at a time, in his hotel room or at home, to be sold at a big profit.
A trained observer from the merchandising company makes sure there is a comfortable chair or practical table.
He lays out the proper pen.
Then, as with all athletes, he hovers, quickly checking every signature to insure that the autograph is in the "sweet spot" (where the stitching arcs together), that the ink is clear and even and that it dries properly.

There really are people who are perfect for the new Match Uptown.
Unfortunately, it took me a long time to find one.

What other restaurant gives you a "confirmation number" when you reserve a table?
Then you arrive to discover red velvet ropes across the door and a man with a clipboard checking names on the sidewalk.
"We have a sort of bar scene," he will tell you, "that interferes with the diners. So we try to keep it down."

On Voting Rights, Court Faces a Tangled Web
Thirty years after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, in a highly symbolic ceremony in the room in the Capitol where Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, the Supreme Court has issued dozens of decisions interpreting this fundamental civil rights law.
Yet the law of voting rights remains, to a surprising and unsettling degree, part of the Court's unfinished business.
That was the unspoken message of the final day of the Court's term late last month, a day on which the Justices issued an important but inconclusive decision in a Georgia redistricting case and then left for the summer with an abundance of unanswered questions still on the table about the meaning, enforcement and even constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act.


Magic Furniture and a Tiny Friend
The best reason for children to see "The Indian in the Cupboard" is illustrated by the film itself.
It features a scene in which fighting breaks out between the title American Indian and his teeny little cowboy counterpart after they happen to glimpse a violent western movie on television.
We hardly needed further proof that viewers, especially young ones, are influenced by what they see.
So here's a nice film that has nothing to do with greed, comic books or world domination.
Children should be charmed by its fantasy world, and parents will be reasonably entertained.
Based on one of a series of books by Lynne Reid Banks, "The Indian in the Cupboard" is the latest children's story to have its English setting transposed to a blander America on screen.
But the real charm of this tale has nothing to do with its backdrop and everything to do with the magic around which the story revolves.
A boy named Omri is given both a plastic American Indian and a little cupboard for his birthday.
He discovers, to his amazement, that the cupboard can bring the Indian to life.
Off goes Omri into the world of secret adventure that children love and grown-ups rarely understand.


Suspended Parole Officer Talks of Compassion's Role
A New Jersey parole officer under suspension for his supervision of Darnell Collins, the parolee who went on a killing spree last month, talked yesterday about balancing punishment and compassion when handling convicts and ex-convicts.
State officials talking about the same subject spoke mostly about punishment.
The parole officer, John Goodman, spoke for about 15 minutes at his home in Pleasantville a day after being suspended for neglect of duty in supervising Mr.
Collins, who the authorities say killed seven people in New Jersey and New York last month before being shot to death by the police in Nutley, N.J.

Report Urges New Steps to Protect Blood Supply
New steps are needed to prevent the disastrous spread of another dangerous infectious agent like H.I.V. because the ability of the nation's blood banking and public health systems to identify and guard against unknown microbes is weak, according to a report prepared for the Federal Government.
During the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the nation's public health system did not perform as well as it could have to prevent spread of the virus through transfusions of blood and blood products, said the report, by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, issued yesterday.


Japan Buys More U.S. Auto Parts
Japanese automobile manufacturers bought $19.86 billion of American-made parts and materials in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, an industry trade group said this morning.
The figure surpassed a voluntary goal of $19 billion set during President George Bush's visit to Japan in 1992, but fell substantially short of the auto industry's target for importing American parts into Japan.
Imports totaled $3.23 billion, compared with a target of $4 billion, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.

Clinton Is Scrambling to Find Way to Help U.N. in Bosnia
With its Bosnia policy under fresh assault in Europe and in Congress, the Administration searched feverishly today for ways to salvage as much of the disintegrating United Nations peacekeeping effort as possible, partly for humanitarian reasons but in large measure to avoid sending American troops to assist in a dangerous withdrawal of the peacekeeping forces.
President Clinton, whose aides and whose own instincts have told him from the start that it would be political poison to get involved in combat in the Balkans, was once again faced with difficult decisions about how much the United States would contribute to a last-ditch effort to avoid or at least delay the ultimate humiliation of complete United Nations withdrawal.


ACCORD IN HOUSE WOULD KILL FUNDS FOR ARTS BY 1997
Faced with a freshman-led mutiny, House Republican leaders agreed today to cut off all Federal funding to the National Endowment for the Arts within two years -- a year earlier than they had planned and five years ahead of the Senate's schedule.
The House, mired in a daylong debate over a bill appropriating $11.96 billion for the Interior Department for 1996, did not reach a similar agreement to shorten the life of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
But two amendments wending through the House and toward likely approval would set in law the 1997 deadline for both the arts and humanities agencies.

GOLF  Freeman Has Share of Lead in Virginia
Robin Freeman, who worked as a club pro for five years because he wasn't ready for the PGA Tour, shot a six-under-par 65 yesterday to take a share of the first-round lead in the Anheuser-Busch Golf Classic at Williamsburg, Va.
Dudley Hart and Richard Zokol also turned in 65's on the River Course of Kingsmill Golf Club, one shot better than Kirk Triplett, Jim Carter and the former U.C.L.A. teammates Scott McCarron and Duffy Waldorf.

Squatters' Rights vs. City Rights
A group of rundown tenements on Manhattan's Lower East Side lived in by squatters for years may well have benefited from their occupation.
The squatters have fixed up the city-owned buildings with their own money and sweat, securing them from drug users and criminals.
Now the buildings are a vicious battleground.
New York City is trying to clear the property and sell it to a community group committed to renovating the buildings for low-income families and returning them to the tax rolls.
The squatters are resisting, on the streets and in the courts.
The city has acted slowly and clumsily, but it is pursuing the right objective and deserves a chance to proceed with the renovation project.


Midas Is Looking For a New Agency
The Midas International Corporation has begun a review on its national account, with billings estimated at $23 million.
The Chicago office of Wells Rich Greene BDDP, which has handled the account for the last 25 years, declined an invitation to participate and resigned.
"We are in a rapidly changing advertising and marketing environment, which demands marketing strategies that reach beyond traditional advertising," E. Christian Schoenleb, vice president for marketing at Midas in Chicago, a unit of the Whitman Corporation, said yesterday.
The review was unrelated to the recent departures of three top Wells Rich executives, he added.
Midas will continue its relationships with 14 regional agencies on the local dealer portion of the account; Wells Rich had handled both the national and local portions until they were separated in 1993.


The Guns of Waco and Ruby Ridge
There is little doubt that the Federal Government contributed heavily to two of the biggest law enforcement fiascoes in recent memory.
One was the disastrous 1993 Federal raid on the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Tex.
The other was the tragic 1992 encounter between the F.B.I. and a band of white separatists at Ruby Ridge, Idaho.
It is now equally clear that official investigations into both incidents are themselves flawed.
Those in charge of these inquiries must move decisively to prevent any further erosion of credibility.
The House of Representatives will begin hearings next week into the Waco raid.
It has come to light that in the course of preparing for the hearings, Republican committee staff members enlisted weapons experts hired by the National Rifle Association to inspect a Davidian weapons arsenal held by the Texas Rangers.
The N.R.A. has little use for the F.B.I. or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, both involved in the Waco raid, and has tried for months to divert attention from the proliferation of firearms in private hands to the alleged misdeeds of Federal agents.
This misguided alliance with N.R.A.
"experts" has tainted the objectivity of the House investigation and must be terminated.


Market Place; Archer-Daniels-Midland stock is off, but some see a buy.
SHARES of Archer-Daniels-Midland have been pummeled in the last week after disclosures about an unusually broad and aggressive criminal antitrust investigation of the giant grain and soybean processor.
And many analysts have been warning of more trouble ahead for the stock.
"We suspect the stock could touch $11 or $12 before this is all over," said Bonnie Wittenburg in a bulletin issued on Tuesday from Dain Bosworth, the Minneapolis investment firm where she follows the company.


Corrections
A theater review on Wednesday about "The Tempest" at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park omitted the name of one composer of the score.
He is Carlos Valdez.
The review also misspelled the surname of the other composer.
He is Dan Moses Schreier.


Howard Learning The Ropes As a Jet
In 1993 and 1994, Erik Howard and Mike Fox played side by side as the Giants' starting defensive tackles.
Howard was a one-time Pro Bowl nose tackle.
Fox was a journeyman.
This year, when both became unrestricted free agents, a stunning event changed their football lives.
In March, with the National Football League's signing period for free agents only three days old, the Carolina Panthers signed Fox to a five-year contract worth $9 million, double what most football people thought he would command.


Remembering Hiroshima


Corrections
An article yesterday about the history of the United Nations-designated "safe areas" in Bosnia misstated the date of a request by Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for additional troops to protect them.
It was June 1993, soon after the "safe areas" were established, not June 1995.

What to Do When Only Villains Speak Well?
THE INARTICULATE SOCIETY Eloquence and Culture in America
By Tom Shachtman
296 pages.
The Free Press. $25.
It's no secret that articulate speech -- never mind old-fashioned eloquence and reasoned debate -- is in increasingly short supply.
Insults, complaints and psychobabble fill the airwaves, as television and radio talk shows spread a new gospel of hyperbole and anger.
Movies like "Dumb and Dumber" celebrate stupidity and bad taste, even as television shows like "Beavis and Butt-head" vigorously work to raise those qualities to new levels.
While politicians specialize in the art of the spin and the sound bite, lawyers and scientists speak in more and more specialized jargon and political correctness czars try to edit what remains of public expression.


Fed's No. 2 Is Said to Be Dissatisfied
Raising a delicate political question, Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, has been expressing dissatisfaction with his job to Administration officials, leading the White House to begin looking for a possible successor when his term ends in January, officials said today.
Mr.
Blinder has long been interested in becoming chairman of the Federal Reserve.
But the Administration has been strongly leaning toward reappointing Alan Greenspan -- who is popular among Republicans in the Senate whose approval is needed for the job.
Mr.
Greenspan's four-year term ends in March.

Trial of a Queens Doctor In Botched Abortion Starts
Fearing that he could lose his medical license, a Queens doctor intentionally misled paramedics who arrived at his office two years ago to treat a 33-year-old woman who bled to death after an abortion, prosecutors said yesterday as they began their murder case against the doctor.
Barry A. Schwartz, the chief assistant district attorney of Queens, said in his opening statement to the jury that Dr.
David Benjamin told paramedics that the woman, Guadalupe Negron, had suffered a heart attack when in fact she had bled to death while the doctor was in a separate room performing another abortion.

Alice V. Keliher, 92, Authority On Childhood Education, Dies
Alice V. Keliher, whose experiences as a lightly trained teacher of ill-prepared first graders led her to become a renowned expert on early childhood education and a champion of giving children unreserved respect and affection, died on Tuesday at the Tucson Medical Center in Arizona.
She was 92.
A longtime professor of education at New York University, Miss Keliher cherished her unofficial title as the "grandmother of day care."

Nearly Vandalproof Hydrants; Trying Again to Beat Those Trying to Beat Heat
It has long been one of the defining symbols of summer in New York City: the open fire hydrant, gushing needed relief from the fierce heat and humidity that seems to invade the five boroughs every July.
The city, which has long sought to plug the flood of millions of gallons of water down the drain, has tried unsuccessfully to close the hydrants with valves, harnesses and shields.
But now, with water an increasingly precious commodity, officials are hoping that a new locking device will make open hydrants a vanishing urban artifact, going the way of Ebbets Field and stickball.


Poverty Rate Is the Highest In 16 Years, A Report Says
Nearly 3 out of every 10 New Yorkers live in poverty, more than at any time during the last 16 years, according to a new analysis by an advocacy group using data from the Census Bureau.
The analysis, by the Community Service Society of New York, found that 1.9 million New York City residents -- more than 27 percent -- had incomes in 1993 that fell below Federal poverty standards.
The figure has fluctuated since the group began keeping statistics in 1979, but has risen steadily since the city's economic boom began tapering off during the late 1980's.


Earl Coleman, 69, Jazz-Ballad Singer
Earl Coleman, a jazz singer who recorded with Charlie Parker, Sonny Rollins and Shirley Scott among others, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan.
He was 69.
He suffered cardiac arrest, said Mike Abene, a pianist who often accompanied him.
He did not give further details.


Rabbi Won't Face Charge of Bribery
Bribery charges against an Orthodox rabbi in Lakewood, N.J., and two other men were dismissed yesterday in New Jersey Superior Court.


With consumers surfing around TV commercials at home, some companies take the ads on the road.
AS more consumers "zap" television commercials, advertisers have hit on another strategy to get their messages across: if consumers won't watch commercials at home, why not take the commercials on the road to presumably zap-proof venues?
That idea, part of a strategy known as "place based advertising," went through a rocky period a few years ago.
But now, media giants like Turner Broadcasting System, the Blockbuster Entertainment unit of Viacom Inc. and Capital Cities/ ABC, as well as upstarts like the College Television Network, are beaming programming and commercials into hundreds of new venues once thought unsuitable for television advertising.


Fox Plans 'Budgie' Cartoons in a Deal With Duchess of York
The Fox Broadcasting Company announced today that it had negotiated a deal for a new cartoon series for preschool children with a somewhat unlikely partner: the Duchess of York.
Beginning in the fall, Fox will broadcast episodes of an animated series based on "Budgie, the Little Helicopter," a character created by the Duchess in a series of children's books she started writing in 1989.


Decrying Base-Closing Plan as an 'Outrage,' the President Gives a Grudging Go-Ahead
President Clinton gave a grudging go-ahead today to closing or consolidating 105 military bases.
The shutdowns, a consequence of the end of the cold war, are expected to save billions of Federal dollars but put tens of thousands of people out of work.
Furiously pounding the lectern in a Rose Garden talk with reporters, the President called an independent commission's recommendations to close two large Air Force depots in California and Texas "an outrage" that ignored the economic pain it inflicted.
He said his political enemies had made "a calculated, deliberate attempt" to turn his efforts to preserve jobs at those bases "into a political thing, and to obscure the real economic impact."


Sports of The Times; Strawberry Attempts To Do It Over Again
UNDER the provisions of house, or, rather, hotel arrest, Darryl Strawberry, the newest Columbus Clipper, who arrived Wednesday from the Class A Tampa Yankees, must adhere to a strict routine, mandated by the Federal court and administered with the cooperation of another prodigious entity, George M. Steinbrenner.
One of the few things Strawberry is allowed by law to do outside of his hotel room is swing at a baseball.
And last night he got his first chance since his modified incarceration to do so on the Class AAA level, batting third as the designated hitter for the Clippers against Pawtucket at Cooper Stadium and lining a single to center off a former Mets teammate, Wally Whitehurst, in his first at-bat.
By game's end, a 9-3 Clippers victory, Strawberry had added a prodigious three-run homer off the right-field scoreboard against Mike Harley while going 2 for 4 amid a smattering of boos transformed into cheers.


Delicate Matters of Balance
The instruments, even the hall, must match if Baroque performance is to go well these days.
And indeed, Catherine Mackintosh, Maggie Cole and the Frick Collection's small, rounded space fit together as well as they possibly could.
Miss Mackintosh played the Baroque violin and briefly the viola d'amore on Wednesday.
Miss Cole was the harpsichordist.
The hall, overflowing with listeners, resonated at just about the right rate.
Other balances are less easy to manage.
How generous, for example, is a composer to one part relative to another?
How seductive are the personalities of the performers?
Here were Wednesday's mismatches.
In most of this program, especially in the three Bach duo sonatas, the harpsichord overwhelmed.
Charles Noblet's mordant C-major Sonata was originally advertised, we were told, as keyboard music with violin obbligato; much of the Bach could have shared the same description.


U.N. Chief Keeps Promise To Visit War-Torn Africa
For the last several days, as the news from Bosnia has grown more grim, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has kept his promise to visit three African countries tormented by civil wars that have killed more than a million people and scattered hundreds of thousands of refugees.
Insisting that he has "excellent communications" with New York, Geneva and Zagreb, Mr.
Boutros-Ghali seems intent on demonstrating that a crisis in Europe should not automatically take precedence over all others.


Slippery Going On the Trapeze
The hot weather made life high above the circus crowds even more treacherous than usual.
George Marinof, a trapeze artist, said he suffered his worst-ever case of sweaty hands during a Milwaukee circus performance on Thursday.
He and his wife, Louisa, slipped, but he was able to catch her in time.


Reflecting on Vietnam Ties, Many Agree That It's Time
A generation ago, when the Vietnam War was driving a wedge through America, Marco Scolari, a union concrete worker and World War II veteran, could scarcely bring himself to speak to any man who had avoided military service.
Back then, it seemed that passions over Vietnam might never cool, on either side.
But when President Clinton extended diplomatic recognition to Vietnam on Tuesday, a move that once would surely have ignited a firestorm, the response across the nation, in interviews with dozens of Americans, was measured, and mostly favorable.


Blues Add Courtnall to Shopping Cart
The St.
Louis Blues continued their July spending spree yesterday, signing the unrestricted free agent left wing GEOFF COURTNALL to a three-year, $6.6 million deal.
Earlier in the week, the Blues signed two other unrestricted free agents, goalie GRANT FUHR and right wing BRIAN NOONAN.
On draft day last Saturday, they signed Buffalo center DALE HAWERCHUK.


Reporting on U.N. Offers Skewed Picture
To the Editor:
Re "Sinister? U.N.'s Simply in the Dark" (Week in Review, July 9): Your statement that the United Nations' "most efficient employees are the short-order cooks in the cafeteria" is an inaccurate and uncalled-for insult to the hard-working staff of the United Nations. (In fact, these cooks are not United Nations employees; they work for a contractor.)


Vaughn Bruises Eye in Fight
Mo Vaughn, the major leagues' home run and r.b.i. leader, sustained a bruised left eye when he was assaulted at a nightclub early this morning, the Boston Red Sox said.
He missed his first game of the year tonight against Texas.
The incident occurred as Vaughn was defending a woman friend at the club after Thursday night's 9-8 loss to the Rangers, Red Sox Manager Kevin Kennedy said.


Graf Investigated Over German Taxes
Lawyers for the Wimbledon champion, STEFFI GRAF, said yesterday that investigators were ignorant of her tax situation, and the world's top-ranked woman player said she trusted her father's management of her financial affairs.
Graf, and her father, PETER GRAF, are suspected of tax evasion, German newspapers reported this week.
Authorities confirm that investigators searched the Graf family villa in Bruhl on May 23 and seized documents.


New Zealand Seeks Causes of Suicides by Young
From a distance, at least, a teen-ager raised in New Zealand would seem to be growing up in paradise.
The country is affluent and peaceful, blessed with a natural beauty that leaves poets grasping for comparisons to the glories both of the English countryside and of the rugged Scandinavian coastlines.
New Zealand should offer its young people the sort of life that most teen-agers elswhere can only dream of.


Rutgers Pays Top Dollar for New Coach
Rutgers University yesterday hired C. Vivian Stringer as its new women's basketball coach, paying her more than the men's basketball and football coaches and making her perhaps the highest-paid coach in her field.
Stringer, who compiled a 269-84 record at the University of Iowa the last 12 seasons, signed a multiyear contract that will pay her a base salary of $150,000 a year, which could grow considerably based on benefits and incentive clauses.

Decade-Old New York Newsday To Cease Publishing Tomorrow
New York Newsday, a suburban newspaper's bold experiment in breaking into the largest and most competitive city market with a new type of tabloid, will publish its last issue tomorrow, its publishers said yesterday.
The paper, which emerged in the economic boom of the mid-1980's, was the victim of corporate pressures for profits and of a newspaper market that changed sharply over the last decade, as the paper struggled to build a readership from a new middle class in the city, particularly Brooklyn and Queens.


RESULTS PLUS
GOLF  Colbert Sets Record
The sweltering heat didn't slow down Jim Colbert yesterday as he shot a nine-under-par 63, a tournament and course record, to take a four-stroke lead halfway through the Senior Players Championship in Dearborn, Mich.
Colbert, who won this senior major in 1993, chipped in for an eagle on the par-5 17th and was at 11-under 133 for 36 holes, with Lee Trevino and J. C. Snead tied for second on a day when temperatures topped 100.
Trevino shot a 67, while Snead had a 68 at the 6,876-yard TPC of Michigan.
The course's designer, Jack Nicklaus and Bob Murphy, the Senior PGA Tour money leader, were in a group tied at 139. (AP)
GALLAGHER TAKES LEAD: Jim Gallagher Jr., one of the rising stars on the PGA Tour, moved to the top of leader board yesterday after two rounds of the Anheuser-Busch Golf Classic in Williamsburg, Va.
Gallagher shot a six-under-par 65, matching the best score of the first two rounds, to reach the midpoint of the $1.1 million event at 8-under 134.
Blaine McCallister's 67 and Jim Carter's 69 left them one stroke off the lead. (AP)


Reporting on U.S. Officers Skewed Picture
To the Editor:
"Mismanagement and Waste Erode U.N.'s Best Intentions" (front page, June 23) incorrectly criticized the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and its chairman.
At meetings on June 30 and July 7 representatives of the European Union, Group of 77, Australia, Canada, China, Lesotho, Tunisia and Mexico expressed dismay at the article.
ADRIEN TEIRLINCK  Chairman, Fifth Committee General Assembly, United Nations New York, July 10, 1995


California Lottery And Equifax Settle
Equifax Inc. said today that it had settled a lawsuit with the California State Lottery, clearing the way for the company to resume work under a contract that could bring Equifax as much as $150 million over the life of the 66-month contract.
In April 1993 the lottery sued the Equifax subsidiary High Integrity Systems Inc. contending that the company had missed several deadlines for setting up lottery equipment and that the final delivered system was incomplete.


Heat Wave's Effects Will Linger on Farms
Livestock is no longer dropping dead in droves, but farmers in the Midwest expect to be suffering the effects of this week's heat wave for weeks to come.
"The real loss to the economy comes from the millions of animals that didn't put on weight, not the few thousand that died," said Lee M. Reeve, who operates a cattle feed lot in Garden City, Kan.


State Seeks Casino Offers With Hefty Guarantees
Taking an important step toward opening a casino in Bridgeport, Gov.
John G. Rowland issued a formal call today for proposals from developers that required guarantees to the state of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.
The request for proposals represents the latest round in a three-year-old campaign by civic and political leaders in Bridgeport to win state approval for a gambling and entertainment complex to revive their ailing city.
And again there is one central question: Will any prospective developer be able to guarantee that it can cover the money that the Mashantucket Pequot Indians would stop paying the state if they were stripped of their monopoly on casino gambling?


Godtfred K. Christiansen, 75; Covered the World With Lego
Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, a Danish executive who made Lego plastic building-block sets into children's favorites in many countries around the world, died on Thursday in his house in Billund, Denmark.
He was 75.
He had been in ill health for a number of years, said David M. Lafrennie, a spokesman for Lego Systems Inc. in Enfield, Conn., a unit of the Lego business empire, which is based in Billund.


13-Year-Old Pleads Not Guilty
A 13-year-old boy pleaded not guilty in Family Court yesterday to strangling a 3-year-old girl who would not stop crying.
Carmen Messano, the Hudson County Prosecutor, said it appeared that the girl, Chantel Cuffee, was sleeping in the boy's room Tuesday night, when the strangling occurred, because the teen-ager's older sister was her baby sitter.


Technology Issues Move Up As Some Other Sectors Slip
Technology stocks held up yesterday as many other widely followed issues posted losses.
The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology issues, ended higher, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index declined.
"The technology sector came back from early weakness," said Ricky Harrington, senior vice president of Interstate/Johnson Lane, a securities firm in Charlotte, N.C.
"And most of those issues have yet to report their earnings."


High Proportion of AIDS Cases
The number of pediatric AIDS cases in Newark has risen from 59 to 135 over the last six years, while during the same period, the proportion of black children with the disease has increased from 76.2 percent to 83.7 percent, the Black Leadership Commission on AIDS reported yesterday.
Blacks constitute 55 percent of Newark's population, yet make up 84 percent of the people with AIDS.


Juice Wars: The Squeeze Is On; Snapple Looks Back to See Coke and Pepsi Gaining
The cola wars were hot, but the juice wars are hotter.
Two of the biggest players in the exploding market for juices are the big rivals from the cola wars: Coke and Pepsi.
Though they miscalculated the depth of America's thirst for "new age" juice drinks pioneered by the Snapple Beverage Corporation, they are now catching up with Snapple and quirky innovators like Arizona.


Grant for Homeless Projects
About $26.7 million in Federal grants to move the homeless from city streets to decent housing and improve job training and mental health services were announced yesterday at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development's offices here.
The grants, earmarked for homeless projects of 13 organizations and municipalities, include $7.5 million to the city of Paterson, $6 million to the state's Department of Community Affairs offices in Jersey City, $3.7 million to the Y.M.C.A. of Passaic-Clifton and $3 million to the Douglass-Harrison Housing Corporation in Newark.


All Aboard for Cataclysm And Just Forget the Bar Car
With his hard-boiled squint, several Supermen's worth of slicked-back hair and a voice that rarely rises above a craggy whisper, Steven Seagal is an action-hero to gratify the wildest middle-aged male fantasies of indestructibility.
In "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory," the sequel to his runaway hit of three years ago, the actor's invincible alter ego, Casey Ryback, returns to do battle with Travis Dane, a monstrous computer nerd portrayed with a grinning, glassy-eyed relish by Eric Bogosian.
Most of the action takes place on the Grand Continental train, as it speeds from Denver to Los Angeles.
Early in the film, which opened yesterday, Dane and a band of mercenaries hijack the train and turn it into a computer command center.
From there they seize control of a United States satellite armed with a particle destroyer that Dane, a former Government scientist, invented before he was fired.


Talks on Beach Party Restraints
Facing criticism over the police shutdown of streets and diversion of cars last Sunday during the annual Greekfest beach party by thousands of black fraternity members, the Mayor and police officials are scheduling more meetings with civil rights organizations.
Mayor Kenneth E. Pringle said the police were motivated only by traffic and crowd control concerns when they turned away nonresidents, but some black organizations are calling it racial discrimination.
"There are two sets of interests here that are hard to reconcile. There is some resentment on both sides," the Mayor said yesterday.


The Little Operetta Trying to Be an Opera
By 1885, when Johann Strauss Jr., then 60, composed "Der Zigeunerbaron" ("The Gypsy Baron"), he was completely bored with his enormous popularity as the "Waltz King." For 15 years he had been turning out operettas.
And though he had one solid hit, "Die Fledermaus," most of his stage works had short-lived success.
He usually wound up lifting the waltz tunes and recycling them for use by the family dance band.
But "The Gypsy Baron" was Strauss's attempt to write a work with more musical depth.
Though still indisputably an operetta, with its spoken dialogue, frothy waltzes and a comic story of a dispossessed Hungarian landowner's son who hopes to reclaim his land from a band of Gypsies, Strauss pushed this operetta in the direction of opera.


Journal; Such Stuff as Dreams
The moon hanging right over the stage wasn't quite full.
Not everything can be perfect.
But for a vision of ecstasy in New York City, it would be hard to top the scene in Central Park last Sunday night as 1,900 people watched "The Tempest."
The tickets were free.
The performance transformed an urban patch of green into an island paradise, carpeted in sand and bewitched by apparitions.
And there was Patrick Stewart as Prospero: as the old magician finally gave up his powers at evening's end, the actor pointedly spoke the final verses of Shakespeare's valedictory play without a microphone.
Mr.
Stewart's metallic baritone, nurtured at England's Royal Shakespeare Company and known to Americans from "Star Trek: The Next Generation," carried effortlessly -- even though the house is as large as any Broadway barn, with an acoustically worthless canopy of stars for a roof.


U.S. Weighs a Response To French Call on Bosnia
President Clinton's senior national security advisers huddled for more than two hours today but failed to produce a response to the French challenge to the United States and Britain to increase their involvement in the faltering United Nations peacekeeping effort in Bosnia.
Instead, despite a growing Bosnian Serb offensive, Mr.
Clinton ordered Gen.
John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to attend a meeting of defense ministers in London on Sunday to listen to the French explain their proposal in more detail and to search for an allied policy.


Frustrated Croats Are Openly Preparing a Major Assault on a Serbian Enclave
As the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Bosnia reels from fresh attacks by rebel Serbs, the Government of Croatia is planning to open a major new front in the Balkan war.
Increasingly frustrated at the failure of diplomacy to recover the large chunk of their country that has been occupied by Serbian rebels since 1991, Croatian leaders are urgently preparing a major attack on the Serbian enclave.


County Clerk Convicted in Graft
Michael S. Keating, the Camden County Clerk, was convicted yesterday of taking $173,000 in bribes over 15 years from two printers of election ballots.
Mr.
Keating, 55, faces a minimum of seven years in prison when he is sentenced in September.

Heat and Rare Wetness Add Up to Misery
Heat waves come and go at this time of year, but the one now engulfing the Northeast after tormenting the country's midsection all week stands out in one respect: Seldom are temperatures this high accompanied by such high humidity.
"It's just an unbelievably juicy air mass," said Colin Marquis, a meteorologist at the Pennsylvania State University Weather Communications Group.
"The humidity is as high as we've ever seen in a very warm summer air mass this far north of the Gulf of Mexico for many, many years."


Observer; You in There, Bob?
Bob Dole was on television the other night doing his darnedest not to look like Bob Dole.
You could see, though, that it wasn't easy.
Under attack, he is afflicted with an instinct for the crushing rebuttal.
This night he was having a hard time keeping his thermostat low.
Having been anointed "front-runner" for the Republican nomination, Dole is everybody's target for destruction.
The media will need to get rid of him by next winter in order to spin their entertaining horse-race tale of upsets, crippled front-runners, new faces, all the usual hocus-pocus.


Intuit Signs 19 Deals for Home-Banking Software
Intuit Inc. announced yesterday that 19 financial institutions, including many of the nation's largest banks, credit card companies and brokerage firms, would use its popular Quicken software for home banking services beginning this fall.
The move signals the company's intent to compete aggressively with the Microsoft Corporation after the collapse in May of plans for the two companies to merge.


CHRONICLE
Earth is starting to feel a lot more normal for Dr.
NORMAN E. THAGARD, the American astronaut who returned a week ago from Russia's Mir space station after spending 115 days in orbit, a United States record.
He is still a little weak and has to stop to catch his breath occasionally, but he has regained some of the 30 pounds he lost in space, The Associated Press reported yesterday.


Mexican Bailout Defended Amid G.O.P. Criticism
Top Treasury officials today defended the American-led bailout of Mexico last winter as a success, but Congressional Republicans criticized the Administration for lending more money to Mexico this summer.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, told the Senate Banking Committee that the Treasury's $20 billion line of credit was essential in preventing a financial crisis in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America that would have threatened economic growth and national security in the United States.


Outside Counsel May Yet Look at Gingrich
The House ethics committee may yet seek an outside counsel to help it look into complaints against Speaker Newt Gingrich, the committee's chairwoman says.
In an interview on Thursday, the chairwoman, Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, also said the committee's decision not to hold a formal preliminary inquiry on Mr.
Gingrich by creating a subcommittee of investigation, a step its rules apparently require, had been made out of concern for efficiency and consensus.


Rail Talks Incite Debate On Strike Law
Negotiations between the Metro-North Railroad and 17 of its unions intensified yesterday, but officials on both sides of the dispute said they were far from a contract settlement.
The unions are threatening to strike as early as 12:01 tomorrow morning.
As negotiations continued, a political skirmish broke out between Gov.
George E. Pataki, who has used the threat of a Metro-North strike to call for a change in Federal labor law, and Representative Nita M. Lowey of Westchester County, who accused the Governor of holding Metro-North commuters hostage to a Congressional debate.


Bridge
One of the most entertaining bridge books published in recent years is "The Kings' Tales," by Phillip and Robert King.
It is available for $19.50 including mailing from The Bridge World, 39 West 94th Street, New York 10025.
Each of the 30 tales is a plausible parody of a well-known writer.
Some are bridge specialists, like Matthew Granovetter, Mike Lawrence, Victor Mollo, Skid Simon and Terence Reese.
More widely known victims are Ambrose Bierce, Raymond Chandler, Noel Coward, Arthur Conan Doyle, Kenneth Grahame, Ernest Hemingway, Henry James, Damon Runyon and P. G. Wodehouse.


For Refugees, Grief; For Diplomats, Talk
Propelled by the continuing Serb drive across eastern Bosnia, thousands of terrorized Muslims overwhelmed ill-prepared aid workers in Tuzla.
They camped in open fields, begging food and water and wailing over the fates of men taken away by Bosnian Serb forces.

Torrid Heat, Intensifying, Grips Region
The scourge of heat that killed at least 15 people and thousands of cattle in the Midwest descended upon the New York area yesterday, bringing a high-misery combination of near-record temperatures in the mid-90's and the heavy wetness of a tropical rain forest.
The regionwide steam bath was expected to intensify today.
Because warmer air has a greater capacity for moisture, today's high humidity levels will represent the highest moisture content detected at these latitudes in recent years, meteorologists said.
Conditions will begin to ease on Sunday.


More French Fireworks For Jalabert's Victory
Laurent Jalabert lived the dream of every French bicycle racer in the Tour de France today, winning the daily stage on Bastille Day as the national holiday was celebrated with parades, dances, fireworks and enormous crowds at the sides of the road.
Here in Mende, deep in the heartland and no doubt across the country, people cheered and hugged each other in the joy of being French and seeing a Frenchman win on Bastille Day for the first time in six years.


Vaughn Bruises Eye in Fight
Mo Vaughn, the major leagues' home run and r.b.i. leader, sustained a bruised left eye when he was assaulted at a nightclub early this morning, the Boston Red Sox said.
He missed his first game of the year tonight against Texas.
The incident occurred as Vaughn was defending a woman friend at the club after Thursday night's 9-8 loss to the Rangers, Red Sox Manager Kevin Kennedy said.


Royals Put Wandering Lind on Waivers
The Kansas City Royals yesterday asked waivers on their wandering second baseman, JOSE LIND.
Lind, the 1992 Gold Glove winner for the Pittsburgh Pirates, hasn't played since June 2 when he left the Royals without notifying team officials.
He said wants to play again, preferably in Kansas City, but Manager BOB BOONE and other team officials have consistently said they don't want him back.
"I like it here a lot," Lind said from his suburban Kansas City, Mo., home.
"But it didn't work out. Hopefully, somebody will take me."


Mitchell Reported Returning to Japan
KEVIN MITCHELL will return to Japan next week after a controversial two-month hiatus, according to a news report in Tokyo.
Mitchell, a former National League most valuable player and the highest-paid player ever in Japan at about $4 million a year, left the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks for the United States in May for treatment of a knee injury.
Hawks officials had disputed the seriousness of the injury. (AP)


Violence Grows Against Ranchers
To the Editor:
Jeff DeBonis, in his July 7 Op-Ed article, suggests that recent violence against Federal office buildings in the West is the work of local officials and Western commodity producers.

After Years Of Fighting Big Losses, A Retreat
When New York Newsday's final issue rolls off the press tomorrow, it will have lasted 10 years, 3 months and 1 day.
Begun with expectations that it would outlive at least one of its competitors, it will be survived by the same three newspapers that it squared off against on Day 1: The Daily News, The New York Post and The New York Times.
For most of its life, New York Newsday was the scrappy fourth newspaper in a city that many analysts said could support only two: The Times and one of the tabloids.


Can Alternative Medicine Heal? Trials Will Tell
To the Editor:
Robert L. Park, in "The Danger of Voodoo Science" (Op-Ed, July 9), may be right that Western scientific methods are underappreciated.
But he weakens his argument with invidious critiques of alternative viewpoints and practices, calling them "nincompoopery" and "foolishness."


After Blunt Notice, Newsroom Is in Shock at a Wake for Itself
"I don't know what to say," said Murray Kempton, surely for the only time in his decades of newspapering.
"I'm at a loss for words."
The Pulitzer prize-winning columnist, whose baroque sentences have adorned a succession of the city's newspapers, dazzling and delighting, looked sadly around the newsroom of New York Newsday, where stunned reporters, editors and photographers were trying to console one another over the brief, blunt announcement that the owners were folding the scrappy paper.


Retired Police Chief Is Killed in a Cemetery Holdup
A retired police chief from Hanover, N.J., was shot to death yesterday in a Newark cemetery while trying to help an elderly friend who had been set upon by robbers, the police said..
The victim, John Deventer, 65, who retired only last fall from the department he had headed for 14 years, had driven two friends to Fairmount Cemetery on Central Avenue, where the shooting occurred about 11:15 A.M.


President Is Said to Endorse Most of Affirmative Action
President Clinton briefed leaders of civil rights groups today on his five-month review of affirmative action programs, and people who attended the meeting predicted that Mr.
Clinton would vigorously defend most such programs in a speech next week.
But Administration officials said Mr.
Clinton might suggest changes in some purchasing programs that reserve Federal contracts for companies owned by blacks or women.
Under a proposal being considered by the President, they said, eligibility for such programs could be expanded to include businesses that locate in poor areas, even if the companies were owned by whites.


County Clerk Convicted in Graft
Michael S. Keating, the Camden County Clerk, was convicted yesterday of taking $173,000 in bribes over 15 years from two printers of election ballots.

Echoes of the Big Bang; The Bomb Imposed Its Own Peace
Just before dawn on July 16, 1945 50 years ago tomorrow -- the first atomic bomb exploded on a tower in the high desert north of Alamogordo, N.M., at a place code-named Trinity.
"A new thing had just been born," said the physicist I. I. Rabi, who was there, "a new control." Released nuclear energy, Dr.
Rabi thought, was a new power "which man had acquired over nature," but he also believed that it would result in a "new understanding of man."
In the long run, the new power demonstrated at Trinity changed the conditions that had made it possible to shed the blood of nations in world wars.


A Quiet Evening River Cruise Became a Terrifying Adventure
The printed invitations promised a relaxing river cruise, a quiet night on the water under the city's shimmering lights.
And it began just that way.
At about 6:30 P.M.
Thursday, 33 guests from the midtown law firm of Fish &amp; Neave climbed aboard the Other Office, a 46 1/2-foot cabin cruiser, at the North Cove Marina in Battery Park City in lower Manhattan.
On the boat, a caterer had laid out a six-foot hero sandwich, potato salad, cole slaw and drinks.
There was a magician on board and a portrait artist.


Talks on Beach Party Restraints
Facing criticism over the police shutdown of streets and diversion of cars last Sunday during the annual Greekfest beach party by thousands of black fraternity members, the Mayor and police officials are scheduling more meetings with civil rights organizations.
Mayor Kenneth E. Pringle said the police were motivated only by traffic and crowd control concerns when they turned away nonresidents, but some black organizations are calling it racial discrimination.
"There are two sets of interests here that are hard to reconcile. There is some resentment on both sides," the Mayor said yesterday.


Indian Music and Dance
A program of Indian music and dance is to be presented by Ananda Shankar and his company tomorrow at 5 P.M. at Colden Center, Queens College, Kissena Boulevard and the Long Island Expressway, Flushing.
Mr.
Shankar is the son of Uday and Amala Shankar, the dancers, and the nephew of Ravi Shankar, the sitarist.
The program, which features the dance-drama "Mrignayani," is being produced by the Bengali Association of North America and the Nav Nirmaan Foundation, which helps South Asians living in the United States.


School Plan Faulted  Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that the Board of Education had to work harder to cut its bureaucracy and look for volunteer help before increasing class size or shortening school days. The Mayor lashed out at a plan from Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines that local districts be given authority to reduce the school week to 26 hours from 27 1/2 and to increase the size of some classes to 27 from 25.     Article, page 25.


Grant for Homeless Projects
About $26.7 million in Federal grants to move the homeless from city streets to decent housing and improve job training and mental health services were announced yesterday at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development's offices here.
The grants, earmarked for homeless projects of 13 organizations and municipalities, include $7.5 million to the city of Paterson, $6 million to the state's Department of Community Affairs offices in Jersey City, $3.7 million to the Y.M.C.A. of Passaic-Clifton and $3 million to the Douglass-Harrison Housing Corporation in Newark.


Ringo Starr's Fans Look Back and Sing
As the popular rock music of decades past turns into nostalgia, its vision, passion and ability to inspire change often wear away.
What's left are just songs, stripped of meaning but full of familiarity.
On Thursday night at Radio City Music Hall, the former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr gathered a mixed bag of rockers from the 1960's and 70's to perform together as Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band.
The concert was fun, with each member of the band belting out one of his former hits in round-robin style.
Mr.
Starr turned "Yellow Submarine" into a sing-along; the guitarist Randy Bachman of Bachman-Turner Overdrive turned "Takin' Care of Business" into a sing-along, and the former Grand Funk Railroad guitarist Mark Farner turned "The Loco-Motion" into a sing-along.


Data Suggest Turnaround For Economy
Fresh Government figures today lent strong support to the notion that the slow economy of recent months is heading for better times, not a recession.
Fears of recession ebbed as the Commerce Department reported that consumers spent less warily this spring than had been thought.
Retail sales were up an estimated seven-tenths of 1 percent in June on top of a gain of nine-tenths of 1 percent in May, which was originally reported as a rise of just two-tenths.


2 Indicted in Counselor's Death
It has been almost six months since Robert Heavey died after he was injured during a disturbance at the Morris County Youth Center, where he was a part-time counselor.
Mr.
Heavey was punched above the eye during a Jan. 3 melee.
He later slipped into a coma.
Two youths who were being held in the center on robbery charges at the time of the melee were indicted yesterday in Mr.
Heavey's death.
Kevin Harrington and Delfon Robins face life sentences.


Parolee Is Arrested for a Rape In Upper East Side Apartment
A 24-year-old Manhattan man paroled less than a month ago from a Federal penitentiary was arrested yesterday at his mother's apartment on the Lower East Side and accused of raping a young woman Wednesday night in her penthouse apartment off Fifth Avenue.
The suspect was identified by the police as Raymond Clyde of 286 South Street, who was released on June 30 from a prison in Lewisburg, Pa., where he was serving concurrent four-and-a-half-year Federal and state sentences for robbery and the sale of heroin.


Newspapers to Merge
The Home News of East Brunswick will merge with the News Tribune of Woodbridge to form one newspaper serving the central New Jersey market, parent companies of the two papers announced yesterday.
New Jersey Press Inc., which also owns The Asbury Park Press, acquired the News Tribune from the Bergen Record Corporation, owner of The Record in Hackensack.


Buchanan Challenges Gramm to Debate
Raw Presidential politics intruded on the Republican Party's hopes for a harmonious summer meeting here today as Patrick J. Buchanan challenged Senator Phil Gramm of Texas to a televised debate over who is the true conservative seeking the party's nomination.
That prompted a third contender, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, to jump into the crossfire, presenting himself as the voice of civility and warning that such rivalries are no way to attract voters.

Editors' Note
An article on July 10, in the "Fine Print" series about legislation, described the drafting of a law on taxing Americans who become citizens of other countries.
The proposed law allows an American who takes the citizenship of a spouse's or parent's native country to apply for an exemption to the expatriates' tax.


Don't 'Throw Until You Die'
Two decades after Commodore Matthew Perry forced Japan out of isolation in 1854, the Japanese started playing baseball.
This year Hideo Nomo, the 26-year-old imported pitching star of the Los Angeles Dodgers, has emerged to remind Americans that Japan's longstanding baseball pretensions must be taken seriously.
By instantly becoming one of the best pitchers in the National League, Nomo has enlivened and internationalized the game in a sullen year.
The secret of his success may be instructive.
When he was pitching for the Kintetsu Buffaloes, a team based in Osaka and owned by a railroad company, Nomo led his league in strikeouts and victories.
But his team was rarely on television and he played in relative obscurity.
The only real fame he gained stemmed from his decision to quit and join the Dodgers.
Denounced then as an ingrate and a traitor, Nomo is today a bigger hero in Japan than he would have been had he remained.
Some are claiming that his performance shows the superiority of Japanese baseball techniques.

SERB FORCES SHELL U.N. PEACEKEEPERS AT 2d 'SAFE' AREA
Ignoring international condemnation and Western threats of retaliation, Bosnian Serb forces began an attack on another Muslim enclave in eastern Bosnia today, hours after they completed the "ethnic cleansing" of a nearby Muslim area overrun on Wednesday.
The new attack's target was the town of Zepa, which has an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 Muslim residents and 79 Ukrainian peacekeepers who were deployed to protect its status as a "safe area."


Chaos Looms as Rwandans Refuse to Go Home
A year after an exodus of a million Rwandans flooded the plains around Goma, more than 720,000 Hutu refugees remain in camps in the area, many of them afraid to return, others rearming and preparing for a military offensive against the Tutsi-led Government in Rwanda.
The refugees here are Hutu who fled the advancing Tutsi rebel army that took control of Rwanda last year.
They include tens of thousands of soldiers, militiamen, civil servants and farmers who took part in the killing of at least 500,000 Tutsi and a small number of moderate Hutu politicians.


Sweat Equity
Whine, whine, whine.
Why do New Yorkers complain so much about the heat?
As dwellers in the temperate zone, they must -- all but the most recent arrivals -- be accustomed by now to the fact that some days in winter will be excruciatingly cold and some days in summer will be stifling.
And while we cannot claim scientific certainty for this, we are under the firm impression that the heat causes more consternation than the cold.
Why is this?
We cannot say for sure, but we can offer a hypothesis.
Men are at a greater disadvantage in the heat, due to their dress requirements, and men are bigger whiners.
For most of the year they are spoiled, comfortwise.
They do not have to deal with silly shoes that make them walk funny, trousers without pockets, hair spray or pantyhose.
Their business uniform normally makes sense.


New Spokeswoman for Whitman
Shaking up her communications staff 18 months into her administration, Governor Whitman named a new press secretary: Becky Taylor, until yesterday the public affairs director for Attonrey General Deborah T. Poritz.
Rita Manno, a former reporter who joined the Whitman staff at the start of the Governor's term in 1994, was asked to step aside and has not yet decided whether to accept other posts offered to her, aides said.
Ms.
Taylor's new job pays $84,500, the same as her old one.


Louise Reinhardt Smith, 91, Patron of the Modern, Is Dead
Louise Reinhardt Smith, a discerning collector of modern art and a prized supporter of the Museum of Modern Art since 1957, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan.
She was 91.
Ms.
Smith was one of the last of the strong-willed and independent-minded collectors whose activity was indispensable to the Museum of Modern Art at a time when there was still much new ground to be broken for its core collections.


Giants Sign Running Back
The Giants have signed another draft pick, running back Charles Way, according to his agent, Sean Holley.
Though the Giants have not officially announced the signing, the addition of Way, a sixth-round pick, means the team has signed two of its nine picks and should have most if not all of them signed by the end of next week -- just in time for the beginning of training camp on July 23.


Federal Chill Is Felt By Those in the Arts
For some time now, arts groups around the country have been bracing for big cuts in Federal spending on the arts.
But few were prepared for Thursday's move by Republicans in the House of Representatives to shut down the national arts and humanities endowments altogether within the next two years.
While the outcome of the House's actions remains unclear -- the proposals must first pass the entire House and then the Senate -- the mere fact that the abolition of the endowments had come to a vote jolted many arts groups into grappling with the unthinkable: life without Federal money.


Corrections

Ali Lawaji could not have looked more late 20th century as he drove along the desert sands, dropping a hand from the wheel to answer his cellular phone and talk about how his children need a computer to help them in their studies.
But Mr.

He is a goatherd -- "a profession," he says, "that you can't walk away from."


Guilty Plea in Tape Copying
A man who mass-produced bootlegged videotapes of hit movies like "Jurassic Park," "The Lion King" and "The Flintstones" in the basement of a home in Nutley pleaded guilty in Federal District Court yesterday to felony copy infringement.
The authorities said Nedal Yousef Rasheed made more than 1,000 illegal videotapes a day and earned more than $5,000 a month selling them on the streets of Newark and New York.
He agreed to turn in the tapes along with the 52 videocassette recorders he used to make the illegal copies.

Shore Revelers Under 21, Beware
Quaffing a cold one to beat the heat at the seashore is not a good idea if you are under 21, Attorney General Poritz warned yesterday in a visit to the Boardwalk.
She said the State Police and agents from the Alcoholic Beverage Control and her office are cracking down on under-age drinking during the summer, with a special emphasis on Shore areas.


Musician's Avant-Garde Soul
Last year Warner Brothers Records did something surprising: they recorded and released "Ancient Ritual," by Sonny Simmons, a West Coast avant-garde alto saxophonist.
Mr.
Simmons was somewhat obscure even at the height of his fame in the 1960's, and the album seemed an odd choice given the prevailing emphasis on classicism in the jazz.
Until one heard the album.
Mr.
Simmons, who has not performed in New York since 1968, is a blues musician, and his playing on the album exemplifies the best sort of avant-garde soul.
He is performing through tomorrow night at Iridium, and at his first set on Tuesday night it was clear that he was a formidable player, a product of a blues culture that no longer really exists.


Can Alternative Medicine Heal? Trials Will Tell; Endangered Habitats
To the Editor:
When Congress enacted the Endangered Species Act in 1973, it established a national commitment to preserve the nation's rarest biological resources.
With reauthorization of the act expected soon, the life science community is increasingly concerned that short-term gains to individuals will overshadow long-term benefits for society.


For Elderly and the Outcast, There's No Place Like This Home
RITA ROSS is sitting pretty.
In fact, the 74-year-old woman, who has spent her whole life within three blocks of her West 35th Street apartment, thinks everything has improved greatly since the mental patients and the homeless people moved into the tenement she had clung to since she became a bride during World War II.
"This isn't Hell's Kitchen anymore, it's God's little acre," she said as her parakeets sang from their cages and her three pugs skittered at her feet.


Hitchcock Is a Work In Progress For Yanks
The Yankees ostensibly brought in a new pitching coach, Nardi Contreras, to work with their young starters.
Coach Contreras, meet Sterling Hitchcock.
Hitchcock (3-6) lasted two batters into the fifth inning last night at Yankee Stadium, squandering a couple of early leads in the process.
Relievers Scott Bankhead and Dave Pavlas did not fare much better.
And after opening the second half of the season with a pair of impressive victories, the Yankees reverted to their form before the All-Star break, losing, 11-4, to the Minnesota Twins.


State to Retain Bond Rating
A leading bond-rating agency flashed approval of Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman's recently passed $16 billion budget yesterday.
Standard &amp; Poor's said that New Jersey will retain its double-A plus bond rating, the second-highest grade it gives, The Associated Press reported.
The agency said it believed the budget, bolstered by the $500 million state surplus, can withstand potential cuts in Federal aid, the posibility that Governor Whitman's revenue projections are too high and a dip in revenue from he income tax cut.
Bond ratings help determine interest rates on state borrowing.


Old Football Injuries and Arthritis Hobbled Simpson, Doctor Testifies
A doctor who examined O. J. Simpson twice in the days after Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman were killed testified today that although Mr.
Simpson had the "physique of Tarzan," a "whole array of the typical post-N.F.L. injury syndromes" and two kinds of arthritis left him slow of foot, even hobbling.
Dr.
Robert Huizenga testified that Mr.
Simpson, ravaged by disease and battered by being "banged against the turf" as a football player for too many years, was unable to walk properly and barely able to jog, let alone run as a fleeing murderer with a plane to catch might have had to do.
Dr.
Huizenga described Mr.
Simpson, 48, as a man whose damaged right ankle made him limp, whose left knee needed to be replaced and who could neither move forward nor laterally with ease.


Tactics Used Against Squatters Anger Neighbors and Stores
Art Guerra, a painter, supports his art with the business he runs on the Lower East Side, Guerra Paint, a supply store frequented by other artists and interior decorators.
But for the last several weeks, business has been seriously down, he said -- and not because of a market slowdown, rising costs or any of the other ordinary economic hazards.
It is Mr.
Guerra's misfortune to have his store at 510 East 13th Street, between Avenue A and Avenue B, a block that has been cordoned off by the police since late May, when, in quasi-military fashion, the city evicted squatters living in two tenement buildings.
Since then, officers have been stopping drivers and sometimes pedestrians, asking them their business on the block and encouraging mere passers-by to go elsewhere.


Blacks See Opening in A.F.L.-C.I.O. Leadership Fight
Black labor leaders, who have protested for years that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has ignored their concerns, now see in the struggle for the presidency of the union federation a rare opportunity to demand a much greater voice for blacks in the nation's labor movement.
The black leaders have drawn up 11 demands, most calling for more blacks in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s hierarchy and the hierarchies of its individual unions.
The two candidates vying for president of the federation have promised to bring more "diversity" to the labor movement.
But so far neither has explained in any detail how he would do this.

Prosecutor of Susan Smith Offers a Small Compromise
As the jury selection process dragged on today, the prosecutor in the Susan Smith murder trial said he would be willing to let the presiding judge determine her fate if she pleaded guilty to drowning her two sons.
But that deal would offer Mrs.

Billion-Dollar Bet on New Casino
Casino industry giants Mirage Resorts and Circus Circus laid down a billion dollars yesterday on a new 4,000-room casino hotel complex.
The project, on a 178-acre site in the marina district, will consist of twin 31-story hotel towers and a 115,000-square-foot-casino, said the chairman of Mirage, Steve Wynn, who sold the Golden Nugget casino here in 1987 and vowed never to return because of what he considered overzealous regulation.
Mr.
Wynn said restrictions lured him back, The Associated Press reported.
Ground breaking for the project - which is to generate 14,000 jobs - could come early next year.


Rosi Is Hit With a Two-Year Suspension
The World Boxing Organization superwelterweight champion, GIANFRANCO ROSI of Italy, was banned yesterday for two years for doping, but pledged to battle to overturn the ruling.
"I'll accept this verdict in the same way I have accepted my defeats in the ring," said Rosi.
"But my battle goes on. My lawyers will continue to act because justice must triumph." The Italian Boxing Federation imposed the mandatory two-year ban after Rosi, 37, tested positive for banned amphetamines after a title victory over Verno Phillips of the United States, in May.
An Italian federation judge, MARIO MENDICINI, accepted Rosi's defense that he and his doctors did not realize that a medicine he was taking for injuries contained the substances. (Reuters)

B-2, After 14 Years, Is Still Failing Basic Tests
The $44 billion B-2 bomber has radar that cannot distinguish a raincloud from a mountainside, has not passed most of its basic tests and may not be nearly as stealthy as advertised, according to a draft report by the General Accounting Office, the independent auditing agency of Congress.
The draft report began circulating today in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill as Congress considered proposals for additional financing to build new B-2's.
It was provided to The New York Times by a Government official skeptical of the bomber's capabilities who sought to bring into the debate the report's examples of the B-2's inability to pass performance hurdles.

Terrorized Human Tide Overwhelms Relief Camp
Terrorized Muslims by the tens of thousands overwhelmed aid workers in an ill-prepared emergency camp here today, part of a swelling human tide propelled by the continuing Bosnian Serb drive across eastern Bosnia.

Mayor Balks On Increase In Class Size
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that the Board of Education had to work harder at cutting its bureaucracy and should look for volunteer help before permitting a rise in class sizes or shortening the school day.
In his weekly radio program, the Mayor lashed out at suggestions made by Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines on Thursday that the 32 local school districts be given the authority to reduce the school week to 26 hours from 27 1/2 and to increase the size of first-, second- and third-grade classes to 27 from 25.

But Mr.
Jones said that he might argue that to do so would be self-incriminating.

Standard &amp; Poor's said that New Jersey will retain its double-A plus bond rating, the second-highest grade it gives, The Associated Press reported.
The agency said it believed the budget, bolstered by the $500 million state surplus, can withstand potential cuts in Federal aid, the posibility that Governor Whitman's revenue projections are too high and a dip in revenue from he income tax cut.
Bond ratings help determine interest rates on state borrowing.


Dance Team: 1 Spunky, 1 Stubborn, Both Artists
Marge and Gower Champion epitomized the all-American dance team in their Hollywood musicals and television appearances in the 1950's.
Their courtships on film showed them as healthy and unneurotic, often as a stage couple.
Total pros and good sports, they could hold their own when Jack Benny popped up in tights to learn ballet from them in a hilarious television skit.
The choreography and dancing of the Champions as individuals and as a husband and wife partnership (Mr. Champion died in 1980) were, however, more complex than this well-scrubbed image would have it.
Their wider ambitions and versatility were captured on Thursday when Marge Champion wittily discussed the couple's careers in the latest program of the series Capturing Choreography: Masters of Dance and Film.

New Spokeswoman for Whitman
Shaking up her communications staff 18 months into her administration, Governor Whitman named a new press secretary: Becky Taylor, until yesterday the public affairs director for Attonrey General Deborah T. Poritz.
Rita Manno, a former reporter who joined the Whitman staff at the start of the Governor's term in 1994, was asked to step aside and has not yet decided whether to accept other posts offered to her, aides said.
Ms.
Taylor's new job pays $84,500, the same as her old one.


Maggie Keswick, 53, Expert on Chinese Gardens
Maggie Keswick, a Scots-born connoisseur of China and its sensuous, mysterious gardens, died on July 8 in London.
She was 53 and had homes in London, Santa Monica, Calif., and Wellfleet, Mass.
The cause was breast cancer, said John Taylor Williams of Palmer &amp; Dodge, the family's legal counsel in Boston.


Speculation Rises About the State of Yeltsin's Health
Aides to President Boris N. Yeltsin, who was hospitalized on Tuesday with acute chest pain, said today that he had canceled a trip to Norway and all engagements until Monday, July 24, prompting renewed speculation about the state of his health.
It was a sharp change from the announcements of the last few days, which said that Mr.
Yeltsin's health was improving, and that he was in charge, at work and keeping control of the nuclear button.
Depending on the specific diagnosis and the serious of his condition, the doctors may be urging him to rest, and they may be acting cautiously.


Subway Saviors
New York City's Transit Authority did a remarkable job cleaning up the mess caused by a huge water main break near Times Square last Sunday.
A crew of close to 1,000 transit workers had the trains running on the West Side IRT line by the beginning of Monday morning's rush hour -- barely 24 hours after the tracks were completely submerged in water and electric circuits were covered in muck.
In a city whose citizens are often frustrated by the minor annoyances of everyday urban life, this was a welcome reminder that New York is capable of doing the big things well.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani applauded the efforts of everyone involved, singling out the leadership of Joseph Hoffman, the agency's vice president in charge of subways.
The plaudits were well deserved.


Mr. Arafat's Governance
Yasir Arafat as tough-minded political boss cracking down on Palestinian terrorists seems an incongruous image, but that roughly describes the latest step in his shift from Israel's enemy to its partner in peace.
The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization is now embarked on the administration of Gaza and Jericho, and he has made progress in establishing civil authority.
Mr.
Arafat's techniques leave much to be desired.
The hard-fisted repression and the lawless traditions of his guerrilla movement have led to serious human rights abuses.
Amnesty International and others have complained about secret detention and trials, abuse of suspects and unfair procedures.
Mr.
Arafat has certainly lost much of his romantic appeal to disaffected Palestinian youth.


Corrections
An article on Sunday about Republican efforts to reduce Federal spending omitted part of the House Appropriations Committee's budget proposal for the National Endowment for the Arts.
When an allotment for matching grants is included, the proposed budget is $99.5 million, or $62.9 million less than was allotted in 1995; the proposed budget is not $82.2 million.


Free Programs And Favorite Agencies Fall In Budget Cuts
"Woooh, woooh, we do not want to know about it," scolded a derisive Democrat in ghostly tones as the House Republican majority leadership found itself uncomfortably arguing, amid a long day of bare-knuckled budget cutting, against the cost-free use of volunteer bird-watchers in a nature census.
"Something in the sky," the Democrat, Harold L. Volkmer of Missouri, continued his needle, pointing upward in mock alarm as the Republicans glared in discomfort.
"No, it is not Superman. It might be a bird. We do not know, we do not want to know. Weird. Weird."


AIDS Test Involving Baboon Is Approved
An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration unanimously recommended today that one AIDS patient be allowed to receive an experimental bone marrow transplant from a baboon.
Baboons are naturally resistant to H.I.V.-1, the virus that is causing the overwhelming majority of AIDS cases in the world.
The goal of the experiment is to determine whether uninfected baboon cells will join the H.I.V.-infected human marrow to restore the body's immune function.


DIRECTOR OF F.B.I. DEMOTES DEPUTY
F.B.I.
Director Louis J. Freeh today demoted the bureau's Deputy Director, Larry A. Potts, citing the turmoil created by an internal investigation into the destruction of documents relating to the conduct of Mr.
Potts and other senior F.B.I. officials in a deadly 1992 standoff with a white separatist in Idaho.
Mr.
Freeh had promoted Mr.
Potts to the bureau's No. 2 job in May.
As deputy, Mr.
Potts was the F.B.I.'s chief operating officer, wielding authority over hundreds of criminal investigations, and had been in command of the investigation of the bombing last April of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.


METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK NEWSDAY TO STOP PUBLISHING New York Newsday, a bold experiment by a suburban newspaper to break into the largest and most competitive city market with a new type of tabloid, will publish its last issue tomorrow, its publishers said.
The paper, which emerged in the economic boom of the mid-1980's, was the victim of corporate pressures for profits and a market that changed sharply over the last decade.  [ Page 1. ] When its final issue rolls off the press, New York Newsday will have lasted 10 years, 3 months and 1 day.
Begun with expectations that it would outlive at least one of its competitors, it will be survived by the same three newspapers that it squared off against on Day 1: The Daily News, The New York Post and The New York Times.  [ 26. ]


Gingrich on Drug Dealers
Speaker Newt Gingrich today proposed a referendum on "very Draconian, very real steps" to punish international drug traffickers.
In brief remarks that were part of a speech to the Republican National Committee meeting here, Mr.
Gingrich asserted that anyone who is responsible for shipping narcotics into the country should be put to death: "You import commercial quantities of drugs in the United States for the purpose of destroying our children, we will kill you."


Senator Threatens Fight on Floor to Press Demand for Public Hearing on Packwood
Senator Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who has led the crusade for public hearings into accusations of sexual and official misconduct against Senator Bob Packwood, threatened today to force a floor vote on the matter unless the Ethics Committee votes within one week to hold such hearings.
Her threat follows one from Senator Mitch McConnell, chairman of the Ethics Committee, in the escalating partisan feud over the Packwood case.
Mr.
McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, told the committee earlier this week that if Mrs.
Boxer kept pushing for public hearings on Mr.
Packwood, a Republican, then he would order hearings into Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Democrat, and Chappaquiddick.

Seles, Seeding Uncertain, Enters U.S. Open
MONICA SELES yesterday entered the United States Open, her first Grand Slam event since she was stabbed in the back in 1993.
"We couldn't be happier," PAGE CROSLAND, director of communications for the United States Tennis Association, said.
"We were anticipating it. We've been waiting for her and we're delighted."
It has not been determined whether Seles will be seeded, whether she will have a ranking that would put her in the main draw, or whether she will be granted a wild card for the tournament, which begins Aug. 28 at Flushing Meadows.


Beliefs; Why the liberal agenda might one day include the battle over euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Are euthanasia and assisted suicide about to become part of the liberal agenda?
That question is raised by the case of George Delury, a Manhattan man charged with second-degree manslaughter after he willingly acknowledged helping his wife, who was incapacitated mentally and physically from multiple sclerosis, kill herself.
Until now, most big battles over euthanasia or assisted suicide have occurred on the West Coast in court cases and in referendums at the polls, or in Michigan where Dr.
Jack Kevorkian has made himself a kind of composite of the Lone Ranger and the Grim Reaper.
Despite national media attention, euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been plotted on the ideological grid.


10-Year Extension for Cincinnati's Coach
BOB HUGGINS, who passed up a possible National Basketball Association coaching job with Miami to remain at the University of Cincinnati, has signed a 10-year contract extension.
The extension grants Huggins more than $700,000 annually in salary and incentives and includes an annuity, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported yesterday.
In six years, Huggins's teams at Cincinnati are 138-58.
The Bearcats have gone to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament each of the last four years.
In 14 years as a head coach, Huggins is 306-130. (AP)


Why I Don't Need Toll Booth Operators
To the Editor:
As I whizzed up the New Jersey Turnpike the other morning on the way to work, my sympathy for the striking toll booth attendants was tempered by my delight at driving from Exit 14 to Exit 16E in seven minutes.
It's a trip that I typically allot a half-hour for.
And it often ends up longer due to the gridlock at the ticket booths during rush hour.


United States Gives Up Nothing In a Stunning Soccer Victory
In a stunning upset at the America Cup tournament, the United States national team achieved one of its biggest international victories tonight by crushing Argentina, 3-0, and advancing to the quarterfinal round.
The triumph was the first for the United States against Argentina and enriched the chances that the interim American coach, Steve Sampson, widely expected to be replaced in favor of an international coach with more experience, will get the job full time.


Billion-Dollar Bet on New Casino
Casino industry giants Mirage Resorts and Circus Circus laid down a billion dollars yesterday on a new 4,000-room casino hotel complex.
The project, on a 178-acre site in the marina district, will consist of twin 31-story hotel towers and a 115,000-square-foot-casino, said the chairman of Mirage, Steve Wynn, who sold the Golden Nugget casino here in 1987 and vowed never to return because of what he considered overzealous regulation.
Mr.
Wynn said restrictions lured him back, The Associated Press reported.
Ground breaking for the project - which is to generate 14,000 jobs - could come early next year.


When Machines, Not Humans, Are the Kings of a Concert
Ever since the advent of machines and computers, humans have been wrestling with the problem of how much technology they should allow to impinge on their daily lives.
To avoid a Frankenstein situation -- that of a powerful, self-operating invention run amok -- society has embraced a future that incorporates the Internet and interactive technology.
These are innovations that derive their use solely from interplay with humans as opposed to autonomous machines that operate or make decisions on their own, a more fear-provoking alternative because these independent computers rob human beings of their specialness and make clear the possibility that they can be replaced by devices more intelligent and industrious than themselves.


Devils Say the Escape Clause Is Essential
The owner of the Devils said yesterday that a provision in the tentative lease agreement reached Thursday that would trigger an escape clause if the Yankees moved to New Jersey was essential to his business future.
"I've got the Rangers across the river and if I had the Yankees here, I'd be decimated," the owner, John McMullen, said.


Prosecutor of Susan Smith Offers a Small Compromise
As the jury selection process dragged on today, the prosecutor in the Susan Smith murder trial said he would be willing to let the presiding judge determine her fate if she pleaded guilty to drowning her two sons.
But that deal would offer Mrs.
Smith only a 50-50 chance of avoiding the electric chair, legal experts said, and she would have much better odds of escaping the death penalty if she took her chances with a jury of 12.

Murder of Bronx Teacher Leaves Police Puzzled
At first the shooting death of Barbara Eastmond, a remedial reading teacher at Public School 14 in Throgs Neck, appeared to be the result of a botched robbery.
She left her family's liquor store in Harlem late Wednesday and headed home to the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx.
She stopped there to pick up her dog and then set out to park the car.
She rented a driveway around the corner because it was difficult to find parking in front of her house.

"I ran a little today and some lady screamed, 'Don't run! Please, don't run!' " she said.


Sports of The Times; Heroes, Icons and Monuments
EARLIER this week, a small group of amateur athletics officials gathered in Manhattan to celebrate a monumental moment in track and field as the New York Athletic Club became the official home of the Jesse Owens International Trophy.
Since 1981, the trophy has been awarded annually to the amateur or Olympic athlete who best personifies the qualities attributed to Owens: great athletic achievement, sportsmanship and a sincere commitment to cooperation among people of all nations.


Drought Conditions Pull Reservoir Levels Down
WITH water levels in the New York City reservoir system dropping below normal -- only 82.2 percent full -- meteorologists said last week that it would take a hurricane to reverse the drought conditions plaguing the region.
Scattered thundershowers during the week dropped from one to two inches of rain on parts of the county but failed to provide the uniform soaking necessary.
"One nice little hurricane would be more like it," said George McKillop, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service.
"That would do the trick."


102 Degrees: You Call That Hot? Look Back
July 9, 1936
It was hot yesterday, but it's been hotter.
On July 9, 1936, temperatures reached 106 degrees at the Central Park Observatory, melting asphalt roadways and killing seven people, accordingj to the front page of The New York Times on July 10, 1936.
But a glance at the headline does not reveal the whole scorching story.
The headline quoted the official high of 102.3 degrees, which was measured from the roof of the Whitehall Building in lower Manhattan and tempered by bay breezes.
But the third paragraph of the story reports the high at Central Park as being 106 in the shade at 5 P.M.
The Central Park reading was recorded as the official high, making it the hottest day in the city's history.
Charles Benjamin Kimble, 99, startled his family on that day, a two-paragraph story on the front page says, when he left his home in Fort Lee, N.J., and walkedj a mile to the center of town and back.
"In his trhee-hour absense Mrs. Lillian Reimers, his daughter, whith whome he lives, called the police in fear the old man had succumbed to the extreme temperature," the article says.
"Mr. Kimble was disgusted when he heard of this on his return. He said he had gone down to the village to 'see how things looked," and 'there was no need to kick up such a fuss.
'You'd think I was 10 years old instead of just shor of a 100,' he said. 'I'm old enough take care of myself.' " July 21, 1977
The city's second hottest day came on July 21, 1977, when temperatures reached 104.
Nestled between the headlines about looting in the streets of Washington during a blackout and bids for the Soviets to limit missles, The New York Times ran a front page story about the blistering heat.
"New Yorkers clung to air-conditioned offices and the shady sides of streets when they had to venture out," the story read.
"Tourists adjusted their schedules to include cooler actractions." LYNETTE HOLLOWAY


Foreign Affairs; Time For Truth
When American officials resign in protest it's usually a headline for a day and then forgotten.
That was certainly the case with George Kenney, the State Department desk officer for Yugoslavia, who was the first official to resign in protest -- August 1992 -- over the failure of the U.S. to intervene in Bosnia.
At the time of his resignation, Mr.
Kenney had never actually been to Yugoslavia, but since then he has traveled through, and written extensively on, the Balkans.
The result is that Mr.
Kenney is no longer an advocate of intervention.
In a lengthy interview, he argued that the only realistic option now for the U.S. and its allies is to focus on moving the parties to a negotiated settlement, based on the power realities on the ground.
It is time, he says, for a bad peace, because that is the only one available.


Movies This Week
LOOK for some golden movie moments on television this week.
In Richard Boleslawski's THEODORA GOES WILD (1936), Irene Bunne as a shy villager who has written a steamy best seller abruptly descends on her Manhattan publisher like a cyclone, complete with Russian wolfhound.
"Another thing," she hurls at the cowed staffers, "I want more publicity!" What an entrance!
The sedate Miss Dunne's official thaw in light comedy (opposite the game Melvyn Douglas) followed some "Show Boat" rakishness.
Then "The Awful Truth" with Cary Grant hit the jackpot.
For now, viva Theodora! -- Wednesday at 8 A.M. on Cinemax.
Early on in John Ford's great GRAPES OF WRATH (1940), with her family ready to head west, Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) sifts through mementos, like a World's Fair postcard to the plaintive "Red River Valley" on harmonica.
Dig the road-stop scene with the hungry Joad children eyeing a candy display.
It's straight out of John Steinbeck -- Monday at 10 P.M. and 2:10 A.M. on Amercian Movie Classics.
In a chuckly bit from Henry Koster's FLOWER DRUM SONG (1961), a young immigrant (Miyoski Umeki, in photograph) asks directions from a Chinese-American in San Francisco.
"Sorry, sister," she's told, "I don't speak Chinese." Miss Umeki is charming when she sings "I Am Going to Like It Here," from the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage score.
So is Nancy Kwan with "I Enjoy Being Girl." Sold -- Sunday at 10:30 P.M. on Disney.
A breathless moment from Fritz Lang's murky masterpiece, M (1931), shows a child-killer (Peter Lorre), flung before his captors and jury -- criminal Berlin.
Look at those faces -- Saturday at 9 P.M. on CUNY.
Through the swamp in Preston's Sturges's SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS (1941), a line of shuffling, shackled convicts (including Joel McCrea, as a misplaced Hollywood director) joins a poor, black congregation to watch a cartoon.
Minutes later, the church rocks with laughter -- Friday at 10 P.M. and 3 P.M. on American Movie Classics.

Man Is Arrested In Halloween Death
It started in an incident last Halloween with egg-throwing, escalated to bottles, and by the time it was over Angel Lopez Almodovar, a mechanic who was bringing a tricycle home to his 4-year-old son in Brooklyn, had been shot to death.
Nine months later, the police arrested a 20-year-old man and charged him with the murder.
The man, Hector Suarez, was arrested Thursday night and charged with second-degree murder, Officer Kathleen Kelly, a police spokeswoman, said.


'Emblems of Mind'
To the Editor:
Kendall L. Walton obfuscates some important points through careless use of musical terminology.
By writing that "men's and women's vocal ranges are approximately an octave apart, which allows them to sing in unison" (my emphasis), he fails to distinguish between unison (pitches of the same frequency) and octave (pitches whose frequencies vibrate in the ratio 2:1).
Yes, men and women can sing in unison, but only in the segments of their ranges that overlap -- at the higher end for men, lower for women.
In other words, if these ranges were less than an octave apart (or if they were identical), we would be able to sing in unison much more readily.


Star Ratings Don't Tell Entire Story

To and From N.Y. Airports
NOW that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has announced that it cannot build a new rail link from midtown Manhattan to Kennedy International Airport, the metropolitan area remains wedded to its three major airports by road only.
Subways make most, but not all, of the trip: the A train to Howard Beach connects to a free bus that passes through parking lots to loop around the Kennedy terminals; the E, F, G, R and 7 subway lines also require a bus trip for the last leg.
The other choices encompass private cars, taxis, buses, vans and car services.


Lingering in Languedoc
I'VE been to France often, and happily, but never have I been as enthralled as I was on a trip last June to the valley of the Herault River in Languedoc.
In part it was the landscape.
All around were dramatic vistas of distant, rugged mountains and deep ravines, punctuated by placid vineyards and sprawls of mysterious stone towns.
In part, too, it was those towns, which up close proved to be twists of narrow streets that climbed to ancient chateaus and seemed untouched by modernity.
I was in the Herault to visit cousins who had rented a house -- sight unseen, from a newspaper ad -- in the tiny town of Brissac-le-Haut, population 40.
I had flown from Paris to the nearest big city, Montpellier, and there my cousins met me and drove me to their house 28 miles away, along a route that started out straight but soon became steep and filled with what the French call lacets, shoelace turns.

Major league baseball has died.
Not at the ticket office or the negotiating table, but when Barry Bonds failed to turn around.
At the time, baseball owners were meeting in Minneapolis to address a problem of dwindling attendance.
They attempted to solve the crisis by decreasing the duration of the game.
All the while, in Candlestick Park, Barry Bonds was presiding over the burial of the sport when he failed to chase a fly hit by Met catcher Kelly Stinnett.


Columbus Aria: The Noisy Art Of Dining Out
A worker lifts an electric saw from the ground and begins to cut through a steel pipe on Columbus Avenue just north of 77th Street.
The ear-splitting whine rips through the midday air.
Across 77th Street, lunchtime diners at the large outdoor cafe of Isabella's restaurant continue with their salads and sandwiches.
They never turn to look.
"We were so engrossed in our conversation, we didn't even notice the construction," said Tony Pinelli, who had just finished his lunch.
"Actually, I didn't notice it until we crossed the street and it was in our way."

Wrong Direction on Malpractice
In reforming product liability laws, the House has passed misguided restrictions on the ability of patients to sue doctors and hospitals for malpractice.
The Senate dropped medical malpractice from its product-liability bill, but the House provisions remain alive in the conference committee.
Sponsors say Federal legislation is needed because lopsided jury verdicts are saddling blameless physicians with huge malpractice premiums and forcing them to practice defensive medicine -- administering needless tests and procedures to ward off later claims of negligence when patients suffer unavoidable bad outcomes.

Her father is a professor of English at Trinity College and is a poet.


Uninvited Guests, Hungry but Often Amiable
THERE are several stone walls on the property, so sooner or later, it was bound to happen.
Chipmunks have moved in.
Perhaps it would be more accurate to say a chipmunk has moved in.
So far, it appears to be without a mate.
But this is not to be counted on; the chipmunk is, after all, a family type.
Although no nest has been discovered, this forager's hiding place has -- the downspout of a roof gutter.


Branson, Mo.
Branson, Mo., accommodates two kinds of visitors: those who want to be entertained in air-conditioned theaters for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and those who come to fish or to explore the ancient mountains shading misty streams and caves in their green, piney folds.
The area has long courted tourists.
In 1907, a New Yorker named Harold Bell Wright published "The Shepherd of the Hills," a novel based on the lives of Ozark Mountain people living in nearby Mutton Hollow.
The book was a best seller and people began journeying to the area, traveling by train to Hollister, Mo., a couple of miles south of Branson.

Jets' Rebuilding Starts on the Line
When a National Football League team finishes a season with a 6-10 record and averages only 16.5 points a game (25th in the league) and only 293.9 yards in total offense (22d in the league) and rushes for 100 yards a game only six times, it's time for a change.
The Jets have made plenty of changes on offense, leaving them with no seasoned wide receivers, a wide-open competition at tailback and almost an entirely new offensive line.
Receivers can usually be found.
Tailbacks can usually step in quickly.
But pro football wisdom holds that offensive lines take two or three years to develop, that the linemen need that time to blend and play as a unit because teamwork is more important on the offensive line than anywhere else.

July 9-15: Quiet Zealots; Palestinian Militants Back Down in Gaza
The confrontation between Yasir Arafat and the militant Palestinian Islamic zealots opposed to the peace plan in Gaza has been building up over the past year.
There have been dire warnings of a civil war and a bloodbath .
But this month, when Mr.
Arafat ordered his security forces to crack down on the militants, the reaction was anti-climactic: the militants backed down from their threats to go to war against the Palestinian Authority, as Mr.
Arafat's government is known.
Even when the Palestinian police went about arresting scores of Islamic militants who had vowed to fight if challenged, there was no fight.
Instead, the militants redrew their red lines around the modest goal of preserving their infrastructure of schools, mosques and social institutions.
"The men are easy to replace, institutions are not," a senior official of Hamas, the fundamentalist opposition group said in an interview last week in Gaza, adding that a civil war is the furthest thing from the group's mind.
Both Palestinians and Israelis say they fully expect further acts of terror by the militants.
What has changed, they insist, is the power of these acts to freeze the peace plan.

New Concerns Raised Over a Computer Smut Study
Growing controversy over a widely publicized study of on-line computer pornography, conducted by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, has prompted the university to investigate whether the research violated ethical or academic guidelines.
The investigation follows the disclosure by angry faculty members that an undergraduate student and his principal faculty adviser at Carnegie Mellon spied on the private computer habits of nearly 3,000 students, staff members and other faculty members last year as part of the research study into pornography viewing habits.


Trying to Gauge Feasibility or Folly of 42d St. Trolley
After nearly two decades of debate, a host of studies and preliminary approval by the City Council, the 42d Street trolley project has reached a critical juncture.
Decisions now being made will determine whether the project lives or dies.
The last trolley on 42d Street rolled to a stop in 1946.
"I'm hopeful the city will act now so it can get the trolley running before another 50 years pass," said Janette Sadik-Khan, an official of the Federal Transit Administration.
With conservative politics and tightened budgets at all levels of government, such projects will be less likely in the future, she said.

Two Top Picks Reach Contract Terms
The start of training camp again is proving to be more of an incentive to signing first-round draft choices than the National Football League's rookie salary cap was.

Move Over, Cows: This Isn't the County Fair You Remember
It's opening night at the Ocean County Fair, and in the incubator, chick No. 1 emerges from the wreckage of its brown shell to test its stubby wings.
At the other end of the tent, 13-year-old Jackie Witt of Toms River, returning champion exhibitor of guinea pigs, rabbits and ducks, is hoping that Tyson, her beautiful but belligerent Plymouth Barred rooster, will add to her trophies.
But though it may be business as usual in the poultry tent, the Ocean County Fair, like most of the 21 agricultural fairs around the state, is changing.
As the county's grazing land gets swallowed up by development, competitions involving large livestock are disappearing in favor of rabbit and cat shows.
Booths offering POG milk caps and cellular phone service have displaced the traditional displays of tractors and combines.

Carpenters' Union Readies For Supervised Election
The job now pays $360,791 a year, and on Thursday voting begins to determine who will get it: the presidency of the carpenters' union in the New York region, a union long beleaguered by corruption and mobsters.
As part of a government drive to reform the union, the election will be overseen by court-appointed monitors and investigators.
And for the first time, the president and other officials will be elected by the membership instead of by delegates chosen by leaders of union locals.

Crusader for New York City Landmarks Moves On
ANYONE who has ever felt blessed walking through the Beaux-Arts grandeur of cavernous Grand Central Terminal -- or has felt frustrated grappling with the regulations designed to protect New York City's landmarks -- owes something to Kent L. Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society.
Over two decades Mr.
Barwick has become one of the leading crusaders for preserving the city's notable buildings.
His work in the 70's in preventing the construction of an office tower on top of Grand Central Terminal not only preserved what is part of the city's heart, but also led to a United States Supreme Court ruling that established the right of local governments to preserve architecturally distinctive sites and structures.

But his agent, LON ROSEN, said Johnson's remarks were taken out of context.

The only item the vandals took was a photograph of Ms.

After a tour in Jordan, the Sinai, Israel and the West Bank I returned to Amman for the flight home.

They wanted a cozy house, not a cookie-cutter house, something that would make them feel joyful, in an enveloping neighborhood.
They wanted to spend $250,000 to $350,000.

Water War: Is This River Big Enough for Rowboats and Jet Skis?
Lambertville is a quiet town of 4,500, with flower-laced lanes, Revolutionary War cottages, an annual shad festival -- and, more recently, boutiques and stylish restaurants that have spilled across the Delaware River from the antiquing capital of New Hope, Pa.
These days, however, Lambertville isn't always quiet.
Almost any summer afternoon, you can hear the roar of jet skis on the river -- and, sometimes, loud arguments between jet skiers and environmentalists like George Grother, a founder of the Delaware River Coalition and member of the Swan Creek Rowing Club.


Doll House Party
WITH AN INHERITANCE FROM THEIR FAMILY, WEALTHY GERMAN-JEWS, THE Stettheimer sisters -- Florine, Ettie and Carrie -- were the very models of "the new woman," as the French art critic Marius Ary-Leblond described the feminist of 1901.
The new woman, he wrote, lives "a full life, a complete and powerful one, equal in intensity and output to that of a man." Indeed, the Stettheimers declared men impossible but worthy of flirtation.
They wore pants, smoked cigarettes, disdained marriage, romance and children, and were constantly surrounded by artists and writers who were drawn to their soigne gatherings.
They were inseparable, those Stettheimers, possibly a reaction to their father's desertion shortly after Ettie's birth.
They lived with their mother here and abroad, and life was a series of quiet luxuries.
Florine painted, Ettie wrote two fairly obscure novels, "Philosophy" and "Love Days," under the pseudonym Henrie Waste (Henrietta Walter Stettheimer); Carrie's chief contribution to the family was managing its domestic and worldly affairs, which included overseeing what the art critic Henry McBride described as one of the most intellectual salons of the day.


Dispirited Armstrong Comes Oh So Close
Lance Armstrong, the American leader of the Motorola team, came so close -- a bicycle length or two at most -- to winning a stage of the Tour de France today, an achievement he had been thinking about for more than two weeks.
"I like this one, too," he said, gesturing to a profile handout of this 13th of 20 daily stages before the Tour began in Brittany on July 1.
"It'll be hot and I like that, and all these ups and downs, I like that." His analysis was perfect.


Jackpot! The Lowly Slot Is a Cash Cow
SLOT machines are like pop songs, offering minute variations on established themes, with hooks to grab your attention.
Some of them actually talk, telling the gambler in a coy digital voice, "Fill me up," or "You look like a winner."
They flash and pop and twinkle with multicolored charts that reveal a bewildering combination of payouts.
The 25-cent machine that Norma Silverstein of Camden County is playing at the Trump Taj Mahal this morning has a handle that sets the fruit salad combinations spinning, as well as a button that does the same thing.
But the button merely clicks; the handle comes down with an audible, ratcheting, satisfying crrrrunch.

Fanfares, Marches And More
FOR the last five summers, hundreds of music lovers in Woodbury have been entertained by the Waterbury Symphony, and on Saturday afternoon the group's music director, Leif Bjaland, makes it six in a row, leading the brass and wind sections of the orchestra in the annual "Picnic and Pops" concert in the Hollow.
The program celebrates the 50th anniversary of V-E Day with marches by John Phillips Sousa, bugle calls by Leroy Anderson, fanfares by Morton Gould and other music from the World War II era.


This Old House: The Agony and Ecstasy
THE old house had everything they wanted: the long winding driveway; the five acres that seemed like 50 because they were surrounded by the pastures of far-flung farms; picturesque weathered gray outbuildings where each could have a painting studio and finally, the quirky old added-to-over-the-years farmhouse with the original slate roof.
It was funny because Lynn and Larry Smith hadn't even set out to find an old house.
In fact, Mr.
Smith says, he would have taken a modern A-frame on the same setting, in the sleepy town of Hope, N.J., near the Pennsylvania border.


The Capitalist; Fidelities
JEFF VINIK WAS SOMEWHERE between the women's shoes and the men's accessories at the Salvatore Ferragamo boutique on Fifth Avenue when he mentioned Silicon Graphics.
He appeared to be trapped in a pincer of several hundred investors, who had come at the behest of Worth Magazine to celebrate his success, when he mentioned, by the by, to a couple of men sipping Champagne that he expected the share price of Silicon Graphics to double.
I believe only a few people heard him, though just about everyone would have liked to.
The economist John Maynard Keynes once described the art of investing as "anticipating what average opinion expects average opinion to be." Vinik represents average opinion.
He runs the Magellan Fund, the huge mutual fund that controls $45 billion of Fidelity Investments' $200 billion portfolio.
The crowd of hundreds trailed closely behind the human bellwether as he left the clothing store and traveled down to the University Club, where he was scheduled to deliver a lecture.
On the way I thought he might drop a further nugget, but when I asked him (discreetly, of course) about the stocks in his portfolio, the only name that he mentioned was Silicon Graphics.
Then he strolled to the podium and explained to a standing-room-only audience that America is in a "boom-boom era, . . . in only the third or fourth inning of the current bull market." His best guess was that the stock market would rise for another 7 to 10 years.


CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: Bosnian Serbs Push Past U.N. Posts Into Muslim Enclave; Europe Unlikely to Act
While European officials indicated today that there was little prospect of using military force in Bosnia to prevent the fall of Zepa, they said they were working on a plan to reinforce United Nations troops in another enclave and in Sarajevo, the capital.
France opened the latest round of diplomatic maneuvering on Thursday when President Jacques Chirac threatened to pull the nearly 4,000 French soldiers in the peacekeeping force out of Bosnia unless the United Nations agreed to take stronger action.
He has proposed using the new European rapid-reaction force to ease the Bosnian Serb siege of Sarajevo and to protect Gorazde.
"If France actually believed that military action could save Zepa and Srebrenica, then no doubt French troops would be marching on Zepa and Srebrenica at this time," the British Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind said today.
"They are not."
Jordan, which has 2,500 troops in Bosnia, also said today that it would pull out if nothing is done to stop Serbian attacks.

Need an Extra Week Off? Visit the Company Store
AS long as there's a market, it seems, everything is available for a price.
In the United States, where the average worker is relatively well-paid but vacation-poor, time off has become a commodity to be bought and sold.
Since the late 1980's, an increasing number of companies -- Du Pont, Quaker Oats, Coca-Cola and American Express among them -- have begun including extra vacation time in their flexible benefits programs.
Hewitt Associates, the employee benefit consulting firm, estimated last September that about 15 percent of American companies let employees buy or sell time, though usually no more than five days a year.


Easy Come, Easy Go: A Cautionary Tale
John Scarne, who lived most of his life in Hudson County (he died in 1985 at the age of 82), was a legendary, street-smart expert on games and gambling.
In his "Complete Guide to Gambling" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1961), he had this to say about slot machines:
Automation came to the gambling industry in 1895, when Charles Fey placed the first nickel-in-the-slot machine in the gambling places of San Francisco.
Today the slot machine, long known as the "one-armed bandit," is without any doubt gambling's most consistent money-maker.
There has never been any other gambling device which has produced such enormous profits with so little effort . . .


Two Weeks of Fresh Air In Suburbs, Pool Included
With the sun glaring in everyone's eyes and the air hanging heavy over the platforms, a crowd of people at the Mineola station eagerly awaited the train from New York City on a recent afternoon.
They were not looking for the usual commuters returning home from a day at work.
They were awaiting a group of close to 20 chatty, giggling, energetic youngsters headed out of the city for two weeks of play, relaxation and, most of all, a change of pace from their daily urban routines.
Among the crowd, Warren Cronacher stood next to his nephew, David Gesuadi, a 10-year-old from Rhode Island, waiting for Crystal Westbrook, 9, to return for her third summer as a Fresh Air child here.

For Employee Benefits, It Pays to Wear the Union Label
American companies are spending more, on average, to provide benefits for their employees.
But sometimes they do so only under pressure, and often added benefits come at the price of smaller pay raises.
Which industries spend the most on benefits?
Companies in industries that are either government regulated or unionized or both.
From a worker's point of view, pressure on the boss pays in terms of benefits.


Introverts, Extroverts And Mothers Who Wait
UPTOWN -- Mark Morris was an emotional fireworks display in his dressing room at the New York State Theater on July 12, and his quiet and unassuming mother, Maxine Morris, seemed to be enjoying the show.
The brash young choreographer had just received a standing ovation at the opening night of his "L'Allegro, Il Penseroso ed Il Moderato," a kind of mood-swing ballet presented as part of Lincoln Center's Serious Fun Festival.
"It was very good," said Mrs.
Morris, who was in a matronly pink dress.
"I didn't see one misstep all night."
Mr.
Morris, who was in a lot of canary yellow, enjoyed watching his work, too, despite the woman sitting behind him.
"She was wearing all these jingly-jangly silver bracelets," he said as he chain-smoked and guzzled a tall can of beer.
"If it had been somebody else's performance, I'd have ripped them off her."
If the evening-length ballet was an abstract depiction of the introvert and the extovert, mother and son were the living embodiment of those bipolar qualities.
"I have a lot of pep," Mr. Morris said.
"You could call him a showoff at times, I guess," said the reticent Mrs.
Morris, as she watched an international crowd lavish compliments on her son.
"It's epic-making!" someone told him.
"What a thrill it is to be here!" someone else added.
The antic Mr.
Morris, in turn, expressed himself in flamboyant language peppered with an occasional obscenity his mother chose to ignore.
"He's not allowed to use profanity at home," she said. "And neither are his friends."
When things had quieted down, mother and son left the dressing room for a reception on the theater's promenade.
"If I'm hanging on to you, it's only because I'm a little tired," said Mrs.
Morris, who had just arrived from Seattle, where, as a toddler, Mr.
Morris hung on to a coffee table in her living room while dancing.
"Don't worry, Mom, I have enough equilibrium for the both of us," he said.
"I just hope there's beer up there." Mrs.
Morris, who doesn't approve of drinking, said she was looking forward to a glass of Coca-Cola.
"It's a fete! It's a fete!" Mr.
Morris yelled as they were welcomed with applause and showered with more compliments.
After an hour, it was time to call it a night.
"They've closed the bar, for Christ's sake," Mr.
Morris said before catching himself and telling his mother he didn't mean to use the Lord's name in vain.
"But, since I'm not a Christian, I can," he added.
His mother didn't care to argue the point.
"Come on, let's blow, Mom," he said.
"O.K.," she said.
"Let's get the hell out of here," he added.
During the fraction of a second that passed, Mrs.
Morris didn't even have to raise an eyebrow.
"I mean," Mr. Morris said, "heck."
Beyond the Red Carpet
It was near midnight on July 5, and a private party welcoming Christy Turlington as a new partner in the Fashion Cafe was still in progress.
April Sandmeyer, a sweet-natured woman with a childlike smile, had been standing with a crowd behind police barricades outside the themey-restaurant at Rockefeller Center for five hours.
"My daughter's inside and I didn't want her to be here alone," Mrs.
Sandmeyer said as thin somebodies like Jay McInerney and Carmen Dell'Orefice came and went on a red carpet in front of a crowd of gawkers who didn't recognize them.
"She loves the modeling world," Mrs.
Sandmeyer said about her daughter, Maria Caballero, 17, who has a part in the new movie "Kids," directed by Larry Clark.
"It's what she really wants to do. She's had a vanity problem since she was 13. It used to take her a minimum of two hours to get ready to go to school, but now that straight hair is back in, she doesn't have to go through quite so many contortions."
Naomi Campbell, who long ago had made a dazzling entrance with her Fashion Cafe partners, Ms.
Turlington, Claudia Schiffer and Elle Macpherson, stepped outside.
"Thanks for coming, everybody," she said before disappearing into a car.
"Please go home now because the party's over."
Mrs.
Sandmeyer, along with the rest of the crowd, held her ground.
"I hope Maria comes out soon," she said as she shifted on her tennis sneakers.
More time passed.
More people who looked important -- Eileen Ford, Kevin Aucoin, Kenny Scharf, Quincy Jones -- came out of the party.
Finally, Ms.
Caballero, a slender, somewhat exotic-looking teen-ager in a blue cocktail dress, appeared with a much older man at her side.
"I'd like to take her to the Whiskey Bar for one drink and then I'll bring her right home," the man told Mrs.
Sandmeyer, who sent him teetering off by himself with her pleasant but unyielding smile.
"This is why I wanted to wait here," she told her daughter, who proceeded to report on the party.
"It was pretty boring," Ms.
Caballero said with the grand ennui of the Manhattan teen-ager.
"The band was good. The food was O.K."
"What about the decor?" her mother asked.
"It was a little cheesy," Ms.
Caballero said, adding that the supermodels in attendance had pretty much kept to themselves all evening and that she was a little disappointed not to have met any modeling agents.
"If I can make a living by standing in front of a camera everyday, I'd love to do that," she said.
"Otherwise, I'll just be a recording artist." Her mother muttered something about attending college first; then, she inquired about Ms.
Macpherson's skintight, somewhat diaphanous pants.
"Was that her underwear you could see underneath?" Mrs. Sandmeyer asked.
"It was a red thong," Ms. Caballero answered.
Having established that essential point, it was time to go home.
And not by bus, either.
"I'm taking you home by cab, Mom," she said.


Jordanian Is Lionized In Israel
In the three months since he arrived as Jordan's first Ambassador to Israel, Marwan Muasher has become a celebrity, although sometimes a reluctant one.
He is a sought-after guest at dinners and receptions.
He has appeared on television.
He gives lectures.
He has been interviewed by the Israeli press.


Crossing Over, the Old-Fashioned Way
THESE DAYS, CROSSOVER recordings are most often marketing ploys for performers.
Put, say, Luciano Pavarotti and Bryan Adams together, and let them trade phrases in a middlebrow ballad as they indulge in some synchronized mugging for the television cameras.
No one pretends that anything musically innovative is going on.
But in the early part of this century, especially the 20's and 30's, many popular and classical musicians were intensely curious about what was going on across the way.
In their pursuit of innovation artists from different traditions not only crossed the borders that divided them, they also settled in for a while on the other turf, tried on the local costumes, picked up a few mementos and took them home.


Sarah Smith, J. D. Klingbeil Jr.
Sarah Stuart Macaulay Smith, a daughter of Jane S. M. Smith of Washington and the late Thomas William Macaulay Smith, was married yesterday to James David Klingbeil Jr., a son of Sally A. Klingbeil and James D. Klingbeil of San Francisco.
The Rev.
Canon Donald F. Boyer performed the ceremony at St.
James Episcopal Church in Woodstock, Vt.
Mrs.
Klingbeil, 28, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, as did her husband, and received a master's degree in reading and language education from the University of California at Berkeley.
Until recently she was a first-grade teacher at the Town School in San Francisco.


When Television Is an Open Book
WHEN the summer heat is so thick it shimmers, there are two excellent ways to get cool: run through a sprinkler's mist or go to a library and read near the air-conditioner.
Two public television series and a special are intended to send young readers to the stacks.
On the special, "Celebrate Storytelling" (Channel 13, Sunday, July 23 at noot), Kelly McGillis wanders into a book-filled room to introduce two Hans Christian Andersen stories.
She tells "Thumbelina," and Glenn Close narrates "The Emperor and the Nightingale."
On "Storytime" (Channel 13, weekdays at 10:30 A.M., Channel 31 Monday through Thursday at 3:30 P.M.), which just began its second year on PBS, celebrites stop by a library set to read a story and chat with a puppet named Kino.
On Monday, for example, John Goodman drops in to read "Little Polar Bear," by Hans de Beer, and "Rose Meets Mr. Wintergarten," by Bob Graham.
"Reading Rainbow" (Channel 13, weekdays at 4 P.M.; Channel 21, weekdays at 9:30 A.M.), which has been on the air since 1983, uses a book as a starting point for an adventure, activity or discussion, and offers children's mini-reviews of related books.
On one show LeVar Burton, the host, follows a 17-year-old girl who has always wanted to be a pilot on her first flight, and Linda Lavin reads "Ruth Law Thrills a Nation," by Don Brown.
Mr.
Burton plays with light, and Robert Guillaume reads Robert Louis Stevenson's poem "My Shadow."
While Congress and parents cluck over the state of pop culture and its effects on children, programs like these continue to show that there are signs of intelligent life on television.
Far from the din of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, beyond the known quantities of "Sesame Street" and "Barney," the programs exist like small, calm islands, waiting for children and their parents to happen upon them.
The pace is slow, leaving room for imagination.
The stories unfold as the camera lingers on illustrations.
Some are minimally animated.
Musical touches enhance the dramatic ebbs and flows.
If a child can slow down long enough to be drawn in, the effect can be mesmerizing.
These programs are meant to jog parents to read to their children, and to prompt children to ask them to.
Julie Cummins, the coordinator of children's services for the New York Public Library, said the New York City public schools have increased their push to keep pupils reading over the summer.
Those who do, she said, "keep up their level of conprehension and don't have to catch up when they get back to school."
The books that are read on the shows are a mix of the familiar and the new.
The pattern between stories shows how books can start conversations.
And on "Storytime," seeing a grown-up curled up with a couple of kids on a couch is a reminder that children -- and parents -- need physical closeness to thrive and that reading together is one way to be close.
Is anybody tuning in?
Ms.
Cummins said that when it can, the library tries to make available the books on "Reading Rainbow."
"Showing people reading, and valuing reading, passes along that value to children," she said.
"Anything that makes a connection between books and enjoyment is O.K. in our book."

Bosnia Lets Refugees Leave Camp But 20,000 Others Are Missing
As thousands of Muslim refugees from Srebrenica were moved from a wretched camp outside the airport here in northeastern Bosnia, United Nations officials said today that about 20,000 other Srebrenica refugees were unaccounted for.
"There are 20,000 or so people missing, and we have not been able to trace them," said Yuri Shishayev, a United Nations spokesman in Tuzla, 45 miles northeast of Srebrenica.
"Most of them are men of draft age, and the Serbs' stated position is that they have been taken away for screening. But given the manner in which they carried out the operation in Srebrenica, I think we have some grounds to fear the worst."

Hot! Hot! Hot! The Sweaters Of Summer
Summer sweaters are not only a style statement, but also a necessity on even the hottest days as a comfortable protection against air-conditioning's too-often frigid blast.
The long sleeves of a sweater, looped around the shoulders, may be a traditional look, but they become a fashion statement when added to this summer's revival of classic sportswear or the sleeveless linen sheath dress.
From the Gap to Chanel, the summer's big favorite appears to be the twin-sweater set in matching colors, in either cardigan or pullover style.
The newest twin sets are the short-sleeved cardigans (top, far left).
The summer sweaters come in a wide range of knits: cotton, linens and blends of natural and synthetic yarns.


Ms. Hemmer and Mr. Schlingmann
Jennifer Ann Hemmer, the daughter of Camille H. Hemmer of Sacramento, Calif., and John F. Hemmer of Redondo Beach, Cailf., was married yesterday to Matthias Schlingmann, a son of Erika Schlingmann of Asemissen, Germany, and the late Herbert Schlingmann.
Judge Philip V. Sarkisian of the Superior Court of Alameda County in California officiated at a private residence in Tahoe City, Calif.
Ms.
Hemmer, who is 30 and is keeping her name, is a sponsorship account manager at Soccer USA Partners, a sports marketing agency in New York.
She graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and received a master's degree in international affairs from Columbia University.


Ideas &amp; Trends; The Spies' Code And How It Broke
TO the human brain, with its insatiable hunger for order, nothing is more disorienting than randomness.
Soviet cryptographers knew this well when they set out to devise a code for communicating with the spy ring that included Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
With a system as simple as it was ingenious, they tried to insure that any message intercepted by United States intelligence agents would seem as meaningless as the snow on a television set tuned to an empty station.
But pure, unadulterated randomness can be extremely difficult to manufacture.
As was revealed last week after decades of secrecy, in a ceremony at the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters, the Russians suffered from a lapse in quality control.
They inadvertently let some pattern find its way into their scrambled codes, a loose thread that allowed American code breakers to unravel the scheme slowly.


Documents Were Destroyed as F.B.I. Resisted Siege Investigation, Report Says
A Justice Department report not yet made public on the F.B.I.'s standoff with a white separatist in Idaho shows that in late 1992 and early 1993 -- the period during which Bureau officials are suspected of destroying documents about the incident -- F.B.I. managers were frantically trying to block Federal prosecutors from obtaining the Bureau's records on the case.
Justice Department investigators, who uncovered the document destruction in recent weeks, have found that a career F.B.I. official stripped the files of official records that would have clearly shown if top F.B.I. officials in Washington were in command of the ill-fated operation.

In Bach's 'Goldbergs,' Practice Makes Partly Perfect
IF I WERE IN A CRITICAL FRAME OF MIND, there would be no end of caviling: here an unevenness in 64th-note passages, there the loss of an inner voice, elsewhere a failure to differentiate timbral qualities between sections.
More practice is needed in one spot, more attention to the harmonic progression in another, more dissection of difficult passages throughout.
But I am patient and long-suffering. For I am also the player.


THE DEADLIEST D.A.
THE PHONE RANG IN DAVE WEBB'S downtown Philadelphia apartment at 7:15 on the morning of April 23, 1991.
Webb, 42, was acting chief of homicide in the prosecutor's office, soon to be appointed chief by the new District Attorney, Lynne Abraham.
Homicide detectives needed Webb's approval before making an arrest or getting a search warrant.
And since local killers showed little respect for the sleep of local prosecutors, the phone rang all night -- on one particularly nasty night, Webb got 12 calls, on four killings, between 11 P.M. and 6 A.M.
Receiving a call at 7:15 was a luxury.
"Looks like it's going to be a double," William Gross, a detective, told Webb.
"One's already gone, the other one is shot in the head." The dead man, 26-year-old Ricardo Thomas, had apparently been shot in the head while sleeping.
He was still in the fetal position when the body was discovered on a couch in the southwest Philadelphia house of Lisa Johnson, 22, who had been shot in the head as she lay on another couch.
Her father had discovered them when he came downstairs at 6 A.M.


Mari-Jo Winkler, Edward A. Ioffreda
Mari-Jo Winkler, a daughter of Norman and JoAnne Winkler of Orchard Park, N.Y., was married at her parent's house yesterday to Edward Andrew Ioffreda, a son of Dr.
Pasqualino F. Ioffreda of Highland Park, N.J., and the late Lois Ioffreda.
Lois Kellerman, the Senior Leader of the Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture, performed the ceremony.
Mrs.
Winkler-Ioffreda, 28, and her husband, 30, are freelance production supervisors in the motion picture industry.
The bride, a graduate of American University, is currently the production supervisor for the screen adaptation of Arthur Miller's "The Crucible," for 20th Century Fox.
Mr.
Winkler-Ioffreda, a graduate of New York University, was until recently an assistant to a producer of "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar," a Universal Pictures film.

A Magic Bus for a Weekend Or for a Long, Strange Trip
VOLKSWAGEN campers are fine for camping, but for many people they may not be practical as everyday transportation.
Their lackluster performance can be a nuisance while commuting, and a conventional station wagon or mini-van offers similar flexibility for carrying people and cargo -- with considerably better road manners.
And how often does one go camping?
In lieu of buying a VW camper, renting one may be an option.
Three American companies specialize in renting the vehicles for camping and vacation travel, offering adventurers the opportunity to drive, eat, sleep and generally make their home inside a VW van for a minimum of three days.
Prices vary by company and season, with the cost of a three-day rental ranging from a base charge of $195 to $345 with unlimited mileage.
The typical excursion taken by customers of each company lasts a week to 10 days and covers nearly 1,000 miles.


Loving Parents for Highways
Some New Jerseyans are hitting the road this summer; others are cleaning it up.
Since May, more than two dozen organizations have joined the Department of Transportation's Adopt-a-Highway program, bringing the total to 678 groups and an estimated 4,000 volunteers since the program's start in 1991.


THE NEW JAZZ AGE
I'm a 20-year-old student at Williams College, and despite my father's talk of the good old days, I never cared for jazz in my childhood.
Maybe my musical sensibilities have matured because now I am one of four or five D.J.'s hosting a weekly jazz show at our college radio station, WCFM.
Conroy's article was a great way for me to put my recent musical change of heart into perspective.


The Rib Tickler's Approach to Social Provocation
MORE THAN RATINGS ARE at stake for Michael Moore this summer as his sometimes loopy, sometimes acidly satiric news-magazine program, "TV Nation," returns to prime time.
His whole world view is on the line.
Mr.
Moore, the iconoclastic film maker who is destined to have his name followed forever by the phrase "producer and director of the award-winning documentary 'Roger and Me,' " says his career is propelled by the conviction that Americans are smarter and more politically sophisticated than the television industry thinks.


Veterans and Young Performers at Caramoor
SOME of the most revered artists mix and match with young performers this week at the Caramoor Festival.
This afternoon at 5:30, for instance, Alicia de Larrocha and Andre Previn offer four-hand Mozart, after which Mr.
Previn joins some so-called rising stars, Ayako Yoshida and Wendy Warner (an Avery Fisher Career Grant Award-winner several years ago), for the Mendelssohn D minor Trio.
On Thursday afternoon at 4:15, another young-artist pairing brings the violin-piano duo of Maria Bachmann and Jon Klibonoff to the Spanish Courtyard for sonatas by Ravel, Saint-Saens and John Corigliano.

Ancient Mariners
Twenty years ago, there were only a couple of T-shirt stores in Provincetown, Mass.
The town's currency had long since shifted from fishing to tourism, but the town's pride ran deep and local merchants were shy about exploiting the Provincetown image.
That reticence didn't last.
Now there seem to be as many T-shirt stores as there are shoppers.
But for those of us who have always worshiped the spirit of the place, a quiet society still exists.
This fraternity is apparent in the arch of a brow and the roll of an eye exchanged in summer between people who have weathered the winter on the fragile tip of Cape Cod.
Popular among us is the big T-shirt of the summer of 1975, the one with "Provincetown, the Last Resort" written across it.
It means that geography is either fate or choice, that you are either born in Provincetown and unable to leave or you came for a weekend and never left.
In either case, a destiny is shared.

After the Fall: 2 Faces of Mexico's Economy
MOST Wednesdays, at precisely 2 P.M., Government officials gather here at the ornate National Palace to give the latest figures on declining inflation, surging stock prices and other positive signs of Mexico's steady climb back to economic stability.
While the good news is being related inside, unemployed Mexican workers sometimes mill outside on the huge Plaza of the Constitution, occasionally swaggering up to a microphone facing the palace windows.
They are hungry, they call out, and they are angry because the Government is forcing them to pay for getting the nation's economy back on track.


July 9-15: Lethal Bites; The Tick that Brought Lyme Disease Now Brings Death
Just in case humans weren't repulsed enough by Ixodes scapularis, the deer tick, scientists last week provided a new reason for fear and loathing.
The tiny parasite, made infamous from Nantucket to Minnesota for its ability to transmit Lyme disease, has now been shown to harbor a lethal bacterial illness, called human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, or H.G.E.
The human infection, first identified in several dozen cases in Wisconsin and Minnesota, has stricken a dozen residents of New York City suburbs in the first few weeks of this year's summer tick-bite season.
The infection can cause sudden severe flu-like symptoms and, if not treated with the appropriate antibiotics, can become life-threatening, researchers say.
Previously implicated in at least four deaths, H.G.E. is suspected most recently in the case of a New York man who ended up the intensive care unit at a New York City hospital last month.
He quickly healed once the right drugs took hold.
It's possible for a single tick bite to transmit Lyme, H.G.E., and even perhaps a third known infectious organism, a protozoan called babesia, said Dr.
J.
Stephen Dumler, a microbiologist at the University of Maryland, who is testing for H.G.E. infections using DNA analysis similar to that used in the O.J.
Simpson trial.
"It's pretty scary," he said, "if you think about what's inside of a tick." ANDREW C. REVKIN

I put the lock up myself because I live in this very famous old house and tourists come to look at it.
The first week I owned the place, people showed up in my living room.


From Wonder Boy to Leader
It could be more than a coincidence that the same people who sponsor Jeff Gordon also make Teflon.
During one of his personal appearances at the Du Pont corporate headquarters, stock car racing's newest phenom must have acquired his own nonstick surface.
Dale Earnhardt, who trails Gordon in the championship standing as well as the money-winning list, started calling the 23-year-old driver "Wonder Boy" earlier this year.
The feeling was that Earnhardt wasn't totally awestruck.


Business-Friendly New York
To the Editor:
"Building a Business-Friendly New York"  [ June 4 ]  paints a portrait of new Urban Development Corporation chief, Charles A. Gargano, as a man who would alter the mission of the U.D.C. to focus more on supporting private development than on promoting public projects.
While few would argue that what New York needs now is a healthier private economy, Mr.
Gargano should not lose sight of the long-term benefits of government investment in public and quasi-public projects.
The very projects toward which Mr.
Gargano has adopted a "go-slow" approach -- the waterfront park along the Hudson River, from Battery Park City to 59th Street; an international trade center and hotel in Harlem, and a light rail link-up between Manhattan and the airports -- are precisely what is needed to make Manhattan a more desirable place to live -- and to work.
Whatever short-term benefits the "Disneyfication" of Times Square and the "mallification" of Rockland County may bring -- in construction jobs now and service jobs later -- they do little to make New York a more vital and more pleasant place to live.

Along With A.L. West Competition, Rangers Also Face Heat Hurdle
The Chicago Cubs, one long-held theory goes, cannot win pennants because of the many day games they play in the hot summer months.
The Texas Rangers don't play many day games, but a similar theory holds that they can't win either because the heat and humidity they play in are even more oppressive than the Cubs face.
After spending a couple of days in the Arlington heat last week for the All-Star Game, baseball people who might not previously have experienced it gained a better understanding of the heat hurdle the Rangers have to overcome.

Send One Their Way


CRIME
"You know, my job, it's hard to sit in judgment about what people do," Inspector Charlie Resnick says in John Harvey's LIVING PROOF (Holt, $22.50).
"What happens, most of the time anyway, whatever it is someone's done, somehow you come to understand."
You won't find a more ethical or compassionate copper than Resnick, which is one reason this series, set in the depressed industrial city of Nottingham, represents the top of the line in the traditional British police procedural.
Another reason is that without deviating from the classic detective formula, Mr.
Harvey writes truthful stories about people who have to fight to retain their humanity in the harsh social climate of their gritty city.
In this context, crime is what happens when they fail.

Seriously, 'Love for Three Oranges' Can Be Funny
PROKOFIEV'S "LOVE FOR Three Oranges" is an exuberant and endearing little gem.
But considering how unseriously opera in general is taken these days, what chance is there that that most abusable of forms, an operatic comedy, might be taken seriously?
Sure enough, the new laser-disk "Love" from Pioneer Classics comes with a jacket disclaimer reassuring the prospective viewer that "the music is mostly trivial" ("a terrific five-finger exercise for the young Prokofiev") and that "this production achieves an almost greater seriousness by virtue of the wizardry of its production and refusal to take itself too seriously."


Abbreviating Daily Odyssey For Commuters
For years, commuters between Staten Island and midtown Manhattan have had to use cars, express buses and conventional ferries with subway connections.
Their routes are often circuitous: over bridges, through tunnels, across Brooklyn or even into New Jersey and back to Manhattan.
No matter how the trip is made, it takes at least 60 to 90 minutes during rush hour, often longer given routine glitches like construction, traffic accidents, congestion, inclement weather and subway disruptions.


The World: Withdrawal Symptoms; Honor, Too, Is Put to Flight in Bosnia
MANY things have died or been seriously compromised in Bosnia.
The optimism of the cold war's end.
The credibility of NATO.
The American commitment to European security.
The notion that a Europe no longer divided shares a commitment to basic human dignity.
But perhaps the death of Western honor has been the most devastating.
It was a sense of honor, conceived as part of a military culture that also embraced the values of self-sacrifice and unswerving courage, that drove American boys into Nazi fire and onto the Normandy beaches.
The same values were the guarantee and the bedrock of postwar security and prosperity in Western Europe.
Even in Vietnam, where America's confidence in itself was battered, the honor of fighting to extend the reach of freedom stood at the core of the beliefs of those who backed the war.

On the Roads: Trouble Spots Worth Missing
A look at trouble spots you may encounter in the next week -- or month, or months -- courtesy of Transcom, an interstate transportation agency.
1.
ROUTE 4 -- Fort Lee.
Eastbound left lane and ramp to northbound I-95 closed, through July.
One lane from upper and lowel level of George Washington Bridge to westbound Route 4 closed, through Nov. 15.


At 12, Shuttle's a Pumpkin?
A proposal to shorten operating hours on the Franklin Avenue Shuttle drew opposition last week from riders who wonder how a city that claims not to sleep could consider ending round-the-clock service on even one of its shortest lines.
The shuttle, which the Transit Authority has proposed closing from midnight to 6 A.M., is the only connection in Brooklyn between the IND A and C lines, which run through northern Brooklyn, and the BMT D and Q lines, which go to southern Brooklyn.
The next available connection is at the West Fourth Street station in Manhattan.
About 10,000 people ride the shuttle each day.


The Nation; Winning Friends On Social Issues
ON the so-called social issues, President Clinton's political advisers think he is well positioned on abortion.
Gun-control, too.
But they fretted that Republicans might be getting a leg up on two other issues, violence on television and prayer in the schools.
So with next year's election campaign just below the horizon, the President last week set some new coordinates for himself.


Rutgers Student Is Killed As Robbers Attack Car
Cindy Del Carmen Villalba came home Thursday after six weeks in Costa Rica, dropped her bags at her parents' apartment, gave her whole family souvenirs, and went for a drive with her best friend.
Within an hour Ms.
Villalba, a senior at Rutgers University, was dead.
The police said she was shot by three robbers as she and her friend sat talking in a parked car in Paterson, N.J.
Yesterday the police arrested three teen-agers and charged them with murder and robbery.


A Taste of the Water Gap, From 9 Painters
TO the hypothetical crow, this small town is but 30 miles from the Delaware River, and travelers heading west would do well to pause here.
The scenery is reason enough at any time, but right now it is getting a boost from an exhibition by nine painters, which is on view at Sussex County Community College.
Apart from anything else, "Delaware Water Gap Landscapes," as it is called, gives Water Gap-bound travelers a taste of things to come.
And well it might, for whether or not the artists live in the area (and most do), they are clearly partial to it.


John Weakland, an Originator of Family Therapy, Is Dead at 76
John F. Weakland, an innovative psychotherapist who helped originate the field of family therapy and created elegantly simple strategies for solving problems of human behavior at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif., died on July 8 at his home in Palo Alto.
He was 76.
His wife, Anna Wu, said the cause was Lou Gehrig's disease.


Charles Ives's In-Laws
To the Editor:
Regarding Russell Banks's essay on Mark Twain and the Rev.
Joseph Twich ell ("How a Clergyman From Hartford Freed Huckleberry Finn," June 18), Twichell had another important link with American culture and arts.
He was the father-in-law of Charles Ives, who married Twichell's daughter Harmony (yes, that was her name) in 1908.


July 9-15: Hiroshima Remembered; An Exhibition Shows What The Smithsonian Didn't
Remember the eviscerated Smithsonian Air and Space Museum exhibit on the Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima?
Many of the sorts of artifacts and images that were stripped away from that show are now on the walls of American University, in Washington.
The Smithsonian's plans for a major exhibit on the Enola Gay were radically altered last January by the institution's president, after months of criticism.
Veterans groups and members of Congress complained that the exhibition's text portrayed Americans as aggressors and Japanese as victims in the bombing.
Eventually, nearly all references to the bombing's effects on Japan were erased.
Historians were flabbergasted.
Although Washington University officials said their show was not an answer to the Smithsonian's show, the university's exhibit included artifacts like those planned for the Smithsonian.
There were various items on loan from Japanese museums -- a melted clock and lunchbox, disintegrated clothes and kitchen goods -- and graphic pictures of the bombing's victims.
Speaking at the new exhibit's opening ceremony, a bomb survivor described seeing a friend's face "peeled, hanging like pieces of rag." Another survivor said the dead bodies around Hiroshima "looked like charred fish."
Scholars on both sides of this debate have wondered if 50 years was long enough to heal the bombing's emotional scars.
Apparently not.

The Rev.
Canon John T. Morrow performed the ceremony at St.
Luke's Episcopal Church in Gladstone, N.J.

Her father retired as a portfolio manager at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company, the securities brokers in New York.


New Home for Museum Of Judaica in London
The Jewish Museum in London, closed since last July, has reopened at a new site near Camden Town Underground station.
Founded in 1932, the museum, which houses the British national collection of Judaica, now has three times the display space that it had at its previous location on Woburn Place in Euston.
The museum has three galleries.
The History Gallery traces the story of Jews in Britain from 1066 to recent times.
Among the exhibits are medieval notched wooden tax receipts, 18th-century portraits and an interactive map of Britain that shows the increase in Jews from 1290 to 1990.


No Headline
HE rode standing by the subway door, over 6 feet tall, and hanging to a strap on the No. 1 heading into the Bronx.
He looked young, strong, mean.
The dark look in his eyes, the sneer on his lips were unmistakable: blank hatred.
Contempt.
Was he a gang member? Or a freelance thug? Was he armed?


'Emblems of Mind'
To the Editor:
While I am grateful for the attentiveness with which Kendall L. Walton approached my book "Emblems of Mind: The Inner Life of Music and Mathematics" (June 18), there are several crucial assertions he makes that merit response.


Ideas &amp; Trends: The New Bipartisanship; Resolved: No More Bleeding Hearts
ALMOST every week in Washington these days, liberal advocacy groups like the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities publish analyses of Republican budget cuts that show they fall disproportionately upon the poor.
Almost every day, some lonely liberal stands in the House or Senate, or takes the microphone in a congressional committee, and warns that the restructuring of poverty programs dating back 30 or 60 years will lead, inexorably, to the suffering of children.


Economic Growth Leaves States In Best Shape Since Early 80's
An economy that has been growing for more than four years is finally shining on state governments, easing the way for nine of them to make significant cuts in taxes and allowing many to increase spending on popular programs like education and prisons, according to a survey published today.
For the first time in a decade, the National Conference of State Legislatures reports that states, on average, have reduced taxes by more than they raised them.
The survey did not examine whether some of these reductions simply represented shifts of programs to county and local governments.


Gonzalez's Role
To the Sports Editor:
Pancho Gonzalez had an effect beyond the world of sports ("Pancho Gonzalez, U.S. Tennis Champion, Dies at 67," The Times, July 5).


Entertaining the Devil in Connecticut
WITCHCRAFT is still alive in the United States," said John Putnam Demos. The statement sounds like a headline in a supermarket tabloid, and coming from Mr. Demos, a quiet-spoken and scholarly man in his late 50's, seems almost incredulous.
But he is serious and has credentials that make him an expert witness on witchcraft as it was in the 17th century, and as he sees it today, with parallels even including the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City.


Paradise Lost: America Refracted By a Foreign Prism
It's sad to look back at hope from the perspective of disenchantment, but as the American Century draws to a close, that prospect probably needs to be faced.
How did the hero turn into a villain in so many people's eyes?
How did a land that once signified the natural paradise fall into rusting disarray? a brilliant new show at the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal confronts the roots of our present discontent with such intelligence and depth that you end up feeling exhilarated instead of depressed.
"Scenes of the World to Come" is the first in a monumental five-part series that the center will present over the next three years.
Conceived by Phyllis Lambert, the center's director, the "American Century" series will examine different facets of architecture and urbanism.
Future exhibitions will look at the visionary urban schemes of Frank Lloyd Wright, Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape designs, Disney theme parks and suburban lawns.

Russia Refashioned
The Russian economy has come a long way in a short time.
Not quite four years since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russia has a market economy.
It is rough, inequitable and weak.
Many Russians, particularly the elderly trapped with fixed pensions from the Soviet era, have fallen into humiliating poverty.
The disparity in living standards, egregious but shielded under Communism, is now much worse and painfully visible to everyone.
The Government's role is still considerable.
But given the calcified state of the Soviet economy, and the crippling grip of the Kremlin's central planners, the transformation has been remarkable.

Movies This Week
LOOK for some golden movie moments on television this week.
In Richard Boleslawski's THEODORA GOES WILD (1936), Irene Bunne as a shy villager who has written a steamy best seller abruptly descends on her Manhattan publisher like a cyclone, complete with Russian wolfhound.
"Another thing," she hurls at the cowed staffers, "I want more publicity!" What an entrance!
The sedate Miss Dunne's official thaw in light comedy (opposite the game Melvyn Douglas) followed some "Show Boat" rakishness.
Then "The Awful Truth" with Cary Grant hit the jackpot.
For now, viva Theodora! -- Wednesday at 8 A.M. on Cinemax.
Early on in John Ford's great GRAPES OF WRATH (1940), with her family ready to head west, Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) sifts through mementos, like a World's Fair postcard to the plaintive "Red River Valley" on harmonica.
Dig the road-stop scene with the hungry Joad children eyeing a candy display.
It's straight out of John Steinbeck -- Monday at 10 P.M. and 2:10 A.M. on Amercian Movie Classics.
In a chuckly bit from Henry Koster's FLOWER DRUM SONG (1961), a young immigrant (Miyoski Umeki, in photograph) asks directions from a Chinese-American in San Francisco.
"Sorry, sister," she's told, "I don't speak Chinese." Miss Umeki is charming when she sings "I Am Going to Like It Here," from the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage score.
So is Nancy Kwan with "I Enjoy Being Girl." Sold -- Sunday at 10:30 P.M. on Disney.
A breathless moment from Fritz Lang's murky masterpiece, M (1931), shows a child-killer (Peter Lorre), flung before his captors and jury -- criminal Berlin.
Look at those faces -- Saturday at 9 P.M. on CUNY.
Through the swamp in Preston's Sturges's SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS (1941), a line of shuffling, shackled convicts (including Joel McCrea, as a misplaced Hollywood director) joins a poor, black congregation to watch a cartoon.
Minutes later, the church rocks with laughter -- Friday at 10 P.M. and 3 P.M. on American Movie Classics.

The World; Today's Drama: Twilight of the Nukes
FIFTY years ago today, physicists detonated a nuclear explosive they called The Gadget, rigged on a 100-foot steel tower in the desert near Alamogordo, N.M.
Since that first nuclear test, the United States has built 70,000 nuclear weapons of almost every conceivable kind: warheads, artillery shells, land mines, depth charges and even backpack-style plutonium explosives weighing 58 pounds but equivalent to 10 tons of TNT.
And then there were plain old bombs, those bulbous things with tailfins, designed to be dropped out of airplanes.
But now it is the twilight of the nukes.
They are being taken apart by the United States and the Soviet Union at the rate of 10 or 12 a day, and the new problem is how to keep track them of all.


Playalinda Beach Journal; With Nudity Law, Conservatives Draw a Line in the Sand
For decades, the boardwalk at the northern end of Playalinda Beach on the Canaveral National Seashore near here has been the de facto border for two types of sunbathers: those with swimsuits, and those without.
The two groups seemed to co-exist more or less peacefully until recently, when indignant conservatives persuaded the county to ban not only nudity but also "insufficient" beach attire.
Among the dumbfounded is Claude W. Miller, who after 16 years as the Sheriff of Brevard County is being asked to enforce a law that requires his deputies to distinguish, for example, legal attire from a "G-string" or "dental floss" bathing suit.
He said his deputies would worry only about full nudity and refer complaints about other states of undress to local prosecutors.
He also said he would test the legality of the ordinance in court by making two arrests, of a man and a woman, before making further arrests.


Those Consolation Prizes
To the Editor:
"You're Out! Clean Out Your Office! Now for Some Nice Parting Gifts" (June 11) astutely lists feelings of guilt and old ties of loyalty among the reasons for companies' largess in offering millions of dollars to separated executives.
A single parent with two young children and elderly parents, I, too, along with the mentioned 10,000 workers, have been thrown in the street by well-to-do firms for unstated reasons, and in one case was not even handed required notice or the typical two or four weeks' worth of pay.


Enter the Uninvited Summer Cuests, Sometimes Amiable, Always Hungry
THERE are several stone walls on the property, so sooner or later, it was bound to happen.
Chipmunks have moved in.
Perhaps it would be more accurate to say a chipmunk has moved in.
So far, it appears to be without a mate.
But this is not to be counted on; the chipmunk is, after all, a family type.
Although no nest has been discovered, this forager's hiding place has -- the downspout of a roof gutter.


They're Rebels Without a Cause, and Couldn't Care Less
SHOPLIFTING, TURNSTILE-JUMPING, potsmoking, pill-taking.
Trespassing, assault, rape, possibly murder.
Name a crime or misdemeanor, and if it doesn't involve guns, cars or syringes, teen-agers probably commit it during the day and night that are shown in Larry Clark's film "Kids," which opens on Friday.
They're not career criminals or hard-core gang members, just teen-agers hanging around in New York City, out to have some fun.
When they're not breaking laws, they're having extremely unsafe sex.
What makes Mr.
Clark's film so controversial is that for its teen-aged characters, nothing they do registers as a transgression or an outrage.
For them, it's just another day.


After 16 Days, a Rescue Stirs Hope in Korea
The hole was not much bigger than his head, and the stench of rotting flesh was beginning to fill the hot air this morning.
But An Gung Wook squeezed his way inside, inching forward into the pitch dark, scraping with his hands at the steel wires and porous cement, which fell away in flakes.
After digging for more than two weeks in the rubble of the collapsed Sampoong Department Store, Mr.
An, a rescue worker, was exhausted.
As the death toll rose today to 323 and hopes faded that any more survivors would emerge, Mr.
An wondered whether the sounds he thought he heard were real.
He called out for someone to respond to the beam from his light.


Rachel Jackson Christmas, Karlton L. Derrick
Rachel Jackson Christmas, the daughter of June and Walter Christmas of New York, was married yesterday to Karlton Lewis Derrick, the son of Elizabeth and Walter Derrick also of New York.
The Rev.
Dennis E. Norris performed the ceremony at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers.


Summertime Circus Grows More Civil
From his perch inside the newsstand at Sheridan Square, Kanu Brahmbhatt has an unobstructed view of Greenwich Village's busiest intersection, where five thoroughfares and a subway station meet in a tangle the locals call "the mousetrap."
"It's crazy out there," Mr.
Brahmbhatt, 42 and a native of India, says as tourists, revelers and neighborhood residents stream by his 10-by-14-foot corrugated metal shed.
"There's too much freedom in the Village," he says.
"It makes too many problems."

THE NEW JAZZ AGE
Just read Conroy's piece.
Disney couldn't have written it better -- obedient and reverential jazz musicians tramping through the woods, saxophones slung over their shoulders and singing "Whistle While You Work." I think I'm going to miss the jazz of the past, with its inconvenient sarcasm and self-mocking humor.

Even his caseworker, Milagro Echevarria, was afraid of Hsiao I. Chyi at first.
"But then I realized he's really a baby deep down inside," she said.
"His English isn't good. I think the family came from their country, and they just put him in regular schools, and no one helped him. It's sad to see him get down and cry when people don't understand him."

On the first tee was His Royal Highness, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, estranged husband of Fergie.
Driver in hand, he stood in front of the ancient clubhouse at the Old Course today, peering out across the widest fairway in championship golf.
Turning to his caddie, a wisely Scot with a thick burr, the Prince shot him a quizzical look.
"Well," he said, "where to?"


A Pro Gets a Second Chance to Run a Fund
RULE No. 1 for starting an investment fund: Don't do it the week the stock market crashes.
William F. Harnisch, the president of Forstmann-Leff Associates, a money management firm in New York, found himself in that unfortunate position eight years ago.
In October 1987, he went on the road trying to tap investors for a fund that would specialize in -- of all things -- market timing.
But the crash intervened, and the general public never got a chance to sample Mr.
Harnisch's investment expertise.

Sick Slot? Call Dr. Peterson
IT'S the middle of a hot, sunny Tuesday afternoon in Atlantic City.
The patrons of Harrah's are concentrating on the slot and video poker machines.
Nothing seems to distract them -- until one of the reels that is supposed to bring up the row of winning cherries stops spinning or the poker machine flashes "coin reversed" and seizes up.
That's when a gambler rushes to seek out a red-shirted casino employee, who fills out a pink slip of paper that ultimately brings Ron Peterson to the rescue.
At the age of 30, Mr.
Peterson has been answering these emergency calls for 10 years.
At least four repairmen are always on duty to fix the glitches that crop up in one or another of Harrah's 2,025 slot machines.


Kamienicki Returns, but Twins Aren't Impressed
This is certainly not going to quash any calls for another pitcher.
Scott Kamieniecki, on the disabled list since spraining his right elbow on May 5, could not pitch his way out of the fourth inning.
One night after the Yankee staff had allowed a season-high 17 hits for a nine-inning game, five pitchers surrendered 16 more to the lowly Minnesota Twins.
And, after scoring four runs in the first two innings, the Yankees managed just two measly base runners until a belated rally in the ninth.

Buying an Uneasy Home For New York City Waste
New York City has the people, the drains and the toilets -- more in a few blocks than in this entire West Texas county.
Hudspeth County has the land, 15 times as much as all of New York.
Which is why, when New Yorkers flush, their waste often ends up here, 2,065 miles away, in an isolated, impoverished county on the Mexican border whose largest town can't even afford a sewer system of its own.
Behind these simple facts lies a tale of political intrigue, legal maneuvering and big-city money, spent to persuade Texans to accept some 225 tons a day of what New Yorkers wouldn't.
For a Long Island company named Merco Joint Venture, the prize was a $168 million, six-year contract, beginning in 1992, to dispose of nearly a fifth of New York's sludge, the gunk left over after sewage has been treated.
Making virtuoso use of the legal means available, Merco took only 32 days to win a state approval that normally took months.


South Africa
To the Editor: We have recently returned from a six-week tour of South Africa.
My wife and I met scores of other visitors, but only a few Americans.
We were puzzled.
Americans are avid tourists.
Your own pages have amply described the feast awaiting the traveler there.
And, frankly, it felt good that our tourist dollars were helping people transfer power from an entrenched minority to a democratic majority, by and large through non-violent means.
If people are shying away because they think touring there is dangerous, they're making a big mistake.
A friendly, well-run, English-speaking country, it's far and away the best value for the money in Africa.


New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks
APOLLO 13 By Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger.
Pocket Books, $6.50.
The inspiration for the film of the same title, this book re-creates a harrowing journey in a spacecraft that almost became a tomb.
Jim Lovell commanded Apollo 13, which was headed for the moon in April 1970 when an oxygen tank exploded, forcing the crew and Mission Control to devise an escape route back to Earth.
Originally titled "Lost Moon," the book tells "the inside story" of a mission "widely remembered as NASA's finest moment," Rudy Abramson said here in January.
A WAY IN THE WORLD By V. S. Naipaul.
Vintage International, $13.
The making of empires -- national, personal and imaginary -- is the theme of this novel, which is a history of the creative spirit as well as a history of colonialism and its consequences.
Selected as one of the best books of 1994 by the editors of the Book Review, it features a narrator resembling Mr.
Naipaul.
Fiction is his means of exploration, much as the voyage was for the men of earlier centuries -- Columbus, Sir Walter Raleigh, Simon Bolivar and the Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco Miranda -- who also appear as characters.
Last year our reviewer, Brent Staples, called the novel "a distinguished book even by Naipaulian standards, a bewitching piece of work by a mind at the peak of its abilities."

Age-Mellowed Coffeehouses Of Budapest
IN Hungary, the devotion to coffee, like the passion for paprika, is a legacy of the Turks who occupied the country for 150 years.
None of Budapest's earliest coffeehouses still survives, but several that flourished in the late 19th century remain in business.
Holdovers from the golden age of the coffeehouse as literary salon, political forum and clubhouse, their often gloriously decorated interiors are protected by landmark status.
The indulgent excess of their confections appears safe, for the time being, from any contemporary notions of diet.
The demise of the Communist regime and the return of some of these venerable places to private ownership from government control is a turn of events that should please connoisseurs of good, strong coffee and delicious pastries.
With the exception of Angelika -- which went from state to church ownership about two years ago -- the best coffeehouses are the ones in private hands.
The fall of Communism also marked the end of several rather baleful decades for the cafe Lukacs.
Housed in an imposing building on a broad avenue, Lukacs served as the headquarters for the Nazi secret police and then the cafeteria for the Hungarian secret service.
It was reopened to the public in the 1960's and closed last year during a particularly convoluted effort at privatization, which may be resolved soon.


Hamilton Heights Pushing Amsterdam Avenue to Go Upscale
Amsterdam Avenue in the West 130's and 140's is lined with modest storefronts, many vacant.
The standard feature on most blocks is at least one cramped bodega, its products limited to soap powders, canned goods and other household staples that appeal to Hispanic shoppers in the predominantly Dominican neighborhood west of Amsterdam.
Shoppers from Hamilton Heights, the burgeoning black middle-class brownstone district to the east, say they find little enticement in the bodegas.
So they travel to other neighborhoods and to the Bronx for groceries and other goods.


From Welles's Mind: The Power of 'Caesar'
WHEN his compatriots, conspirators-to-be, shout "Hail, Caesar!" the command eerily echoes the sound of "Heil!" The curtain, the flag, the armbands, blood-red all, transmit the visual jolt of the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival's production of "Julius Caesar." It doesn't take a scholar to figure out that we're in Fascist country -- Rome it remains, presumably, though flashed forward from 45 B.C. to the 1930's -- and that somebody is telling us something.
The somebody was Orson Welles.
Already the revolutionary for all media, Welles, then 22 years old, was co-founder of the Mercury Theater in 1937 with John Houseman; he conceived of Shakespeare's tragedy as a 90-minute intermissionless reflection and portent of the decade's political upheaval.
Caesar was said to have resembled Mussolini, Welles played Brutus and all the players were described as wearing street clothes and modern uniforms.


Charting the Way to a Livelier Downtown
IN a perfect world, downtowns are bustling places, full of enticing shops, restaurants and theaters.
Alas, such has not been the case here in recent years, which is why the city retained Ferrandino &amp; Associates, planning and development consultants of Elmsford, to devise a comprehensive marketing and development plan to revitalize downtown.
In August 1994, the consultants started work on the project.
Eight months later, they filed the final report.

In Houston, Rebuilding by Creating
EARNESTINE W. COURTNEY, who is 87, has lived behind the row houses in Houston's Third Ward for 48 years.
She says the neighborhood was lovely when she moved in but declined about 15 years ago, thanks to "dope and prostitution and everything else." Men stripped down stolen cars there.
Boys kicked in her door.
Dead bodies turned up.
So Miss Courtney was pleased when volunteers for Project Row Houses swarmed over the area in 1994 to turn 8 of the 22 abandoned houses into permanent display spaces for black artists.
And she was riled to see boys throwing rocks at the newly repaired roofs.
Miss Courtney came out of her house packing a pistol.
End of rocks.

Last Wednesday's scene at the corner of Ditmars Boulevard and 31st Street had all the makings of a cheap detective novel.
But at this scene, the evidence was leaves instead of blood, and a stump instead of a body.

Surprising Victory by U.S. Wins Praise
To understand the significance of the astounding 3-0 victory by the United States over Argentina last night in the America Cup soccer tournament, one need only visit a playground in this isolated border town where schoolboys were already recreating the historic match this morning.
"No, I'm not going to play unless I get to be Eric Wynalda because he always gets the goals," said 11-year-old Oscar Diaz.
"O.K., but only if you let me be Kasey Keller because then I'll block all your shots, man," said his playmate, 12-year-old Felipe Berco.


Documents Show Clintons Got Vast Benefit From Their Partner in Whitewater Deal
From the moment questions about the Whitewater real estate venture began arising nearly three years ago, the main defense by President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, has been that they lost money on the ill-fated deal and were personally liable for its extensive bank loans.
But newly available documents -- including the first completed independent review of Whitewater, prepared for a Federal agency by a law firm -- cast both positions in a new light.

Streetscapes/Broome Street; When It Comes to Trucks, SoHo Is All Shook Up
DID you know that through trucks are not allowed on Broome Street, which at peak periods seems like their native habitat?
Some local activists do not like that awful, churning feeling of living in a cement mixer and claim that heavy trucking there is not only illegal but is shaking SoHo's historic buildings to bits.
They hope that special signs planned by the city's Department of Transportation will reduce traffic and save the facades.
Restoration professionals, however, say that trucks are not the source of the trouble.

Atlancic City; Buffet by DeMille
THE opening of a new casino buffet would not normally warrant much attention.
Every Atlantic City casino has some kind of all-you-can-eat restaurant, though prices, hours and menus vary (from $6.95 at the Claridge to $15.95 at Trump Plaza and the Grand).
Like many things in Atlantic City, the buffets may be best appreciated from a safe distance.
A typical casino buffet can move 300 slot players, walk-in tourists and families on a budget past the hissing steam tables every 20 minutes.
So jammed is the Beverly Hills Buffet at Merv Griffin's Resorts that reservations are required merely to stand in line.


Drunken Drivers in Jail Should Be Under Treatment
To the Editor:
You can make the punishment fit the crime with mandatory sentences for drunken drivers who kill, as suggested by State Senator Gordon A. MacInnes in the July 2 Soapbox essay "When the 'Good Citizen' Kills." But you can't throw away the key; so to deter future alcohol-related homicides, as well as critical spinal cord and head injuries, drunken drivers should experience intensive alcohol and drug treatment while they're inside.
Treatment is a lot cheaper than re-arrests and carnage on the highways.

Witness Tells Of Bag Sought In Bomb Case
A large duffel bag being sought by Federal agents in connection with the Oklahoma City bombing may contain a cache of explosives and gun parts, a witness in the case says.
That witness, James Rosencrans, said in an interview this week that his next-door neighbor, Michael Fortier, asked him to help bury a large camouflage bag in the scrub behind their trailer homes in this western Arizona town three days before the April 19 explosion.


The Day of the Long Shot
The art of handicapping took a hammering at Belmont Park yesterday when Abaginone, the even-money favorite from California, ran last in the field of eight while Shug McGaughey's Waldoboro, a 20-1 long shot, was winning the True North Handicap.
And Waldoboro scored by two lengths over an even longer shot, the 34-1 Corma Ray.
Abaginone, who arrived from California with his jockey, Gary Stevens, was never a factor.
Waldoboro flew from last place to seventh after half a mile, moved into contention in the homestretch and outran Corma Ray, Mining Burrah and Evil Bear.
The winner, a 4-year-old son of Lyphard owned by Emory Hamilton and ridden by Eddie Maple, raced the six furlongs in 1:093/5 and paid $42.60.

'Amorous Deceptions' at the Rushmore Festival
JUST as the misogynistic, anti-Semitic and otherwise not very nice August Strindberg was an indelible influence on modern drama, he was, by unfortunate consequence, the father of the ugly tell-all autobiography and talk show that is too much upon us.
Without the plays of Strindberg, notably "The Father," "Dance of Death" and "Miss Julie," where would O'Neill and Albee have found the nurturer of their demons?
The Swedish genius (1849-1912) -- by all accounts, a man close to madness -- poured his messed-up life into his plays, 52 of them, and other writings, 35 books, not to mention 15 volumes of letters.


Subway Work Stirs Lead Poisoning Fears
Paint chips flaking off the beams of an elevated subway line have raised concerns among parents and school officials who say children are at risk of lead poisoning.
Residents say renovation work on the M line, which started in 1993, has sent paint chips fluttering into the playground of Junior High School 93 , less than 20 feet from the elevated subway structure, and into neighboring backyards.
Transit Authority officials said the structure was last painted in the 1960's, when use of lead-based paint was prevalent.

But as curator of the show, Ms.

These are, respectively, that artists function "as the mythologizers of the environment and the world" and that women are "still not exhibited as often as men."

We paid $1,164 each for the round-trip tickets and six nights at a medium-priced hotel.


The Dow Is Near A Real Record
For the last 13 years, the most important investment trend has been the relative prices of financial assets -- stocks and bonds -- as opposed to real assets -- stuff ranging from cars to clothing to silver.
One easy way to monitor that is to look at what might be called the "real" Dow Jones industrial average -- the Dow adjusted for inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.
At its low point in 1982, the Dow was less than eight times as high as the price index.
A basket of stocks was worth 7.95 baskets of consumer goods.

Whitewater Revisited
Newly released documents related to the Whitewater affair cast the defense used by the President and Mrs.
Clinton in a new light.
Article, page 18.


CRIME: Giant Secret Drug Vault
Almost every day, at a different time, an unmarked van rolls up to a building in San Diego County, Calif., where boxes of drugs are unloaded, labeled, weighed and stocked on shelves.
It's the United States Customs Service's new 10,800-square-foot, supermarket-size drug vault, built a year ago with $1.4 million that came from sales of property seized in drug-related arrests.
And it houses about $1 billion of marijuana, heroin, cocaine and weapons taken mostly from cars at the Mexico-California border and occasionally from smugglers' airplanes intercepted by Customs Service jets and helicopters.
All of it is evidence for future trials.


Whitman's D.M.V. Folly A Homemade Mess
Most people come in direct contact with the state about twice a year -- when they pay their taxes, and when they visit a motor vehicle office to renew their license or auto registration.
Writing checks for the first of these is rarely an enjoyable event, and Governor Whitman's hastily conceived and sloppily executed effort to turn 23 state-run Division of Motor Vehicles branch offices over to private management firms has made a disaster of the other.
Late in the week, lines were still snaking out of doors and down streets at several of the branch offices, and people needing new licenses or registrations were still being turned away hours before closing time, four days after the Governor told reporters, on July 7, "We'll be fully staffed and everything will be fine come Monday."


ABOUT LONG ISLAND
DIANE ANTELL wanted to sit on her deck and gaze out at "moving water."
Because Mrs.
Antell and her husband, Gus, live several blocks from the ocean in East Hampton, that could have been a challenge.
But not in the Hamptons, the land of if you want it someone can create it -- for the right price.


July 9-15; Atoms Without Identities
Seventy years ago Albert Einstein was pondering a system of quantum statistics that had been worked out by the great Indian mathematician Satyendra Nath Bose to describe the behavior of things like atomic particles.
It occurred to Einstein that Bose might unknowingly have discovered a surprising possibility: the existence of a kind of super atom made up of merged ordinary atoms that had lost their individual identities.
If anyone but Einstein had come up with the idea it would have been consigned to obscurity, physicists agree.
But as it was, the notion of a "Bose-Einstein condensate," as the hypothetical stuff was named, remained alive, albeit on a back burner.


DIARY
STOCK OPTIONS The Low Four Figures
There are stock options and there are stock options; never has this been clearer.
You often hear of top executives getting them -- windfalls that would pay off the mortgages in entire neighborhoods, with enough left for a few centuries' worth of groceries.
But at Chemical Bank, some goodies trickled down to humbler workers last week, too; when the stock topped $50 for three days running, a share plan announced a year ago kicked in.
The numbers had considerably fewer decimal places than those in executive pay packages -- a profit of $1,481 (before taxes) -- but it did spark interest.
"It was amazing how suddenly the whole organization began paying attention to the stock price," said Chemical's chairman, Walter Shipley, who at yearend owned 551,950 shares and has options to buy 530,000 more.
TOBACCO  Yes, It's a Drug.
Now What?
The F.D.A. has this tricky problem.
It has decided that nicotine is an addictive drug, and one that's clearly dangerous; plug those facts into a legal computer and you'd have to ban cigarettes.
It can't do that, of course -- smokers would probably burn Washington to the ground (or bury it in ashes).
So last week the agency sent some more modest ideas to the White House (given the explosiveness of this issue, it passed the buck).
These included banning vending-machine sales, clamping down on sales to minors, and barring "Joe Camel"-type ads (which seem to have nearly vanished anyway).
Even such modest measures face a rough ride, though.
Tobacco is "a legal commodity" and should be treated as such, said one tobacco-state lawmaker, while another was "distressed" and "annoyed." . . .
Also last week, a glimpse into tobacco history: In 1950, an epidemiologist named Morton Levin wrote one of the first papers to show that smoking causes lung cancer, and campaigned against smoking throughout his career.
Dr.
Levin just died at 91.
SPENDING IT  Down and Out at Genentech
It's hard to get by on nearly $1 million a year.
So to make ends meet -- and considerable ends they must be -- G. Kirk Raab kept borrowing from Genentech, where he happened to be chief executive.
Finally, Mr.
Raab sought a $2 million personal-loan guarantee from Roche Holdings of Switzerland, even as he was negotiating the sale of his company to Roche -- a deal, by the way, that shareholders say shortchanged them.
This was too much for the board, which sent Mr.
Raab packing last week.
That ended a stormy tenure at this fast-growing company, one marked by strong criticism of its sales practices.
A top Genentech sales executive, in fact, is about to go on trial on charges of paying kickbacks to a pediatrician to prescribe Genentech's growth hormone.
INVESTIGATIONS  Blowing a Golden Whistle
It is not, generally, a great idea to bite the hand that feeds you -- especially if that hand belongs to a powerful company like Archer-Daniels-Midland.
That company has fed Mark Whitacre very nicely, in fact: as head of the BioProducts division, he is a rising company star.
But it's unclear whether that star will keep rising.
For last week it turned out that Mr.
Whitacre, working with the F.B.I., secretly taped executives' conversations as part of an inquiry into possible price-fixing.
Though whistleblowers have popped up in all sorts of places to denounce corporate naughtiness, it's highly unusual for such a high executive to play that role.
TRADE  No Favors From China
Yes, we can talk tough with China all we want -- on human rights, on Taiwan's status.
But highmindedness, no matter how virtuous, might also have its costs, for China's sheer bulk gives it indisputable power.
Last week, after saying that no decision was due for months, China snubbed Ford and Chrysler to give Mercedes a $1 billion contract to build mini-vans and engines in China, even though Mercedes has never actually built a true passenger mini-van -- you know, with all the cup-holders.
Chinese officials denied that rising tensions with Washington had anything to do with the decision, but Detroit has to be wondering.
DIPLOMACY  The Next Step in Vietnam
The building of a diplomatic bridge to Vietnam raised emotional issues -- some people saying the move was overdue, others insisting it wouldn't be time till all the missing were accounted for.
But put those issues aside for a moment: a big step in healing the wounds will come when goods can flow freely between the nations.
And despite last week's opening, that can't happen quite yet.
Still needed are a trade agreement and preferred trading status, and even then American companies must struggle to catch up with Asia and Europe to do business in a country with 73 million people, more than France or Britain.
AUTOS  Japan Meets One Trade Goal
Remember that hoopla-laden trade agreement with Japan last month, the one that made the world safe for Lexus owners?
No numbers.
No specific targets.
Just words.
But most people have probably forgotten that when George Bush went to Tokyo three years ago, Japan's auto industry set a target of buying $19 billion worth of American parts in the year that ended this past March, twice the previous level.
And guess what: Japan did so, and more.
Figures out last week showed $19.86 billion in purchases.
There's a footnote, though: that figure is total purchases, not imports.
Most parts were for Japanese plants here.
Japan had set a goal of $4 billion in imported parts, but fell short with just $3.23 billion.
CONSOLIDATION  One Bank, Indivisible
Something strange is going on.
One advantage of a national Government -- politics, if possible, aside -- would seem to be the economies of scale it offers in running things.
But everyone's been slamming the centralized bureaucracy as a failure.
Banking, though, is heading full-blast in the opposite direction.
Repeatedly citing "economies of scale," the nation's banks are tripping over themselves in a rush to merge into behemoths.
A few weeks ago, First Union said it would buy First Fidelity of Newark.
Then last week PNC agreed to buy Midlantic, and First Chicago and NBD agreed to merge into a Midwest powerhouse.
The value of the deals: $5.4 billion, $3 billion and $5.3 billion.
But there was no truth to rumors that Citibank was buying the Federal Reserve.

In the Region/Connecticut; Breaking Down Resistance to Low-Income Housing
IT is no secret that Fairfield -- the wealthiest county in one of the wealthiest states in the nation -- regards low-income housing as anathema.
Until recently most proposals for such housing were systematically and legally rejected under the area's predominant large-lot, single-family zoning.
Rejections still occur, but since the Affordable Housing Appeals Law was passed by the General Assembly in 1990 those decisions can be reversed.
Today, a relatively small but steady stream of attractive housing priced within reach of teachers, firefighters, police officers, older people on fixed incomes and low- to mid-level employees of the region's corporate community is being built, often with the help of the courts.

When produce is cooked within hours (or even minutes) of being picked, and a good fruity olive oil is on hand, you can get close to re-creating that Italian flavor -- if not the setting.

LOST AND FOUND: Loved Ones By the Car
Everyone knows Americans love their cars.
What's tantalizing is how much they love to pose by their cars.
In the snapshots here (from flea markets and friends' old albums), the automobile may be included to date the moment or to show how the people traveled, or how far they have come.
Most of the photos are mysteries: An early Thelma and Louise?
A mother and child after a visit to the grandparents?
But the photo at the top right gives a glimpse of the hidden stories that pull a viewer to lost family snaps.
It was taken in 1947 at a picnic near Portland, Ore., of two families 10 years after they fled Hitler.
And yet nothing about the photo suggests tragedy.
It reads only as an American moment, celebrating the pleasure of leisure, the freedom of the road and the power of a Pontiac sedan that could carry you anywhere.

In South Carolina, a Mother's Defense, and Life, Could Hinge on 2 Choices
Susan Smith does not appear to be insane in the layman's eye.
She sits quietly at the defense table between her two lawyers, flipping now and then through a small stack of letters from people writing to wish her well.
After eight months of inactivity in prison, she has gained weight and looks older than 23, almost dowdy, behind wire-rimmed glasses and plain, conservative suits.
Her face is almost serene, except when she turns around to flash a quick, thin smile to a relative in the courtroom, or when talk turns to her sons, and she cries briefly, discreetly.


July 9-15: Hiroshima Remembered; An Exhibition Shows What The Smithsonian Didn't
Remember the eviscerated Smithsonian Air and Space Museum exhibit on the Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima?
Many of the sorts of artifacts and images that were stripped away from that show are now on the walls of American University, in Washington.
The Smithsonian's plans for a major exhibit on the Enola Gay were radically altered last January by the institution's president, after months of criticism.
Veterans groups and members of Congress complained that the exhibition's text portrayed Americans as aggressors and Japanese as victims in the bombing.
Eventually, nearly all references to the bombing's effects on Japan were erased.
Historians were flabbergasted.
Although Washington University officials said their show was not an answer to the Smithsonian's show, the university's exhibit included artifacts like those planned for the Smithsonian.
There were various items on loan from Japanese museums -- a melted clock and lunchbox, disintegrated clothes and kitchen goods -- and graphic pictures of the bombing's victims.
Speaking at the new exhibit's opening ceremony, a bomb survivor described seeing a friend's face "peeled, hanging like pieces of rag." Another survivor said the dead bodies around Hiroshima "looked like charred fish."
Scholars on both sides of this debate have wondered if 50 years was long enough to heal the bombing's emotional scars.
Apparently not.

DOLE AND GRAMM CLASH ON REVISING LAWS ON WELFARE
Senators Bob Dole and Phil Gramm clashed pointedly today over welfare in a display of the Republican split that has stalled the legislation in a Senate increasingly roiled by Presidential politics.
In an address on the closing day of the Republican National Committee's summer meeting here, Senator Dole, the majority leader, threatened to keep the chamber in session all August if necessary to pass a welfare bill that would give states more control over their programs.
To the Senate, which treasures its summer break, that is a near-apocalyptic threat that can complicate the prospects of other bills as well.


Help for a Nature Trail Through the Meadowlands
A proposed 21-mile nature trail through the teeming marshes of the Hackensack Meadowlands got a big push last week, in the form of a $600,000 state grant to the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission.
The Meadows Path would run from Losen Slote Creek Park in Little Ferry down to West Hudson Park in Kearny, hugging the west bank of the Hackensack River much of the way.
It would connect a patchwork of existing trails, roads, sidewalks and utility and rail rights-of-way, some of which now run through private property and are off limits.
In addition to the wetlands that provide refuge for more than 200 species of birds, the trail will guide hikers through or past lowland forest, baseball fields, a large office park and even an abandoned landfill.


Metro-North Unions Continue To Talk Past Strike Deadline
A strike deadline came and went early this morning as officials of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad and 17 of its unions continued marathon contract negotiations, with both sides still far apart on several issues.
A strike had been scheduled to begin after the union's 12:01 A.M. deadline, but both sides agreed with a Federal mediator to continue talking, although no settlement was assured.
The negotiations were apparently snagged over Metro-North's demands for a variety of work rule changes that would give it greater flexibility in scheduling night and weekend work, using part-time employees and contracting out some railroad operations.

Gooden Is Benched Again
WHO'S an all-around nice guy off the field?
Apparently not Dwight Gooden, the former pitching whiz of the New York Mets, whose latest woe is that he has lost the larger-than-life place in Manhattan that he held for the last decade: a 42-foot-wide-by-95-foot-high outdoor mural for Nike.
The mural is at 351 West 42d Street on the side of the Holland Hotel, which, like the 30-year-old Mr.
Gooden, has fallen on hard times.
Charles Oakley, 31, the power forward for the New York Knicks and "an all-around nice guy off the court," as the Nike mural now states, is up in Mr.
Gooden's place, but this has nothing to do with Mr.
Gooden's troubles with cocaine and the law, or whether he is a nice guy, Nike says.

In South Carolina, a Mother's Defense, and Life, Could Hinge on 2 Choices
Susan Smith does not appear to be insane in the layman's eye.
She sits quietly at the defense table between her two lawyers, flipping now and then through a small stack of letters from people writing to wish her well.
After eight months of inactivity in prison, she has gained weight and looks older than 23, almost dowdy, behind wire-rimmed glasses and plain, conservative suits.
Her face is almost serene, except when she turns around to flash a quick, thin smile to a relative in the courtroom, or when talk turns to her sons, and she cries briefly, discreetly.


Newspaper Executives Gird for War of (Last Two) Tabloids
For years, the experts have held that financial troubles at New York City's tabloids were the market's way of saying that New York could not be a four-newspaper town.
The market finally spoke, with a vengeance, when an executive flew in from Los Angeles last week and, after 10 years of losses, closed New York Newsday in an instant.


Welfare Program Helps Many Climb the Ladder
THIRTY-NINE-YEAR-OLD Frances S., the mother of two, was dependent on public assistance for years.
In addition to battling a drug and alcohol problem, she became homeless after an abusive marriage and lived in a shelter with her children.
Now Frances, a Briarcliff Manor resident whose full name is being withheld to avoid embarrassing her family, is off welfare and working 20 hours a week with autistic children as a behavioral therapist.
She credits a model program with helping her turn her life around.


Key to Buying an Old House: A New Inspection
THERE are two kinds of people who buy old houses: old-house people -- who generally know what to expect -- and regular house people, who stumbled into the perfect setting or the best bargain or the most mellow and lovely old manse and had to have it.
"Oh, yeah, there can be more wrong with old houses than with new houses," said Skip Broom, a house restorer and builder from Hadlyme, Conn., who also does pre-purchase house inspections for $250 to $350.
"But you have to realize how incredibly strong these old places are.

Hong Kong Aquarium Is Back in the Swim
Visitors to Ocean Park, a Hong Kong amusement park with a water theme, can explore the expanded Atoll Reef aquarium, with 3.8 million gallons of water and some 7,000 fish.
More than 400 species native to the Phillipines, Singapore, Vietnam, Australia, the Maldives and the Red Sea are displayed.
The Atoll Reef reopened in the spring; it had been closed since October 1992 for a $7.7 million refurbishment program.
Ocean Park is on Hong Kong island, between Aberdeen and Repulse Bay.
Entrance to the Atoll Reef is included in admission to the amusement park, which is about $17, $8 for children 12 and under.

How About Opponents Of Bilingual Education?
When I first read "Classes Where Students' Languages Are as Varied as the Subjects"  [ June 25 ]  I was quite upset because it seems to make every attempt to present the views, thoughts and quotations of bilingual-education supporters, but fails to present the ideas and viewpoints of those who oppose it.
As a part-time staff member to Congressman Peter King, Republican of Seaford, whose bill the National Language Act would not only make English the official language, but would also eliminate funding for the Federal Office of Bilingual Education, I know that this opposition is significant and really should not be trivialized.
After all, the importance of an understanding of English is proven simply by a glimpse at the Help Wanted section that shows there are not many job opportunities for people who do not speak it.
However, after rereading the article, my thoughts shifted beyond the fact that my boss's ideas were being ignored and focused instead on the fact that by offering such a one-sided piece of journalism, your publication is doing your institution and the American people a great disservice.
In an era when many people turn to the medias as their only source of news, bias in reporting serves to disenfranchise people further from the system than the subjects that you primarily write about.


The First in the Velvet Glove
Vaclav Klaus, the imperious conservative economist who is Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, is on stage in the cultural hall of Sokolov, a coal-mining town where the pollution is so bad the air tastes of grit.
He is explaining to an admiring audience how all is well in the land.
Unemployment, at 3.3 percent, is the lowest in Europe.
Inflation is 10 percent, one of the most moderate rates in the former Eastern bloc.
And the country has a healthy budget surplus of $400 million, the only Central European nation in this enviable position.
The sole dissonant note during the smoothly orchestrated performance comes from some students in the balcony holding up a white banner to protest proposed nationwide fees for university education, and the combative Klaus rises to the provocation.
"Why should anyone in this room pay for the investment in somebody else's future?" asks the Prime Minister, cutting the air with a few karate chops and staring down his young critics.
The audience, mostly middle-aged and elderly, likes the jousting and erupts in applause.

The Nation; Idle Hands Within the Devil's Own Playground
INSIDE a metal factory on Industrial Boulevard in the small Texas city of Lockhart, an ambitious social experiment is proceeding quietly.

July 9-15: Political Prisoners; Myanmar's Dissident Leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Is Freed at Last
When Nelson Mandela was released from prison, the title of world's most famous political prisoner fell to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the dissident leader in Myanmar, the nation once called Burma.
But now, happily, she has lost the title, too.
After having been detained for nearly six years, she was freed from house arrest last week by the army generals who run the country.


It's Vegetable-Transplant Time
Transplant broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower seedlings into the garden for a fall crop.
If you didn't start any from seed, check local nurseries, or ask vegetable-gardening friends for extras.
These crops usually do better in the fall because they escape both bugs and heat.
Take softwood cuttings of shrubs like butterfly bush, weigela, honeysuckle, mock orange, privet and roses.
Cut just above a leaf node, trim back to three sets of leaves, dip the stem in water, dip it in rooting hormone powder and insert in potting soil, with two nodes beneath the soil.
Label the plants, including the date.
Place pots in a homemade propagation tent made of plastic bags.
Keep the soil moist.
Cuttings will take one to two months to root.


Tussaud's and Movie Chain Join Disney in 42d Street Project
Clearing the way for the redevelopment of 42d Street, Madame Tussaud's, the famous London wax museum, and AMC Entertainment, a movie theater chain, have reached agreements to open new attractions in the city's old theater district, people involved in the transactions say.
The agreements appeared to fulfill a requirement set by the Walt Disney Company, which has a tentative contract to rehabilitate the New Amsterdam Theater but threatened to pull out unless the city met yesterday's deadline to attract two more entertainment companies to invest in cleaning up the seedy block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.


Oasis
PEOPLE HAVE THEIR OWN WAYS OF USING CENTRAL PARK.
SUMMERS it's for lovers, patzers, dreamers, cruisers, anglers, birders, foragers and practitioners of t'ai chi.
Anything can happen.
Here's proof: Once, playing with my friends near the 86th Street transverse, I looked up and saw a large brown handbag swinging from a tree.
The reward was big enough for lunch at Schrafft's and a movie.
In the monkey house at the old zoo, Caroline the gorilla spat at my grandmother and hit her in the face. (Caroline's cagemate was Jo Ann, the same name as my older sister.) The park is where, when my mother was 5, she buried Dickie, her pet canary, in a corn flakes box.
Once, when there was a restaurant at Bethesda Fountain, I saw a man order an "arty-choky." He ate the whole thing, even the fur, with a knife and fork.
Other, more amazing summer encounters: Egrets that look as if they're posing for Audubon, Madonna, Bill Clinton and almost every old boyfriend I ever had.
Central Park is where you want to be in love, or feel more in love if you already are.
It's where you must, must be kissed.
For years growing up, I thought the bridle path was where you went to get married.
Eau de coconut oil, dental floss bikinis, Bruce Davidson (who's been taking pictures in the park for four years), four kinds of music in Ivesian overlap on a Kelly green beach, the miracle when you're little of discovering mica in Manhattan schist and lying on your back in the sun in the exact same place you steered your sled that winter.
It's democracy in action.
There's no palm to grease for a honey hole at the Harlem Meer.
Central Park is an oasis in a steel-and-granite Sahara, the center of the city that's the center of the universe.
Once, when my son was sick, I opened his window and the sound of Simon and Garfunkel wafted in.
Svengalisized, we got our bikes and went out into the night.
The park was a party.
Peter breathed cool air.
By the time we got home, he was cured.
Central Park is my gym, my Walden Pond, my $5 tennis club.
Walking around the reservoir, I can't tell if what I'm hearing is a siren or a loon.
We take from the park what we need.
There's enough to go around -- 843 acres and it's all ours.

Apply Ice
Here is Ma, doing a flea market in Woodstock, when Death strolls over to her booth.
A bee sting, actually.
Ma doesn't know she is allergic, but she finds out fast: her blood pressure drops, her vision blurs; Ma knows if somebody doesn't do something, she's finished.
It is a dire moment, but for the time being, let us leave Ma, collapsed near her folding table and somewhat cyanotic, and talk about her fashion sense: elastic waists.
And as for casual wear -- that is, for doing flea markets -- the T-shirts they give college kids on spring break at Daytona Beach.
Ma sneaks into line to get them because they are her favorite price: free.
She does like a nice piece of jewelry, though, and when she hits the ground in Woodstock she is wearing, on her left hand, a platinum ring encircled with diamonds.
Which she raises feebly.


POSTINGS: A Landmark and Dining Map; Strolls and Snacks In Jackson Heights
A new glossy foldout map and guide, "Historic Jackson Heights Visitors Guide," is available for the cost of two 32-cent stamps from the Jackson Heights Beautification Group in Queens, which compiled it.
Its maps, list of 28 restaurants and 20 historical and cultural sites go beyond the borders of the 1920's garden community into Flushing and Long Island City.
Still, the focal point is Jackson Heights, bordered by Junction Boulevard on the the east, Roosevelt Avenue on the south, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway on the west and LaGuardia Airport to the north, and its 30-square-block historic district, landmarked in 1994.
"We're hoping to appeal to people interested in ethnic foods," said Daniel C. Karatzas, a director of the group.
"We have Argentinian, Italian, Indian, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Colombian, Peruvian, Uruguayan restaurants. We're hoping to get people interested in neighborhoods and historic preservation."


Dutch Settlers Start Boom in Texas Dairy Farms
It is near midnight on Friday at the Cutting Horse saloon, and only nine boisterous young men remain.

I came here expecting not much from the ballyhooed project and found myself swept up in it.
"It" means the whole giddy affair -- the revelers who turned the bleak fields around the Reichstag into Woodstock East, the art students who gathered to sketch the building, the street vendors, the posturing politicos, the store windows around Berlin suddenly filled with wrapped objects, and the billboards that used the project to hawk beer and cigarettes.


Connecticut Q&amp;A: Michael W. Kozlowski; Pushing Cars Toward the Bar Code Era
IN MARCH, Michael W. Kozlowski, of Granby, was appointed Commissioner of the state's Department of Motor Vehicles, an agency that has a $73.2 million budget, 925 employees and 2.4 million customers -- licensed drivers and vehicle owners.
Mr.
Kozlowski, 42, joined the agency in 1987 and as deputy commissioner from February 1991 to December 1993, he stressed customer service as a way to ease the impact of closing eight of the department's 19 branches.
He was involved with implementation of programs like the roving photo-licensing buses and lease-free satellite offices in shopping malls and town halls.


From Wall St. Guru to Mutual-Fund Empire Builder
WHEN Mario J. Gabelli was a freshman at Fordham University in the early 1960's, he had already developed a precocious interest in the stock market, poring over The Wall Street Journal and buying shares in companies like ITT.
But what old friends really remember from those college years were Mr.
Gabelli's business ventures -- the airline catering business, the student trips to Bermuda, the flashlights he sold from the trunk of his car during electrical brownouts.
Three decades later, the 53-year-old Mr.
Gabelli has become one of Wall Street's most respected stock pickers, with a stellar record of managing money for big institutions and, through mutual funds, individual investors.
As befits a Wall Street guru, he appears often in investment magazines and on television, with his shock of silver hair and his mastery of bons mots -- usually with exclamation points at the end.

Park's Boosters Fight Nursing Home Plan
POOR Untermyer Park.
Ever since Samuel Untermyer died in 1940, his Beaux Arts estate on North Broadway here has been buffeted by natural and social forces worthy of King Lear.
Untermyer, a millionaire lawyer and botanist, tried to give the property away during his lifetime, but no one wanted it.
He left it to New York State in his will, but because an endowment was not part of the package, the state declined it.
So did Westchester County and the City of Yonkers.
After six years of legal wrangling, the city finally accepted part of the estate as a park, but by then a cycle of decay, which still plagues the property, had begun.

A Wobbly Kirov Is Saved by 'The Firebird'
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A HIStorical determinist to suggest that arts institutions, like artists, mirror the society around them.
To say that the Kirov Ballet from Russia was a company in disarray on its recent visit to New York would be untrue.
But like the country in which it exists, the Kirov is very much a company in transition.
The certainties and standards, both artistic and technical, that defined the troupe in the past are now less obvious.

'Made in Italy' Taste Starts With Fresh Vegetables
WHEN friends return from vacations in Italy, they invariably complain that the food simply doesn't taste the same here.
A plate of spaghetti with tomatoes and basil that tasted sublime in Positano or Siena is ordinary when made at home.
But now fresh, locally grown vegetables are coming into season.
When produce is cooked within hours (or even minutes) of being picked, and a good fruity olive oil is on hand, you can get close to re-creating that Italian flavor -- if not the setting.


Bolivia's Chief Struggles to Fulfill Promise to Indians
By way of explaining his promise to shift political and economic power to Bolivia's majority Indian population, President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada says his reformist zeal probably stems from feeling like an outsider in the United States as the child of an exiled Bolivian diplomat.

Sanchez de Lozada said in an interview.

Rights Of Aged Tenants
EARLIER this year, an 89-year old New York City woman was given a second opportunity to purchase the one-bedroom apartment she has lived in for 34 years.
She had declined the first offer several years ago when the building was originally converted to a co-op and remained a tenant of the co-op sponsor.
She has since declined the second offer, too, but this time her apartment was sold to an investor.
Family members now fear the new owner will evict her when the lease expires.


Stock Cars, Adrenaline and Hustle
TAKE a deep breath.
Smell that hot, heady reek of gasoline, burning brakes and sizzling rubber?
Smell that fried chicken spattering and crackling at the food stand?
That's what stock car racing smells like, what Flemington Fair Speedway smells like on a muggy Saturday night.
"It's amazing, isn't it?" says the Rev.
Dan Schafer, the track's chaplain and a freelance racing photographer.
"Once that racing smell gets in your system, you just can't get it out."


Bit by Bit, a Dreary Landmark Comes Down
A local landmark is being demolished in Journal Square, but no one is complaining.
It is the old Hudson County Jail, a fortresslike seven-story monument to ugliness and despair.
The yellow-brick structure, build in 1926 and vacant since the completion of a much larger jail in Kearny in 1991, will make way for a parking lot.


Stone Chambers Silent on Their Makers
ON a hillside a mile from the nearest paved road, surrounded by a latticework of stone walls, about 10 feet high and 15 feet wide, far wider and higher than needed to contain any cow that ever lived, the stone chambers looked like ancient temples.
"The shaman goes into the chamber and gets charged up," Martin Brech theorized, standing atop the huge wall.
"The rest of the tribe stands here and watches the sun come up."


Saberhagen's Injury Puts Rotation in Doubt
The Mets' two-game winning streak came to a halt last night with a 5-4 loss to the Colorado Rockies at Shea Stadium.
Another defeat?
The Mets can handle that.
After 45 of them you get used to it.
What the Mets might not be able to handle is the potential loss of the ace pitcher Bret Saberhagen, who left the game in the third inning with a strained muscle just below his rib cage on his left side.


Park's New Battlefield Is Grill
Prospect Park's battle of the band shell is not a competition of local talent, and its barbecue fight is nothing like a cook-off.
They are disputes over how the park should balance active recreation and quiet repose.
Residents of Prospect Park West, once called Brooklyn's Gold Coast for its stately homes, have complained for years that the popular concerts in the park's Ninth Street band shell are too loud.
Now they are worried that barbecuers are charring the park's lawns, scarring trees and leaving litter in their wake.


Oil Industry Doesn't Need A Holiday on Royalties
To the Editor:
Congress will soon determine whether to give away potentially billions of dollars in royalties from oil and gas development on Federal lands in the Gulf of Mexico.

NATO Bombing and Serb Hostage-Taking Now Mark Turning Point in War
As the Western allies ponder how to respond to the latest crisis in the Balkans, they face a fundamental question: Are they willing to risk war over Bosnia?

Fortune's Smiles: The Lotto Girls
If you don't play the New York State Lottery games, the faces may register only as blips on your consciousness during the 11 o'clock news, popping up somewhere between the latest murder spree and the baby gorillas born at the zoo.
But if you are among the millions of people who make New York's the state lottery with the largest revenue (sales last year of $3 billion, with 41 percent of the profits going toward the state's education budget), you know the Lotto girls.
For about two minutes a day, every day but Christmas, the current lineup -- Kimberly Chapman, Annette Collins, Maxine Gibbs, Stephanie Moore, Judith Ortiz and Yolanda Vega -- is squeezing maximum interest out of the line: "And the next number up is . . . "
During most of the 1980's, winning numbers were announced nightly by Bob Brown, a New York City radio personality.
But in 1988 lottery officials decided that the announcements could use a little glitz.
And so, the Lotto girls, as they became known, were born.

The Nation: Nicotine Fit; No Prescription Necessary
IF the Government determines that cigarettes must be regulated as a drug, the Food and Drug Administration will be thrust into a rather odd role: monitoring the marketing of a substance whose chief side effect is death for about one in three of the people who use it.
The agency's mission is usually to prevent substances with severe side effects from being sold at all, except in special cases, as with chemotherapy drugs for cancer.
But while it proposed last week that nicotine in tobacco products be declared a drug subject to F.D.A. jurisdiction, the agency is suggesting a regulatory strategy that is altogether different.
If the White House approves the F.D.A.'s proposal, cigarettes would become subject to some regulations but not to others.

Word for Word / Papal Letter; To the Women of the World: An Affirmation of 'Feminine Genius'
IT is a rare day that Pope John Paul II strikes a chord that echoes fairly well with Roman Catholic feminists.
Only about a year ago he infuriated many church liberals by telling the faithful to abandon any thought of women becoming priests.
But last week, the Pope issued a letter to women that was notable not just for its clarity but also for a personal apology for those in the church who had contributed to the oppression of women.

Japanese looking for a way to misbehave and not get caught by wives or other concerned parties have solved their problem in typical Japanese fashion, with technology.

The incident also cast light on a bitter feud between the people serving the food, the Long Island-based Hope for the Future Ministry, and the street's block association over use of La Plaza Cultural, an empty lot on the corner that has long been a hangout for anarchists and drug users.


More Bookstore Casualties
After decades as a favorite haunt of book lovers on the Upper East Side, the Burlington Book Shop on Madison Avenue near 81st Street closed recently for the last time.
Just last week, Endicott Booksellers, a fixture on Columbus Avenue near 81st Street for 14 years, announced its own going-out-of-business sale.
The two shops have something besides their demise in common.
In the last few years, each got a new neighbor, a Barnes &amp; Noble superstore.


War on Rebel Kurds Puts Turkey's Ideals to Test
When Turkish soldiers came to his village last year, they gave Mehmet, a 15-year-old Kurd, and his neighbors a choice: join the Turkish Government in defending the village against Kurdish separatists or leave.
It was really no choice at all.
A few men earlier agreed to become "village guards," armed and paid by the Government.
But they suffered reprisals from the Kurdish Workers Party, a Marxist group whose 11-year-old insurgency in this barren southeastern region has put Turkey's democratic credentials to the test.


CAUSES: Connecting Continents
Here's an idea: Build a tunnel under the Bering Strait.
And here's the newsletter that promotes the idea: The Tunnel Times: The Journal of the Interhemispheric Bering Strait Tunnel &amp; Railroad Group.
The tunnel's advocates want to establish a freight connection, built by private enterprise, across the Northern Hemisphere.
The more than 60-mile tunnel would link Wales, Alaska, and Uelen, Russia, and would require 2,500 miles of new rail on either side to make a fully functioning freight railroad.
A cost of $40 billion would be on the low side.


Corrections
The Streetscapes column on July 2, about the former Spear &amp; Company building at 22 West 34th Street, referred incorrectly to the group whose complaint caused a large advertising mural on the front of the building to be painted over.
It was the 34th Street Partnership that brought the complaint, not the 34th Street Midtown Chamber of Commerce.


Just When Things Were Going so Badly, Success
ON THE WALL OF HIS STUDY, the director and screenwriter Tom DiCillo has hung an ink drawing on white legal paper depicting God as a big-headed, unshaven giant.
His bulging eyes are glued to a baseball-sized version of the world, which he is holding in the palm of his hairy hand.
The drawing is labeled "the film."
It is a DiCillo original, fabricated during post-production of "Living in Oblivion," his second feature film, which opened on Friday.


Mallon in Poor Health But Excellent Position
The stiff gale off the mountain today was Meg Mallon.
While most of her peers got lost in Broadmoor's tall weeds and monstrous greens, Mallon shot a course-record 66, grabbed a two-stroke lead after the third round of the United States Women's Open and stocked up on cold medicine.
Her breathing is erratic, her cough is incessant and her nightly hours of sleep can be counted on one hand, but the Open would be in gridlock without her.
Mallon's 54-hole total of five-under-par 205 is an Open record.


Winning Reprieves for Historic New Jersey
A decade ago, dozens of New Jersey's historic sites had become so dilapidated that they were shuttered and forgotten.
While a few major attractions continued to thrive, smaller ones either struggled to remain open or closed indefinitely.
In the cities, elaborately designed buildings that once evoked civic pride stood crumbling and vacant.
By 1987, the State Legislature realized the extent of the decay and took action: it established the Historic Preservation Bond Program, New Jersey's first fund for preservation.
Since then, voters have approved two bond acts allocating $50 million in state bonds to restore historic sites.
Last week, the New Jersey Historic Trust, which oversees the program, awarded the latest installment of that money -- $10 million -- to 36 sites around the state.


What's Their Problem?
"THESE KIDS, THEY CAN'T ALL BE bad, can they?" asks Glenn Ford in the person of a nervous high school teacher in the 1955 film "Blackboard Jungle." (This is before they've tried to rape one teacher and broken the treasured jazz-record collection of another.) Oh yes, they can.
For at least 40 years, Hollywood has shown just how distrubed, destructive and even depraved the younger generation has become.
Five landmark films about troubled youths reveal that some things have changed and others have not.

A Trove of Memories In Photo Albums
After reading "About Long Island: Making a Day of Fantasy for the Bridge and Groom: Just One More"  [ June 18 ]  I ran into my den to find old photo albums.
Fred Marcus, Andy's father, had recorded most of our family events.
He had captured memories of my children, their graduations, their weddings and our anniversaries.
A well-chosen photograph tells it all, and an unposed picture tells the truth.
Nothing else has to be said.


Enter the Uninvited Summer Guests, Sometimes Amiable, Always Hungry
THERE are several stone walls on the property, so sooner or later, it was bound to happen.
Chipmunks have moved in.
Perhaps it would be more accurate to say a chipmunk has moved in.
So far, it appears to be without a mate.
But this is not to be counted on; the chipmunk is, after all, a family type.
Although no nest has been discovered, this forager's hiding place has -- the downspout of a roof gutter.

I always marveled that our sole native art form was also the best expression of democracy we had.

Not Much Old Remains Of 3d Oldest Building
To the Editor:
By calling the quondam Joseph Rose House at 273 Water Street "the third oldest building in Manhattan" ("Where Dogs Fought Rats, and Fallen Women Gathered," June 25) you are perpetuating a myth.
Articles in your newspaper in 1989 and 1993 made the same inappropriate claim.


Where to Clamor
To the Editor:
In his essay on "Beauty in the Form, and Even in the Face"  [ July 2 ]  Bill Irwin mentions that Kino on Video has not released Buster Keaton's 1928 classic "The Cameraman." Mr.
Irwin suggests that "if enough of us clamor, maybe Kino will give us more."


Gondoliers Threaten To Make Things Hum
Visitors to Venice briefly heard the hum of an outboard motor coming from a gondola last month, a sound that could resume in the future if the city does not enforce speed limits on the canals.
Gondoliers have threatened to motorize some of their gondolas in an effort to force city officials to reduce the increasingly heavy swells caused by the motorboats that clog the waterways.
Last month the gondoliers made a trial run launching an oarless gondola, fitted with a small motor, which went up the Grand Canal and was then placed in storage.

New York City's Recovering Fiscal Health
To the Editor:
Re "The Bond Rating Can't Be Ignored" (Op-Ed, July 12): Ester R. Fuchs, former Mayor David N. Dinkins's campaign adviser, is wrong to assert that Standard &amp; Poor's decision to downgrade New York City's bond rating has significant monetary implications.
The market has taken into account a BBB+ rating for city bonds since 1991, when Moody's downgraded the city in the prior administration.


Whitewater Subject in Plea
The Whitewater independent counsel has announced a plea agreement with a business associate of James B. McDougal, who was Bill Clinton's partner in the Whitewater real estate venture.
The plea agreement, disclosed on Thursday in Federal court proceedings in Little Rock, Ark., is a further step by the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, toward building a case against Mr.
McDougal himself.
It involves Larry E. Kuca, who headed Madison Financial, an important subsidiary of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, the savings association that Mr.
McDougal owned and ran during the 1980's.

Department Of Education Spared, Again
The Department of Education, which has come under intense fire in recent weeks from Congressional conservatives who want to dismantle it, has survived for another year, though the reprieve apparently exacted a price.
The House majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, who scorns the department as an example of "trickle-down incompetence," acknowledged last week that he could not muster the votes this session to pass either of two bills to abolish the department.

Options in Case of a Train Strike
NEGOTIATIONS between Metro-North workers and management continued last week as the Westchester Weekly went to press, and there remained a chance that commuters would wake up tomorrow morning to face a railroad strike.
If that is the case, they will have some options.
Metro-North assembled a range of back-up services to get commuters into and out of city, but officials emphasized that no series of alternatives would smoothly accommodate the more than 90,000 customers who travel to Manhattan by train each weekday.
Expect crowds and delays, they said.

Suzanne H. Emam, the daughter of Dorothy Emam of Riverdale, the Bronx, was married yesterday to Gabriel J. Chin, the son of Frank Chin of Los Angeles and Suzanne Abrams of Syracuse.

She graduated from the State University at Binghamton, N.Y., and received her master's degree in social work from Columbia University.
Her mother is an administrative assistant at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.


THAT MADE-in-ITALY TASTE STARTS WITH VEGETABLES
WHEN friends return from vacations in Italy, they invariably complain that the food simply doesn't taste the same here.
A plate of spaghetti with tomatoes and basil that tasted sublime in Positano or Siena is ordinary when made at home.
But now fresh, locally grown vegetables are coming into season.
When produce is cooked within hours (or even minutes) of being picked, and a good fruity olive oil is on hand, you can get close to re-creating that Italian flavor -- if not the setting.


Call It a Pre-Vacation Camping Trip
Around midnight last Tuesday, about 50 people prepared to spend the night on the sidewalk in front of 630 Fifth Avenue, at Rockefeller Center.
The seven-foot-wide area usually set aside for them near the curb was carpeted with sleeping bags, newspapers, plastic trash bags and a few lawn chairs and coolers.
"Everybody's walking by and asking, 'What are you protesting?' or 'Are you praying?' " said Maria Mateiro, of Newark, as she pointed across the street to St.
Patrick's Cathedral.
"Yeah, we're praying we get our passports."

The House: Battlefield of Short-Tempered Partisanship
Simmering with short-tempered partisanship, the House of Representatives has become a battlefield where Democratic obstructionism confronts Republican cockiness.
The main casualty seems to be the timeliness and legislative efficiency that once marked the new Congress.
Last week, Democrats forced the House to hold 16 procedural roll-call votes, on such matters as "tabling the motion to reconsider the motion to order the previous question," or "that the committee rise and report the bill back to the House with a recommendation that the enacting clause be stricken."

Mrs.

She graduated from Swarthmore College and received a master's degree in American civilization and an M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania.

Her mother is a sales representative at Merrill Lynch &amp; Company in New York.


A Nation's History in a Family's Heirlooms
EVERY FAMILY COVETS heirlooms and mementos -- from baby shoes to silver punch bowls.
But for families like the Vanderbilts, their faded snapshots and gilded memorabilia often shed light on larger historical events.
Five generations of Vanderbilts are recalled in two summerlong exhibitions of portraits and memorabilia in Newport, R.I.
The shows mark the 100th anniversary of the Breakers, the sumptuously furnished mansion built there by Cornelius Vanderbilt 2d.
He was a grandson of the family patriarch Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, who made his fortune in steamships and railroads.


For a Long-Term Answer
The state has moved to take over the Newark school system, and has already done so in Jersey City and Paterson.
Is this the best way to correct troubled schools?
Is there a better way?
I do not see the state as being necessarily interested in long-term solution.
The difficulty with invoking the holy name of capitalism is, in part, its predisposition to short-term thinking.

To the Editor:
Mr.

The Brooklyn Academy of Music has presented more than music for some time now.

Now the arts complex is planning to build a movie theater.
The academy plans to open a multiscreen arts cinema next summer in the Owen Carey Theater, one of its four performance spaces.


Fresh Taste, Simplicity and Low Cost
FINDING a quick, no-frills lunch where the food is freshly made can be more of a quest than it sounds.
At the following twosome, however, the food tastes fresh and the setting is simple but agreeable.
THE HARVEST BAKERY in Salisbury is in a pale yellow frame house with white trim just off the main thoroughfare.
In addition to excellent breads (including crusty Italian, sourdough baguettes, foccacia, seven grain and cinnamon raisin), there are several soups and as many as 18 salads available daily to take out or eat in.
And after 4 P.M., there are 12 gourmet pizzas (including smoked salmon, Mexican, vegetarian and fruits de mer).

A Business Deal Makes a Point for China
At first glance, China's selection of Mercedes-Benz over the Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company to be a partner in a $1 billion mini-van plant looks like a clear sign that American businesses will pay a steep price for the political bickering between Washington and Beijing.
But the mini-van deal, announced on Wednesday, is probably a better sign of something else: China's ability to make a decision for business reasons and, by carefully timing its announcement, have it look politically motivated.

Gallic Revelry With a Windmill as a Backdrop
ACROSS the Shinnecock Canal and a world away from the innocent pleasures of carousels and other summer delights from another era evoked by the Carousel Ball, the Friends of the Hampton Library in Bridgehampton will be the host of an evening of Gallic revelry on Saturday.
The library benefit will be on the grounds of the Beebe Windmill on Ocean Road under a tent decorated to copy the famous Moulin-Rouge de Paris Cabaret.
The music will come from an accordion, naturellement.
Cancan dancers will give an appropriate hint of naughtiness, and the host, Jean-Claude Baker, will greet guests in the suave French-accented fashion familiar to fans of his New York restaurant, Chez Josephine.
Mr.
Baker, who has a house in East Hampton is the restaurateur and writer, and an unofficially adopted son of Josephine Baker, whose devotion to her inspired his best-selling book, "Josephine: The Hungry Heart."

Emergency Room Option: Free Ride to Hospital's Clinic
On a recent, typical morning, paramedics rushed an ashen-faced heart attack victim into the emergency room at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center while a pregnant woman suffering from a psychotic episode was whisked to the mental ward.
A nurse walked by and said to no one in particular, "This is a madhouse."
In the midst of this bustle, Josue Celadilla waited quietly with a stomach ache.
Even if he had to wait for hours, he said, he preferred the emergency room to a local doctor who misdiagnosed his appendicitis last year as mere indigestion.


Airline Group Will Develop Aviation Internet
A new global system for communications with airplanes in flight, described as an internet for the aviation industry, will be developed by a private consortium of 11 airlines with help from the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency has promised.
The system would integrate communications between planes and air traffic controllers, planes and airline companies, and planes and other planes, the agency said on Thursday.
Somewhat like a cellular telephone system, it would locate an airplane anywhere on the globe, and then choose the best method to communicate with it, whether a conventional radio link to the nearest ground antenna or a link to a satellite.


Postman Takes Heat For His Short Pants
IN certain circles, it has been clearly understood for generations: white shoes are simply not to be worn before Memorial Day.
A less well-known fashion edict, but one that apparently has consequences even more dire than social condemnation, has been promulgated by the postmaster here.
According to his rules, mail carriers are not to wear their regulation shorts before Memorial Day.
During a time when the county has recently been cited for having the worst mail delivery in the continental United States -- second only to San Juan, P.R., for poor on-time performance in the country -- and when stories of postal violence regularly crop up in the news, regulations concerning uniforms may not seem like a priority issue for the United States Postal Service.
But Daniel Gislao, a Mount Vernon mail carrier who was recently disciplined for violating the rule, believes it is this type of petty bureaucratic harassment that is symbolic of problems in bigger areas.

Airlines Setting Up New Safety Programs
Acting on recommendations by the Government, many airlines have set up new programs intended to improve aviation safety.
The Federal Aviation Administration said last month that after an industrywide meeting on safety in January, 20 airlines had started evaluation programs and 18 carriers had set up safety offices with a mandate to provide independent oversight of their own operations.


A Town Draws Lines in the Shifting Sand
ALL the Borough Council of Monmouth Beach wanted to do Tuesday night was to mollify residents who showed up to protest strict new proposed regulations for the town's recently restored beach.
Looking relieved, Mayor Louis P. Sodano told the crowd that the ordinance, which would have outlawed using the beach after 6 P.M. and banned eating, ball-tossing, changing any article of clothing and an exhaustive list of other activities, had gone back to the legal drawing board for major revisions.
A new draft will be ready in the fall.


Allison Dietrich, Matthew Demetros
Allison Susanne Dietrich, the daughter of Kurt Dietrich and Susanne Kirtland Dietrich of New York, was married on Friday evening to Matthew John Demetros, the son of George Demetros of Waterford, N.Y., and Elizabeth Morgan of Narragansett, R.I.
The Rev.
John Cowburn, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony in the chapel at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in New York.
Mrs.
Demetros, 31, is the special events manager at the Los Angeles Music Center Opera in Los Angeles.
She graduated from New York University.
Her mother is the vice president of creative development at Estee Lauder Inc., the cosmetics company, in New York.
The bride's father, who is retired, was the art director at the former Mays department store in Brooklyn.


Accountability Required
The state has moved to take over the Newark school system, and has already done so in Jersey City and Paterson.
Is this the best way to correct troubled schools?
Is there a better way?


School Maintenance Money Is a Myth
"Schools Face Renovations of Aging Buildings"  [ June 11 ]  omits the fact that most school budgets voted on by the taxpayers included in them money for "maintenance," misleading residents into believing that the facilities were being properly maintained.
Instead buildings have been allowed to deteriorate while adequate funds have been spent on salaries, health plans, retirement pensions and other perks.
Then the boards come crying to the communities for multimillion-dollar bond issues to effect repairs to the inadequately "maintained" structures that suddenly need attention.
Similarly, the article neglects to point out that school populations are predictable in advance.
But school boards do not alert taxpayers to increases, but wait until it becomes a dire necessity, so as to milk more tax money for the "emergency."


Historic Palestine
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman defines "historic Palestine" as "the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean" (column, July 9).
The boundaries defined by the League of Nations also included the area east of the Jordan River, today the Kingdom of Jordan, 78 percent of historic Palestine.
The Arabs already have more than three-fourths of historic Palestine.

Bungee-jumping, speed rock climbing and sky-surfing (leaping from a plane wearing a snowboard-like contraption while your partner videotapes your acrobatics in midair for earthbound judges) have big appeal for sports fans these days.

Clean Living's New Look
As thrashing hard-core music blared, the dozen or so young men sitting on garage-sale furniture in a student apartment ticked off their enemies: the meat, dairy and alcohol industries; companies that test drugs on animals; those who scoff at their vegetarianism, and perhaps worst of all, "sellouts."
Sellouts are those who used to be what these youths are -- Straight Edgers -- and then made a wrong turn.
They began to drink beer, maybe took a nibble of beef jerky, perhaps smoked some pot.
They strayed.
They would have to be punished.


In the Region/Long Island; Insurers' Creed: Don't Go Near the Waterfront
THOUGH nearly three years have passed since Hurricane Andrew leveled its devastating assault on South Florida, property owners 1,500 miles north are grappling with the ghosts of the hurricane's 150-mile-an-hour winds and its $16 billion in losses.
From Long Beach to Montauk and all along the North Shore homeowners within sniffing distance of salt air have been digging deeper into their pockets lately to insure their property against the distant threat of natural disaster while an even more immediate threat looms on the horizon.

What to Do if There Is a Metro-North Strike
The Metro-North Commuter Railroad has announced contingency plans for Connecticut commuters to and from New York Cirty if there is a strike by railroad workers, which could come as early as this weekend.
Negotiations continued last week as the Connecticut Weekly section went to press.
If there is a strike, Metro-North said that bus service, provided by the Connecticut Department of Transportation, will run between major New Haven Line railroad stations in Connecticut and the Pelham Bay Park subway station in the Bronx.
Commuters may transfer to and from the No. 6 subway, the Lexington Avenue local.
The railroad said the special buses will operate weekdays only on the following schedules:  INTRASTATE SERVICE
For service within Connecticut, buses will depart New Haven and Greenwich every hour, on the hour, from 6 A.M. to 8 P.M., making stops at the above stations.
The fare will be $5 or less.
PRIVATE BUS SERVICE
Two bus lines offer service between the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan and some Connecticut locations.
Peter Pan serves New Haven, Bridgeport and Norwalk.
For information, 1-800-343-9999.
Bonanza serves Waterbury and Danbury.
For information, 1-800-556-3815.
IF YOU MUST DRIVE
Metro-North recommends car-pooling and parking at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx or Shea Stadium in Queens, near subway stops.
No parking when the Yankees or Mets are playing at home.
HELPFUL HINTS
The railroad recommends buying subway tokens in advance and carrying exact change for bus and parking.
The Metro-North information number is 1-800-METRO-INFO.
The Connecticut D.O.T. information number is 203-789-7190.
THE DOWNSIDE
Metro-North cautions that the alternative travel arrangements can serve only 40 percent to 50 percent of the regular daily commuters.


Two Addictions
To the Sports Editor:
Ira Glasser, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, asks why Mickey Mantle's alcoholism was treated in a sympathetic manner while Doc Gooden's addiction to cocaine evoked condemnation.
The answer is simple: When the public learned that Mantle was near death because of his liver condition, there was a spontaneous outburst of sympathy.
Under similar conditions, Gooden would have received the same reaction.

Cutting Losses on A Co-op
Q I purchased a co-op studio apartment in the late 1980's at the height of the real estate market.
Since then, the value of the apartment has plummeted to less than half my remaining mortgage.
No bank is willing to refinance and I'm currently losing hundreds of dollars each month on the apartment, which I now sublet.
Is the best short-term solution to walk away from the apartment and let the bank foreclose?
How will this affect my credit rating?
Are there any creative ways for me to sell the apartment and pay off the mortgage?
I've heard about lotteries, but I wouldn't know where to begin. . . .

On Sunday; Let's Face It, Cuomo Won't Sit for This
SOMEWHERE out there is an artist who may actually do what impenitent Republicans in the State Senate, conservative talk-show hosts on the radio and ill-mannered, illiterate scribblers in the press room did not do in 12 years in Albany: cut Mario M. Cuomo off at the knees.
The artist, Fran Lew of White Plains, has been commissioned to do a portrait of Mr.
Cuomo, whose predecessors' three-quarter-length images hang (with nary a knee to be seen) in the corridor outside Mr.
Cuomo's old office in the State Capitol.

Lew -- who has also painted the late Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir, and Mr.
Cuomo's wife, Matilda -- right up there with artists like Ritter Otto von Krumhaar, who painted New York's 33d governor, Theodore Roosevelt.

The World Series of Damage Control
WATCHING Hugh Grant try simultaneously to clear his name and promote his movie this week may have fed the public's fascination with the human frailty of Hollywood stars.
But for the city's leading publicists, always armed with a blueprint for battle, the story had a more clinical appeal as a kind of case study of their daily craft: damage control.
Presumably, they have seen, or spun, some version of this before.
As a publicist for Sony Music, Dan Klores recently helped defend Michael Jackson against charges of anti-Semitism.
Howard J. Rubenstein has run interference for New York City mayors and works on keeping George M. Steinbrenner 3d out of trouble.
Linda Gosden Robinson has had a hand in shaping the images of controversial corporate giants like F. Ross Johnson of RJR Nabisco and Michael R. Milken, the junk bond king.

'Made in Italy' Taste Starts With Fresh Vegetables
WHEN friends return from vacations in Italy, they invariably complain that the food simply doesn't taste the same here.
A plate of spaghetti with tomatoes and basil that tasted sublime in Positano or Siena is ordinary when made at home.
But now fresh, locally grown vegetables are coming into season.
When produce is cooked within hours (or even minutes) of being picked, and a good fruity olive oil is on hand, you can get close to re-creating that Italian flavor -- if not the setting.


New Yorkers Against New York
The House of Representatives indulged in some crazy fiscal logic last week.
It moved swiftly toward a vote that will almost certainly blow a hole in Federal spending for the arts.
At the same time, a House subcommittee approved $8 billion more than President Clinton requested for defense, including money for B-2 bombers the Pentagon does not want.
The arts savings would amount to $20 million for 1996, with funding set to end entirely in two years.
The comparison is telling.
Since the Pentagon does not want any more B-2's, the only explanation for expanding their production must be to protect defense-related jobs.
The freshman Republicans whose rebelliousness forced their elders to cut the arts budget more deeply than expected clearly regard museums and theaters as expendable in a time of tight fiscal discipline.

Critics Question Nicaraguan Army's Makeover
The metal name plate has been removed from the wall outside military headquarters, new shoulder patches are being made for soldiers, and the commander general is having a revised set of business cards printed.
Just short of the 16th anniversary of its triumphal march into Managua, the Sandinista People's Army has ceased to exist.
Instead, the force that toppled the Somoza family dictatorship on July 19, 1979, and fought a decadelong war with the American-backed Contras is now known officially as the Nicaraguan Army.
But whether that institution also has a new outlook and ethic to go along with its new identity is a matter of some debate here, in part because much of the top command remains in place.


Ghosts on the Palette
Like many other painters, R. B. Kitaj could let his work do the talking.
His interest in things Jewish and his obsession with exile and human brutality surface frequently in his work, from the lonely sepia-toned passenger sitting cross-legged in the train compartment in "The Jew Etc." to the tortured, ghostly gray-and-black figures caught in a blaze of yellow paint in "Germania (The Engine Room)." "Baseball" and "John Ford on his Deathbed" -- in which Ford, surrounded by ghosts from his films, wears an admiral's bridge cap and brandishes a rosary -- are archetypally American.
The assured style and all-too-certain troubles of old age are illustrated in "Bad Back," "Bad Eyes," "Bad Thoughts" and "Bad Heart." But Mr.
Kitaj, a 62-year-old Ohio-born painter who has made his home in London since the late 1950's, is also a man of many words.
And R. B. KITAJ (Rizzoli, $60) abounds in them.
The pages of books, old and new, are elements in many of his early collages; the names of writers and philosophers show up in his titles; Mr.
Kitaj's own fanciful tales and explanations of origins, references and meanings occupy full pages across vibrant reproductions of individual paintings.
In an interview with Richard Morphet, the keeper of the modern collection at the Tate Gallery in London and the editor of the book, Mr.
Kitaj comes across as articulate, funny, learned and humble.

No Age Can Trap Shakespeare the Chameleon
YOU WILL KNOW A THEATER CLASSIC BY the fact that it endures and prevails because of and despite the changes each generation or civilization brings to it.
I made this declaration one week ago, and now that I've seen new versions of "The Tempest" and "Hamlet," I'll continue to stand by it.
There's not a better test than Shakespeare, who wrote for the masses and for the courts, rough and slapdash as you please, then infinitely textured, using words as rhythms, as color, as weaponry, as melody, harmony and the roar on the other side of silence.
Cut or uncut, he can thrill or bore you nearly to death.
Who hasn't gone into a sulking fit when his rustic buffoons with their long-winded jokes take the stage? (Laughter may be universal; comic modes aren't.) Who hasn't had their senses confounded by one of those descriptive passages that gave Elizabethan audiences the sights and sounds their stagecraft couldn't but that our stagecraft duplicates and even competes with?


Early Treatment for H.I.V. Doesn't Prolong Survival, Study Finds
Treatment of H.I.V. infection before it causes symptoms may delay its progression to AIDS but does not prolong survival, a new study has found.

Reporters and editors were studying the phases of the moon, looking for patterns that might help them solve the case before the police.

A New Rock Festival Opens, In New York and on Line
Some institutions in New York remain institutions even after they collapse.
Last summer, the New Music Seminar, a 15-year-old music-industry smorgasbord of informational panels, live performances and business-card trading, closed its doors in the face of debt and unpaid employees.
This year, some Manhattan clubs have banded together to create a new music gala, the Macintosh New York Music Festival, which begins tonight and ends on Saturday.
It could be the first time that a rock festival is taking place simultaneously in clubs and on computer screens, with its own site on the Internet's World Wide Web.
There won't be informational panels or as much business-card trading at the new festival.
The concept is that with a $75 pass, anyone can hop around 15 clubs where more than 350 bands, from local rockers to nationally known alternative groups, will play over six days.

That sent them back to No. 18, where both players had four pars in regulation.

Mayor Rudolph Giuliani lamented a further loss of the "diversity of opinion" needed in a city as diverse as this one.

Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman has been the Forrest Gump of high technology, playing an obscure but crucial role in many key events since its founding in 1948 by two professors and a graduate student from M.I.T.
But recent deals have put the company in the spotlight, and it now seems poised to cash in on the enormous growth of the Internet.


As Germany Enters the Fray, Two Pilots Reflect an Altered Military
Beyond their training as pilots of the Luftwaffe, Hans-Georg Batcher and First Lieut.
Peter-Georg Stutz have little in common -- and much history dividing them.
Mr.
Batcher, 81, was a bomber pilot in World War II, a hero of the Third Reich decorated personally by Hitler.
He flew a staggering 658 combat missions -- a world record -- and was shot down twice, but survived to fly his last mission in February 1945, attacking a column of Allied troops entering the near-defeated Germany from the Netherlands.


A Small Town in the South Prepares to Try a Neighbor
As people down here like to say, it's all over but the shoutin'.
A jury of nine men and three women -- seven whites and five blacks -- is in place for the capital murder trial of Susan Smith, clearing the way for opening statements this week.
The jury will hear a polished, soft-spoken, Ivy League lawyer argue for her life with a plain-spoken young prosecutor who has gone against a rising community sympathy to demand her death.


FINANCE BRIEFS
Debt  Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, is selling $50 million of medium-term notes due in 1998 through Goldman Sachs.
Callable in one year, the issue is priced at par to yield 6.3 percent.
Norwest Corp., Minneapolis, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell as much as $3 billion of securities.


G.O.P. PROPOSING GREATER CHOICES ABOUT MEDICARE
House Republicans have begun drafting proposals to make immense changes in Medicare, by imposing annual limits on spending in the program and by giving elderly people a choice of private health insurance plans as alternatives to the standard Federal program.
Confidential documents prepared by Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee describe numerous options that would increase costs for Medicare beneficiaries who stay in the standard program, under which the Government pays separately for each doctor's visit and each hospital admission.
More than 90 percent of the 37 million Medicare beneficiaries receive care through such fee-for-service arrangements.


What France Risks With Nuclear Tests; Overkill Response
To the Editor:
The French Navy's raid on the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior II (news article, July 10) is a fitting prelude to France's coming nuclear tests in the South Pacific.
Paris has shown disdain for protests against setting off thermonuclear explosions in a part of the world often described as a paradise on earth.
How in character that the French respond to the presence of a rickety protest ship with tear gas and helmeted commandos.


The Mover Who Shook Newsday
For the 800 or so employees of New York Newsday who are asking why their newspaper had to die, the answer may lie in a speech delivered last month by Mark H. Willes, the recently appointed chief executive of Newsday's parent, the Times Mirror Company.
Mr.
Willes, who was addressing an audience of journalists and academics at the University of California at Los Angeles, said that Times Mirror needed to be "relentless in pursuing discontinuous change." If the company was really serious about improving its fortunes, he said, "you can't do it in small steps; you must take big, discontinuous steps to get there."


An Heir Apparent At Thompson
After months of speculation, the J. Walter Thompson Company has clarified who is most likely to become its next chief executive by designating as heir apparent Chris Jones, who has been executive vice president and managing director for multinational accounts in London since 1993.
"Chris has had a sterling record," said Burt Manning, 64, chairman and chief executive of Thompson, a unit of the WPP Group.
Mr.
Jones, who joined Thompson in 1984, is being named to the new post of co-president, joining Peter A. Schweitzer, 55, who last year declined the designation to remain in Detroit, where he is also the global business director on the Ford Motor Company account.


Iraq Frees 2 Americans After 4 Months
Two Americans who had been imprisoned since they crossed into Iraq four months ago were released today by President Saddam Hussein in what American officials said was an effort to persuade the United Nations to lift economic sanctions against his country.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said, however, that the United States had promised nothing in exchange for Iraq's sudden decision to release the two men, William Barloon, 39, and David Daliberti, 42.
Mr.
Hussein released them after Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat, appealed to Mr.
Hussein in a one-hour meeting this morning to free them on humanitarian grounds.


Edward Gray, 78, United Auto Workers Official
Edward F. Gray, a former union official who began his career recruiting factory workers in New Jersey and ended it by organizing the elderly in New York, died on Thursday at the Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan.
He was 78 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Lois.


Squatters Have to Live by the Same Rules as Everyone Else; The 'Day Job' People
To the Editor:
Your July 12 article misrepresents the people who are squatting in buildings on East 13th Street in Manhattan.
You state they are "largely white, well-educated and employed." Most of them are indeed educated, but in the fine and creative arts.


In Chicago, Week of Swelter Leaves an Overflowing Morgue
They came like a parade of death: police truck after police truck, delivering the bodies to the Cook County morgue, until finally there was no more room for the dead.
Wicked heat is being blamed for hundreds of deaths across the eastern half of the country, and perhaps 300 deaths in Chicago alone, said Edmund Donoghue, the medical examiner for Cook County, where refrigerated trucks are being used to store the overflow from the morgue.


Abroad at Home; Lessons Of Disaster
Two days after the fall of Srebrenica, Gen.
Philippe Morillon, a member of the French General Staff, said: "We have to declare war on General Mladic or get out." Ratko Mladic is the commander of Bosnian Serb forces, the architect of the assault on Srebrenica and the ethnic cleansing that followed.
General Morillon's words pithily summed up one lesson of Bosnia for the Western alliance: To intervene in a conflict and pretend there is no difference between the aggressors and the victims is not only dishonorable but ineffectual.


U.S. to Auction One-Year Bill This Week
The Treasury's schedule of financings this week is confined to the bills market, beginning with today's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills.
On Thursday, the Treasury will auction a one-year bill.
By the close of the New York cash market on Friday, traders said, the rate on the outstanding three-month bill was 5.41 percent and a six-month bill was 5.35 percent.
The rate on a one-year bill was 5.21 percent.


The Serenity of the Spa Meets the Blare of Change
Joe H. Palmer, a college professor and classicist who used to write newspaper columns about horses, said it best: "A man who would change Saratoga would stir champagne."
For the 127th year in its tranquil history, starting Friday, they will stage racing at the old Saratoga Race Course in the serene and stately village snugged into the foothills of the Adirondacks.
And while nobody is planning on stirring the champagne, the new team of executives running the New York Racing Association is mixing some change into a racing jewel that has resisted change for a century while outperforming its sister tracks at Belmont and Aqueduct downstate.


Another Proposed Pathmark and Another Debate
WELCOME to Pathmark II. Or is it Pathmark Too?
First came Pathmark I, the proposed supermarket in East Harlem so controversial that after years of planning, it's still on hold.
Now come plans for another Pathmark megastore, this one in Springfield Gardens, Queens.
And New York being New York, its fate is shaky too, even though the idea goes back six years, originated with a community organization, has the approval of the local Congressman, the Mayor, the City Planning Commission, the Borough President and half of an evenly split community board.


5 Famous Men and What They Learned at Annapolis
THE NIGHTINGALE'S SONG  By Robert Timberg  Illustrated. 544 pages.
Simon &amp; Schuster. $27.50.
The idea that moved Robert Timberg to write "The Nightingale's Song" seems to have been to take five famous graduates of the United States Naval Academy and show how their training at Annapolis imbued them with values that subsequently made them military heroes: Senator John McCain, John M. Poindexter, Robert C. McFarlane, James Webb and Oliver L. North.
He would then dramatize the sense of betrayal these men felt when America turned against the Vietnam War and spell out the tragic consequences of their feelings.
In light of his own background as a graduate of the Naval Academy and a Marine veteran of Vietnam, he would write in a spirit of indignation over what he saw as the American middle class's abandonment of the country's patriotic heritage.


CHRONICLE
When JANE MARSH steps onto the Summerstage platform in Central Park on Wednesday to sing the lead in Verdi's "Due Foscari," she may seem to many a new face and voice.
But longtime opera connoisseurs will remember her.
In 1966, when she was 24, Ms.
Marsh, a soprano, burst into international prominence when she won the first vocal prize at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow.


In the World of Women Who Live by Their Bodies
Rosie, an aging tart in Yorkshire, puts it this way: "We don't matter. We're just scum. Cockroaches!" Rosie, born Rosemary Christine Garrity, is one of the prostitutes figuring prominently in "Band of Gold," a six-hour Granada TV mini-series that had hordes of Britons glued to their television sets earlier this year.
Getting there before public television, HBO snapped up the series, which, beginning tonight, will be shown on three successive Mondays.
Rosie has the enormous advantage of being portrayed by Geraldine James, the gifted actress perhaps best known for her shimmering turn in "The Jewel in the Crown."


Faith of Our Mothers
To the Editor:
It is heartening to read of John Paul II's support for women's liberation in his letter to the United Nations conference (news article, July 11).
It is disheartening to hear again that this good man will tolerate "no change in the church's position barring women from the priesthood."


What France Risks With Nuclear Tests
To the Editor:
I commend you for calling on the French President, Jacques Chirac, to show courage and statesmanship by canceling France's proposed nuclear tests in the South Pacific (editorial, July 5).
His announcement has caused outrage in Australia and other South Pacific countries and is provoking a response from organizations around the world from Greenpeace to the European Parliament.


Take a Stand, but Please Stop Telling Us About It
Sometimes it seems that Major League Baseball, with its capital letters and boldly underlined issues, is at once "War and Peace," "As The World Turns" and every comic opera all in one.
In other words, it seems like life and death, that is until a life-and-death situation takes place, forcing one to step back from The Game.
And when that happens, then you are forced to disconnect to an extent, staying tuned only through the proverbial umbilical cords.
The radio.
The newspapers.
The fans.


Funds for Fighting Drugs
Thirty-one housing authorities in New Jersey received Federal grants of $11.2 million Wednesday to fight drugs in public housing.
The money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development can be used to hire security guards, set up tenant patrols, install lighting gates and other security equipment, and set up drug education and treatment programs.
Newark's housing authority will receive the most money: $2.7 million.
TERRY PRISTIN


Pending Execution of Former Radio Reporter Divides Organization of Black Journalists
The scheduled execution of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a black former radio reporter convicted of killing a police officer, has intensified debate among black journalists over how, or even whether, their national association should deal with the case.
Mr.
Abu-Jamal, 41, is to be executed by lethal injection on Aug. 17 for the fatal shooting of a white Philadelphia policeman in August 1981.
His 1982 conviction was upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and the United States Supreme Court refused to review the case.
His lawyers filed another court appeal, which is pending.


What Goes On?; Why You Still Can't Buy A Flaming Pink Computer
They have infiltrated our offices and our homes, those computers.
They dominate the omnipresent technological landscape.
They come in many varieties with a myriad of performance speeds, accessories and price tags.
Yet one constant remains -- their color.
Computers have been relegated to the gray zone.
Putty gray, to be precise -- if you're talking about most personal computers.
The designers of Apple computer cases, however, call their color snow white.


New Plant Means More Clams
The number of clams available from the Raritan Bay-Sandy Hook area tripled last weekend and the number of people working to harvest them more than doubled with the opening of a new cleaning plant, said Richard Pomasan of the Baymen's Protective Association, which operates the Highlands plant.
The new plant and a smaller one in Sea Bright will process 360 bushels of clams a day, compared with 120 bushels when the smaller plant was operating alone.
The clams will be available locally and also shipped to other areas of the country and Europe, Mr.
Pomasan said.
The cleaning process involves exposing the clams to ultraviolet light for 48 hours.


Bosnian Refugees' Accounts Appear to Verify Atrocities
As rebel Serbs moved in on a second United Nations protected area in eastern Bosnia, Muslim refugees from the so-called safe area the Serbs captured last week gave new, detailed accounts today of the killing and rape of civilians.
Reconstructing precisely what happened in the safe area of Srebrenica is almost impossible at this point because of the chaos among the thousands of refugees here and the fact that many seem traumatized and disoriented.


'Farewell My Concubine' Lives Again as Opera
You've seen the movie; now catch the opera.
Chen Kaige spun his remarkable epic film of 1993, "Farewell My Concubine," around a thread of themes and images from the renowned Chinese opera of that name.
Now those tantalizing glimpses come together in a superb representation of the opera at the Taipei Theater, with Wei Hai-ming, a Taiwanese actress, in the title role.
No one who saw Ms.
Wei's exquisite rendition of "The Tipsy Concubine" three years ago at the Taipei Theater will need to be reminded of her ability to command the stage, or persuaded to renew the acquaintance, though this "Concubine" is, to be sure, a tale of a different sort.
Here, too, the heroine imbibes freely, this time with her lord, the historic King Hsiang Yu, who is impossibly trapped by his warring enemies.
But far from finding oblivion, she reaches the clear-headed conclusion that she constitutes one burden too many on the caring King's overwrought mind and slits her throat with his sword.


Collins Is Humbled by Millionaire Status
Hours after signing a contract that could pay him more than $23 million over the next seven years, a humble KERRY COLLINS began the task of trying to live up to the Carolina Panthers' expectations.
The rookie quarterback from Penn State agreed to a long-term deal Saturday night and took part in the team's first workout of training camp yesterday morning at Wofford College in Spartanburg, S.C.
Then, he tried to put into perspective how it felt to become a multimillionaire.


Jean Bony, Art Historian, 86
Jean Bony, a French-born art historian who taught at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1962 to 1980, died on July 7 in Australia.
He was 86.
His death was reported on Saturday in Le Monde.


Julian Schnabel Revisits The 80's, Directing
The weekend heat wave was enough to bring on hallucinations, and there was a good one Friday night on White Street in lower Manhattan.
Outside No. 77, site of the legendary Mudd Club, the brass stanchions and velvet ropes were set up once again.
And just as in days of yore, the hip were being separated from the unhip by Joey Arias, the club's very first doorman, hard to miss in a foot-high Little Richard quiff and pencil mustache.
Julian Schnabel, the painter, wandered over to the stanchions, conferred with a member of his film crew and obtained an adjustment in the distance between the stanchions.
Satisfied, he returned to the director's chair and the cameras began to record another scene in the life of Jean-Michel Basquiat.


The Internet battles a much-disputed study on selling pornography on line.
HELL hath no fury like an Internet scorned. Just ask Martin Rimm.
Last year, as an undergraduate studying electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Mr.
Rimm wrote a research paper called "Marketing Pornography on the Information Superhighway."


Most Wanted; 'Pocahontas' Has Some Company
"Pocahontas" is not the only movie that is enchanting children this summer.
The Disney animated film earned a mere $8 million this weekend, but that was enough to pass the magic 100-million-dollar mark: in its fifth week, the Disney film's gross sales are $106.2 million.
"Casper," though not in the top ten this week, has topped $85 million, "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" has earned $30.5 million, and "Indian in the Cupboard" took in $7.8 million this weekend, its first.
And that's not counting "Batman Forever" ($164.5 million) and "Apollo 13" ($90.6 million).


Heat Ebbs but 11 Are Dead in New York City
The heat wave that scorched much of the Northeast with record-setting 100-degree temperatures killed at least 11 people in New York City, who died of causes like hyperthermia and heat stroke, city officials said yesterday.
Officials were only beginning to assess the impact of Saturday's withering heat spell, which caused several power failures outside the city, damaged roads that buckled under the fierce sun and led thousands to seek emergency medical help.


Waco Witness Says N.R.A. Consultant Posed as a House Aide
A child welfare worker subpoenaed to testify at Republican-led hearings into the Government's actions at Waco, Tex., said today that she was summoned to testify after being interviewed by a National Rifle Association consultant posing as a House committee staff member.
The witness is Joyce Sparks, who was a supervisor at the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services and who had extensive contact with members of the Branch Davidian sect before Federal agents tried to dislodge them from their compound near Waco.
She said in a telephone interview today that she had been contacted by a woman who said she was part of the "Waco hearing team" and who asked her about her dealings with David Koresh, the Davidian leader.


Gold Hunters, Defying Beijing, Mine Vast Areas of Rural China
A frenzied and chaotic gold rush is under way across vast expanses of rural China, where newly wealthy "gold lords" and the peasants who toil and fight for them are challenging the authority of the state.
Here in the far western province of Qinghai and in other parts of China, modest gold deposits, long under the exclusive control of the Communist Party and state mining combines, are being overrun by a wave of entrepreneurial and well-armed private miners.


World News Briefs; Attacks on Diplomats Strain Egypt-Sudan Ties
Relations between Egypt and the Sudan, already tense over Cairo's allegations that Khartoum was involved in an assassination attempt on President Hosni Mubarak last month, were further strained today as the countries traded accusations of assaults on each other's diplomats.
A Sudanese Embassy spokesman said three diplomats were attacked as they left their homes this morning by gangs of up to 15 men who beat and kicked them.


Market Place; The Tech Stocks Defy Gravity and Rewrite Conventional Wisdom
Conventional wisdom has it that the second quarter brings a slump to the producers of computers, software, semiconductors and disk drives.
Not so this year.
With a few exceptions, the companies that have reported second-quarter results have met or exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates, sending already lofty prices of technology stock to new highs on an almost daily basis.


Squatters Have to Live by the Same Rules as Everyone Else; News Management

In Possible Signal, China Releases an Ailing Dissident
China freed a prominent dissident this weekend, and human rights advocates are taking his release as a signal that Chinese leaders may be willing to take a softer stand in their diplomatic dispute with the United States.
Yang Zhou, 51, the best-known dissident in Shanghai, was allowed to return to his home on Saturday, apparently because he is in poor health.
Mr.
Yang said today that prison doctors had diagnosed a tumor in his throat but that he did not know if it was cancerous or benign.


Equity Offerings Scheduled for This Week
The following equity and convertible debt offerings are expected this week:


For Infant Ears, a New, Early Test of Health That Takes Just a Minute to Do
Less than 9 hours old, Lisa had just passed an important test with flying colors, and her parents, Ruth and Richard Minkoff, could not have been more pleased.
"Now we know Lisa's as perfect as she looks," Mr.
Minkoff, a computer specialist from Forest Hills, said.


Patents; Books provide lively insights into how patents and trademarks help shape business strategy.
DON'T look on the best-seller lists for books about intellectual property.
In fact, it's hard to find books about patents and copyright anywhere but in stores that specialize in business and law, and those are usually volumes with titles like "World Patent Law and Practice," "The Mechanics of Patent Claim Drafting" or "Understanding Copyright Law."
So it's worthwhile to note two recent books that take a comprehensive and entertaining look at a broad subject: the new role that patents, copyrights and trademarks play in the economy, in culture and in corporate business strategy.
Both are available at popular bookstores.


Charges for Japanese Cult
The police served arrest warrants today on 12 members of the Aum Shinrikyo religious cult for murder in connection with a nerve gas attack a year ago in Matsumoto in central Japan.
The 12 were already in prison on other charges, mainly in connection with the gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March, when a dozen people were killed and 5,000 injured.


Bringing the Murder Rate Down
The astonishing decline in New York City crime rates, especially for murder, has been attributed to everything from demographic changes to the freezing weather of two winters ago.
But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the Police Department seem entitled to claim that, despite its discipline and corruption problems, the city's law enforcement machinery must be doing something right.
Police crackdowns on drugs and illegal possession of guns are surely among the factors that helped make New York City safer.
There have been improvements in crime rates in the past, but each time the lulls were followed by surges in violent crime.
Some 10 years ago criminologists were hopeful that a decline in the young adult populations would lead to safer streets.
Then along came crack cocaine and an explosion in crime in the late 1980's.
Many experts say now that a coming bulge in the population of young adults will lead to growth in crime in the next several years.


Essay; News About Jews
Jewishness in America is not a growth industry.
Fifty years ago, there were about five million Jews in the U.S.
Today there are a half million more, about a 10 percent increase -- while the total U.S. population has doubled, from the postwar 130 million to today's 260 million.
That means the percentage of Jews in America has declined from nearly 4 percent to 2.3 percent.


People
Paul Spencer, a copywriter, was named to the new position of co-creative director at the New York office of Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, sharing those duties with Kevin Kearns, an art director.
Mr.

Metro-North Braces for Strike 'at Any Time' After Talks Fail
Metro-North workers could strike at any time, leaders of the railroad's labor unions warned yesterday after contract talks broke off despite significant movement by management on wages and work rules.
Preparing for a walkout, the railroad will have 400 buses ready this morning to ferry riders, if need be, from counties north of New York City and Connecticut to take them to subway and bus stops in the Bronx, Donna Evans, a spokeswoman for the railroad, said.


Rap Performer Is Victim Of Carjacking in Harlem
Queen Latifah, the rap star and television actress known for her lyrics denouncing violence, was a victim of a carjacking early yesterday in Harlem in which her boyfriend was shot and critically injured.
The carjacking took place about 2:45 A.M., shortly after Queen Latifah had parked a green 1995 BMW 740i at the northwest corner of Martin Luther King Jr.
Boulevard and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, in front of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, the police said.
Also in the car were the rapper's boyfriend, Sean Moon, in the front passenger seat, and a close friend, Lynn Mayo, in the back seat.


Distant but Loyal: Little Sicily in Queens; Immigrants Congregate in Astoria But Leave Their Hearts in Castrofilippo
The giant onion of Castrofilippo went unnoticed in Rome and Naples, and barely got a mention in the towns near the tiny Sicilian village where it was grown.
But it was news this summer in Astoria, Queens.
"Six pounds," marveled Salvatore Marino, an Astoria resident for 26 years.
"That is a big, big onion."


Accounts
Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co., Hartford, to Emmerling Post, New York, as the first agency to handle its account.
The billings were estimated at $2 million to $4 million.
Citterio USA, Long Island City, Queens, a unit of Citterio S.p.A., to the Ad Store, New York, to handle advertising for the specialty meat company, previously handled by Armando Testa, New York, which closed.
The billings were estimated at more than $3 million.


New York City Water
Searing heat reached New York City at a bad time for the water system.
Rainfall has been minimal in the watershed since spring, and the upstate reservoirs that supply city water have been well below normal all year.
On July 5 a drought warning was declared, urging voluntary water conservation in New York City and Westchester.

Interactive Media Begins Samplenet
There were several developments last week involving interactive media.
Interactive Media Works in Overland Park, Kan., is introducing Samplenet, a software package intended to offer computer users free access to the World Wide Web through home pages sponsored by advertisers.
As part of efforts to sign Samplenet sponsors, Interactive has opened an office in New York and named Lawrence D. Ostrow, a former CBS sales executive, as Eastern managing director.


Apple Computer to Offer 2 New Macintosh Models
Apple Computer Inc. will introduce two Macintosh models today in its consumer-oriented Performa line, offering aggressive pricing and advanced multimedia features.
The machines play to Apple's strengths in the publishing, education, multimedia and consumer markets.
The two models, together with software and services aimed at specific market segments, will help Apple regain market share this year and next, Michael Spindler, Apple's president and chief executive, said at a news briefing.
Rather than compete across the board with PC clones of dubious quality, Mr.
Spindler said, Apple will focus its efforts.
Though its overall market share is about 8.3 percent, in certain markets the Macintosh has a dominant share, and this can be increased, he said.


For Sale: Memories Of a Camelot Wedding
To the public, who has seen it in photographs, Hammersmith Farm is where Jack and Jackie Kennedy held their wedding reception on the lawn in 1953, and where the bride tossed her bouquet from the staircase.
To Hugh D. Auchincloss 3d, whose family owned the estate for four generations, it was his boyhood summer home, a place where his crush on Jackie Bouvier deepened into friendship soon after his father, Hugh Auchincloss Jr., married Jackie's mother, Janet Lee Bouvier, in 1942.


Serbs Close In on 2d Bosnian 'Safe Area'
Bosnian Serb troops, supported by tanks and artillery and facing light resistance from Bosnian Government forces, advanced to the edge of the Muslim-held town of Zepa today, pressing an attack to capture the second of three enclaves in eastern Bosnia designated as "safe areas" by the United Nations.
"Bosnian Serb infantry, supported by tanks and heavy mortars, are within 1,500 meters of Zepa," said Alexander Ivanko, a spokesman for the United Nations in Sarajevo.
Bosnian Serb troops, who reached the outskirts of the town late in the morning, were reported to be pressing their assault from the Zepa River in the west, but appeared to have halted their advance by late this afternoon, Mr.
Ivanko said.


You Push; I'll Navigate


Editorial Notebook; The Not-So-Mysterious East
Old Asia hands who revisit the Far East in search of the past inevitably come down with a bad case of nostalgia-shock.
The visitor realizes, with some sadness, that progress has exacted a price, imposing architectural and commercial conformity on what was once a collection of endlessly variable destinations.
Almost nothing is familiar.
Bangkok, once one of Asia's most charming cities, is self-destructing.
The water-filled klongs that crisscrossed the city and gave it much of its charm were long ago filled with concrete to create gridlocked streets.
Elevated highways are sprouting above the streets, part of the city's plan to cut down travel time between the airport and Bangkok's plush hotels.


Harnisch Stays in Command and Helps Mets' Luck Turn
If there was any one pitch that Pete Harnisch might have liked to have back yesterday, it probably would have been a fourth-inning offering to Mike Kingery.
But the pitch didn't even hurt the Met right-hander.
Ryan Thompson ran down Kingery's fly ball deep in the right-field corner, and just looking at the box score would never reveal that the play could have meant something.
But the very fact that the ball stayed in the park meant a whole lot to Harnisch.


By the Sea, by the Sea, By the Cool, Noisy Sea
At 3:30 A.M. on the night after New York's hottest day this summer, Frances Nimmons and her four children finally cooled off.
The temperature hovered at a merciful 79 degrees, down from 102, and a gentle breeze lifted their bedsheets.
"This almost feels like heaven," Ms.
Nimmons said.
The only problem was the noise.
"With the waves crashing here in front and the roller coaster behind us, I don't think we're going to get any sleep tonight," she said.


Melbourne Journal; Crown Is Wobbly, but Long Live Betty Windsor!
It is 4 in the afternoon, teatime in this most Anglophilic of Australian cities.
At a corner table in a tea shop heavy with chintz and etched glass, Nancy Neish, an 82-year-old retired clerk, daintily brushed away crumbs of buttered cinnamon toast from her lips as she explained why she would always feel loyalty to a monarch half a world away.
"Oh, what a wonderful woman," Miss Neish said of Queen Elizabeth II, who is -- at least for the moment -- still the head of state of Australia, a nation that began its modern history as a land of British castoffs and convicts.
"I am an Australian and I am loyal to my Queen. When she talks, you know she's talking from the heart."


Sports of The Times; Evert Is Reunited With Her Doubles Partner in Chief
AFTER all these years, there is yet another view of Chris Evert, competitor.
This one comes from George Herbert Walker Bush, a retired public servant who used to invite Evert to play doubles with him.
Rank, he was soon to learn, had few privileges.
" 'Bend your knees, cover behind me, get up to the net,' " he mimicked her orders.
"As President, people would give me long putts, or if I put up a lousy lob, people would give me a kinder, gentler return. Chris Evert never understood that."


Florida Gets $100 Million in Insurer Failure
Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and a law firm have agreed to pay the State of Florida $100 million to settle charges involving the biggest failure of an insurance company in Florida's history.
Merrill, the nation's largest brokerage house, will pay $45 million of the settlement.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accounting firm, will pay $50 million, and the New York law firm of Shereff, Friedman, Hoffman &amp; Goodman will pay $5 million, Florida officials announced Friday.
The three firms will be severed from a trial that is to begin in September.


Newark Schools Chief Embraces a Daunting Test
Dr.
Beverly L. Hall slid into a student desk at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan and began helping two seventh graders work through a series of reading puzzles.
Within minutes, she spoke up.
"We won," she said to the teacher.
"We won. We finished."
Dr.
Hall, 47, has long been driven to win.
But today, as she assumes the post of acting superintendent of the Newark schools, she faces turning around a system that has been collapsing for decades, marked by falling test scores, poor attendance and crumbling buildings.


The Draw Was Only First Step For Pacer
Last Tuesday, John Campbell won a lottery.
But the million-dollar payoff didn't come until Saturday night, when Campbell captured the Meadowlands Pace with David's Pass.
Campbell and David's Pass, who teamed to win the Pace by three-quarters of a length over the hard-charging Kinney Hanover, had an even-money chance of not even starting in harness racing's most prestigious pacing event.

There seldom passes a day in the life of Buck Showalter when he is not asked about the progress of a power hitter by the name of Strawberry in Columbus.
It's odd, of course, because what the Yankees need to cultivate is pitching, and lots of it.
Yesterday, Showalter's Yankees did get to reap some of what they need most.
Mariano Rivera, the young right-hander whose entrance into the 1995 season was not the most smashing, turned in a third straight impressive outing.
The 25-year-old threw six-plus innings of one-run ball against the Minnesota Twins to earn a 5-1 victory.


Dividend Meetings
Following is a partial list of dividend meetings this week:


Disarming Must Precede Irish Peace Talks
To the Editor:
Peter Martin (letter, July 11) suggested that the British Prime Minister set a date for all-party talks in Northern Ireland.
A good idea.
But I would like to make four points:
(1) The British Government has been working toward all-party talks.
But these will not happen simply by naming a date.
Sinn Fein must deliver some movement on decommissioning first.
Other parties will not sit at a negotiating table with Sinn Fein while the I.R.A. reserves the option to revert to violence.


F.C.C. Chief Urges Repeal Of Network Prime-Time Limit
The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission said over the weekend that a 25-year-old commission rule limiting the amount of network programming that television stations can broadcast at night was "a mistake going back as long as 10 years." The chairman, Reed E. Hundt, added, "It's high time the commission stops this mindless meddling with prime-time programming."
The F.C.C. regulation, known as the prime-time access rule, has kept the networks from supplying their programs during the highly watched 7 to 8 P.M. time period in the East and West, and the 6 to 7 P.M. period in the Midwest.
The rule, which was intended to diversify programming, has made hits out of syndicated programs like "Wheel of Fortune" and "A Current Affair."


65 M.P.H. Limit Favored in Poll
A majority of New Jersey's drivers want the speed limit on the state's highways increased to 65 miles per hour, and 75 percent admit they drive that speed or faster, the Asbury Park Press reported yesterday.
The poll showed that 58 percent of those responding thought the speed limit should be raised on interstate highways in New Jersey; 56 percent thought it should be increased on the state's three toll roads.
Under Federal law, New Jersey could increase the speed limit to 65 m.p.h. on hundreds of miles of highways.
But Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman has said the increase would lead to more highway fatalities.


METRO DIGEST
HEAT TOOK 11 LIVES IN NEW YORK CITY
The steamy heat wave that scorched much of the Northeast with record-setting 100-degree temperatures killed at least 11 people in New York City.
They died of heat-related causes like hyperthermia and heat stroke, city officials said.
Officials were only beginning to assess the impact of the withering spell, which caused several power outages outside the city, damaged roads that buckled under the fierce sun and led thousands to seek emergency medical help.
And as temperatures cooled to the mid-80's, weather-beaten residents of the region emerged from the icy zones of air conditioners to share grim tales of survival and relief that the record heat had ended.
"It was like being smacked with a baseball bat," said Kenny Anderson, 34, a construction worker from Poughkeepsie, which reported the highest temperature in the state -- 106.
"I laid under a tree with wet towels over me. It became too much work, every half hour changing towels. They dried right out. I lost five pounds yesterday just from the sweating."  [ Page A1. ] NEW YORK CITY RAP PERFORMER IN CARJACKING
Queen Latifah, the rap star and television actress known for her lyrics denouncing violence, was a victim of a carjacking in Harlem in which her boyfriend was shot and critically wounded.
The carjacking took place shortly after Queen Latifah had parked a BMW at the northwest corner of 125th Street and Eighth Avenue, in front of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, the police said.  [ B3. ]
ANOTHER PATHMARK, ANOTHER SPLIT
Welcome to Pathmark II.
First came Pathmark I, the proposed supermarket in East Harlem so controversial that after years of planning, it's still on hold.
Now come plans for another Pathmark megastore, this one in Springfield Gardens, Queens.
And New York being New York, its fate is shaky too, even though the idea goes back six years, originated with a community organization, has the approval of the local Congressman, the Mayor, the City Planning Commission, the Borough President and half of an evenly split community board.

A COOL IDEA IN CONEY ISLAND
Scattered along the beach at Coney Island like so many confused sunbathers, Frances Nimmons, her two sisters from Brooklyn and their 11 children had joined about a dozen other families who sought refuge from the oven heat of their apartments by bedding down instead with the sand and surf.
Some people escaped the weekend's heat by going to malls; others packed movie theaters.
But perhaps among the most adventurous were the beach sleepers of Coney Island, who found that returning to nature was preferable to their saunalike apartments.  [ B5. ] REGION HOW DEEP THE INKWELL?
All of a sudden, they did not have a New York City newspaper anymore, except a shadow of one in Queens.
So the people of New York Newsday -- the famous ones whose pictures were on the sides of buses, as well as the ones who were just newspaper people -- started to think about the future.
For the stars, like Mike Lupica, the sports columnist, whose salary is said to be in excess of $500,000, job security was not the issue; most of them have contracts with the paper's parent, Long Island Newsday, which will continue publishing, and their writing is syndicated to many other papers across the country.
But for others, it may not be so easy.
Executives have said 700 to 800 of the 3,200 employees at New York Newsday and its Long Island parent will lose their jobs under a system based on seniority.

FOR INFANT EARS, AN EARLY TEST OF HEALTH
Less than 9 hours old, Lisa had just passed an important test with flying colors, and her parents, Ruth and Richard Minkoff, could not have been more pleased.
The baby girl, the Minkoffs' first child, is one of an estimated 5,000 newborns whose hearing will be checked in a free minutelong test over the next year at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, Queens, on the Nassau County border.
The federally financed four-month-old program, being instituted at seven hospital centers throughout New York State, is aimed at the early detection of diminished hearing in the hope of averting learning and development problems.  [ B4. ] Chronicle B6


Cuts May Affect Princeton Lab
The main funding source for the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in Plainsboro would be slashed under a spending bill passed last week by the United States House of Representatives.
The bill, which reflects the House's disappointment over the progress of fusion research in the last four decades, would reduce Federal financing for it by 38 percent, to $229 million.
The bill does not specify how cuts would be distributed.


U.S. Is Urged To Repay Some in Radiation Tests
A draft report prepared for a Presidential panel says that the Federal Government should compensate some of the thousands of people who were made unwitting subjects of radiation experiments by Government researchers during the cold war era and should issue a blanket apology to all subjected to the tests.
The report also states that the panel found evidence that the Government covered up several experiments, perhaps illegally, to prevent embarrassing publicity, and it warns that the nation still lacks sufficient safeguards to prevent similar abuses in research practices.


4 Injured in Shootout in Upper Manhattan
Four men were injured, one seriously, in a shootout between two men in upper Manhattan last night, the police said.
The incident began when two men started shooting at each other shortly after 10:30 P.M., near Broadway and West 149th Street, said Officer Valerie St.
Rose, a police spokeswoman.
One of the two gunmen and three bystanders were struck by gunfire, Officer St.
Rose said.


A Debate Over H.I.V. Testing of Newborns Raises a Congressman's Profile
In his 12 years in Congress, Representative Gary L. Ackerman, a Queens Democrat, has been known as much for his flamboyance as for his legislative record.
The plump and affable Mr.
Ackerman sports a white carnation boutonniere each day and lives on a houseboat on the Potomac River that he named the Unsinkable II (after the Unsinkable I sank).
While his colleagues walk or take the subway two blocks to the Capitol from the Rayburn House Office Building, Mr.
Ackerman cruises over in his Aunt Chachi's clunky 1966 Plymouth Valiant.
Before strolling into the House chamber to vote, he stops to give a security guard a crushing bear hug.


Taking In the Sites; Photographs and Memories: A Century of Americana Images
Hiding behind a deceptively bland home page lurks one of the World Wide Web's most intriguing sites, a place where serendipity is the rule and surprises abound.
American Memory, a rapidly expanding site owned by the Library of Congress, is a fascinating repository of thousands of images from the 1850's through World War II, and its portfolio is growing.
For New Yorkers, especially, this site is a trove of wonders.


Fantasies Deteriorating Into a Battle of Wills
James Edwin Parker's unsettling drama "Two Boys in a Bed on a Cold Winter's Night" is by no means the first play to depict the driving force in New York gay life as the quest for an unattainable fantasy.
But this two-character dialogue at the Theater Off Park is one of the first plays to analyze the dynamics of the hunt in sexually explicit terms.
In doing so, it displays a nasty, critical acuity.
The touching but flawed drama, which runs just over an hour, is a 5 A.M. postcoital conversation between two men who have met in a Manhattan bar and gone home together.
The getting-to-know-you banter between Daryl (Robert Gomes) a desperately lonely 36-year-old graphics designer, and Peter (Michael Curry), a cocky jack-of-all-trades who is the same age, is conceived as an archetypal gay male pas de deux in the age of AIDS.
Roles are discussed, first sexual experiences recalled, H.I.V. statuses questioned and lies exposed in an edgy conversation that turns into a hostile battle of wills.


Saberhagen to Miss a Start
After re-evaluating Bret Saberhagen's condition yesterday, the Mets confirmed that their ace right-hander has a strained muscle in his lower left side and that he will miss his scheduled start on Thursday in St.
Louis.
Saberhagen, who was forced to leave Saturday night's 5-4 loss to the Colorado Rockies in the third inning after experiencing pain, will be evaluated again in four to five days.
And Dave Mlicki will probably make the start on Thursday.


Shrinking Gap Between Church and Polish State
As Poland has worked during the last four years to write a new constitution, the Roman Catholic Church has become intimately involved in the process, wielding decisive influence on some important provisions.
The church has an official observer on the drafting commission, mobilizing the bishops into action on potential problems.


Open Title Confirms Career Move
The future of women's golf arrived today wrapped in a black ribbon.
Annika Sorenstam, by way of Stockholm, the University of Arizona and a tennis backboard, seized the 50th United States Women's Open at the expense of a mortified Meg Mallon.
Mallon, the third-round leader, lived in the rough, the bunkers and the water this afternoon, but she snorkeled her way out and nearly forced a Monday playoff.
Her 20-foot putt on the steep 18th green at Broadmoor dribbled straight toward the hole, detoured away and left a 24-year-old Swede dazed.


Chirac Affirms France's Guilt In Fate of Jews
Barely two months after taking office, President Jacques Chirac today publicly recognized France's responsibility for deporting thousands of Jews to Nazi death camps during the German occupation in World War II.
His statement put an end to decades of equivocations by successive French Governments about France's wartime role.

Not a Laugh Riot: Comedy Writers in Short Supply
Just as professional sports teams struggle to find enough quality players to fill each position during an expansion year, the number of television comedies has grown so much this year that television executives say they are worried that there will not be enough quality comedy players -- in this case, writers -- to go around.
This summer in Hollywood, 59 comedies are going into production, up from about 45 last year.
The demand has been increased because of the addition of two new would-be networks -- WB and UPN -- and the growing interest among cable networks in producing original comedy programs of their own.
In addition, aggressive moves to develop a base of comedy shows are being made by new production studios like Dreamworks and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment.


New Chapters of Whitewater and Waco
Hoping to unearth politically embarrassing revelations, Congressional Republicans will begin hearings this week on two of the most sensitive issues that have confronted the Clinton Administration: the Whitewater affair and the Government's assault on the Branch Davidian sect near Waco, Tex.
Although preparations for the hearings have produced no major revelations, the proceedings are expected to prove highly distracting for the White House because it is already dealing with Bosnia, the budget and a re-election campaign in which the President's character is certain to be challenged.


New Charges in Shooting
Prosecutors have dropped murder charges against a man who had been accused of killing a retired police chief from Hanover, N.J., saying they had arrested another suspect.
On Saturday, Willie E. Drewery, 20, of Newark, was charged with murdering the former chief, John Deventer, 65, who was shot while trying to help two elderly friends who had been set upon by robbers during a visit to a cemetery.


Bank Picks Agency, As Does Blockbuster
Two marketers have changed agencies on their accounts.
Blockbuster Entertainment in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a unit of Viacom Inc., named Foote, Cone &amp; Belding in Chicago to handle the account of its Blockbuster Music retail chain, which had been handled by D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles in St.
Louis for the last two years as part of the overall Blockbuster account.
The billings were estimated at $35 million.
Foote, Cone, part of True North Communications, was awarded the music stores account after a four-month review that was narrowed to that agency and the New York office of Young &amp; Rubicam Inc.


Mordechai Gur Is Dead at 65; Army Chief and Entebbe Planner
Deputy Defense Minister Mordechai Gur, a former army Chief of Staff and the general who led the capture of the Old City of Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, killed himself today, weary of a long battle with cancer.
He was 65.
The Israeli police said Mr.
Gur had shot himself in the head with his pistol in the garden of his home in Tel Aviv.
He left a note saying he did not want to be a burden to his family.
Mr.
Gur had undergone cancer treatment in recent years, and although he continued working, he was visibly weakened by the disease.

Companies Use Web Hoping to Save Millions
The Internet's World Wide Web -- that great repository of data -- has yet to become that great market.
But right now a number of innovative service-oriented companies are using the Web not to make money but to save some -- and not nickels and dimes either, but possibly millions of dollars.
For companies ranging from overnight package deliverers to banks, the Web is the place to offer technology-savvy customers a new convenience: automated customer service.
In the process, these companies are finding that a Web site is a lot cheaper than operating customer phone banks.


Six Virtues, Enlightenment, Very Zen
At the beginning of her new work, "Paramita," Sun Ock Lee, a Korean-born choreographer, offers an invocation to Buddha with a throaty, roaring chant.
At the end, she and her five acolytes -- all women -- plunge into a percussive symphony, beating batons against a group of hanging drums.
Suspended above them, sculptured instruments -- part chimes, part mobiles -- move in the air.
Along the way, the women have occasionally sunk into stillness with meditative force and a man has painted calligraphic brush strokes on their bodies.
Another man whose martial-arts display seems to come from another world is nonetheless included in the choreographed bows taken at the close by the dancers and the musicians.

History Catches Up With Sony Music
The king of pop has been dethroned by a cartoon princess.
And that's hardly good news for Sony Music Entertainment.

Bridge
Far back in the mists of bridge history, it became the habit to lead king from an A-K combination, or from a K-Q combination.
This traditional treatment is still standard in many circles, but the ambiguity often creates problems for the leader's partner.
A slightly better method, long popular in Britain, is to lead the ace from an A-K holding, reserving the king for a K-Q combination.
However, there is still some ambiguity, for the lead of the ace may or may not indicate the king.

Nomo Hard to Hit Or Know
Hideo Nomo, rookie pitcher and sudden icon, sat before his locker thumbing through a Japanese paperback, headphones plugging his ears, and succeeded, once again, in sealing himself from the mounting frenzy around him.
Upstairs in Dodger Stadium, young men and small children in Nomo T-shirts and Nomo caps hurried past pockets of middle-aged Japanese tourists who hovered close to their tour guide, getting directions to their seats.
In this desultory baseball season, the personality of the moment is Nomo, who is the first Japanese pitcher in 30 years to pitch in the major leagues and who, in a scant two months, has forever destroyed the image of the male Asian athlete as a slight and polite young man who can win by smarts but never by strength.
The Dodgers may love Nomo for packing the house, and Japanese may adore him for showing what a local boy can do against the big leaguers.
But for Japanese-Americans like Brian Niiya, Nomo is the best thing to come along since Bruce Lee martial arts movies -- even if Nomo remains aloof.

THE widowed mother wished for her son to recall his father as a human being, not a baseball god.
That wasn't always easy, for the boy grew up with a videocassette player and a stack of highlight tapes.
One of Michael Munson's favorites was the 1978 American League playoffs, the home eighth inning of Game 3.
His father, the Yankees' scruffy catcher, caught hold of a Doug Bird pitch with a man on and his team trailing Whitey Herzog's Kansas City Royals by a run.
Thurman Munson was no Reggie Jackson, except on this day, when his right-handed swing produced a majestic drive to the bullpen in left-center field, sending the Yankee Stadium crowd into a frenzy and his team on its way to a 2-1 playoff edge and eventually a triumphant World Series.

Anyone can watch a Nascar Winston Cup race, like Sunday's Miller Genuine Draft Pocono 500, for the usual reasons: love of speed, anticipation of crashes, stirring comebacks, great drafting, or how to get a pit crew to come to your house and change your tires and spark plugs in 19.8 seconds.
But to me, the Pocono 500, like virtually any other race, is about corporate logos, a constant and remarkable parade of symbolic might visible to any viewer or fan.
Shameless, excessive, effective mercantilism!

International Briefs; France Plans to Sell More State-Held Assets

Pataki Leads G.O.P. Surge In Campaign Contributions
Gov.
George E. Pataki raised $1 million in campaign contributions during his first six months in office -- an amount believed to be unprecedented for a new governor, according to campaign contribution reports made public today.
In the clearest sign of how the state's political landscape has changed in just one year, Mr.
Pataki and other Republican state leaders raised more than $4 million between January and early July -- almost triple what their Democratic counterparts raised during the same period, the records show.


U.S. to Investigate Whether Agents Attended Racist Event
Expressing outrage at the possibility that Federal firearms agents may have attended a country picnic with blatant racist and anti-Semitic themes, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin today ordered two top officials to report to him on the matter within 120 days.
Mr.
Rubin said, "We condemn as totally abhorrent the participation of law-enforcement officials" in the activities at the event in Tennessee in May.
The annual weekend gathering, "The Good Ole Boys Roundup," was open to white law-enforcement officers and featured things like the sale of licenses to hunt blacks, who were repeatedly referred to by a racial epithet.

Some 3,000 to 4,000 Bosnian Muslims who were considered by United Nations officials to be missing after the fall of the Srebrenica enclave have made their way through enemy lines to Bosnian Government territory.
"We don't know for sure, but we estimate that about 3,000 people crossed last night," one relief official said today, while Kris Janowski, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said some 4,000 people, including women, children and Bosnian Government troops, crossed some 30 miles through forests to safety.

Medical Errors Bring Calls For Change
A FEW hours after the chief neurosurgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City operated on the wrong side of a patient's brain on May 26, hospital officials knew he had made a horrendous error.
The doctor had operated on the healthy part of the brain after looking at another patient's X-rays.
Two weeks later, on June 10, after an initial inquiry, the cancer center suspended the doctor, Ehud Arbit, from his surgical and administrative duties.
On June 21, and only in response to a reporter's inquiries, the hospital publicly acknowledged the error.
People going into hospitals expect to be made better, not worse.
Yet a large number of preventable errors occur in the nation's hospitals, and the mechanisms for quality control are not firmly enforced.
Critics say that the main hospital accrediting agency, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., is an unaggressive watchdog that announces most of its visits in advance and rarely bites anyone hard enough to leave a mark.

New York's Lieutenant Governor, ELIZABETH P. McCAUGHEY, a Republican, has called off her engagement to WILBUR L. ROSS JR., a wealthy Wall Street investment banker and a Democrat, The Associated Press reported yesterday.
"I am no longer engaged to be married," Ms.
McCaughey said in a telephone interview.
"It's a very personal decision, and it was made obviously after considerable thought. We'll remain friends."


Orangina Chooses Wunderman Cato
Orangina USA, which is owned by Groupe Pernod Ricard in Paris, said yesterday that it had selected Wunderman Cato Johnson in New York to handle strategic, creative and media assignments including the general advertising account, which were previously handled by various agencies on a project-by-project basis.
The billings were estimated at $3 million to $5 million.
Wunderman Cato, the direct-response unit of Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., was chosen after a two-month review that was narrowed to that agency and three undisclosed shops.


Witness Says Abortion Doctor Neglected Patient Who Died
On the first day of testimony in the trial of a Queens doctor accused of murdering a patient who died after a failed abortion, a prosecution witness described the doctor as a greedy man who ignored the patient for more than an hour as she bled to death in his storefront clinic.
The witness, Maria Cabrera, 22, of Jackson Heights, Queens, was working as a receptionist at the clinic, Metro Women's Center, in Corona, Queens, when Guadalupe Negron died there on July 9, 1993.
Yesterday, she told prosecutors in State Supreme Court in Jamaica, Queens, that her boss, Dr.
David Benjamin, knew that Ms.
Negron was about 20 weeks pregnant, not 13 weeks, as his lawyers have maintained.


Juan Manuel Fangio, 84, Racer Who Captured 5 World Titles
Juan Manuel Fangio, the Argentine who was the first great race driver of the postwar era, died yesterday morning in Buenos Aires.
He was 84.
Fangio, the sport's only five-time world champion since the modern Formula One series began in 1950, died at a hospital where he was admitted last Friday after contracting pneumonia, said Marcelo Gaffoglio, who represented Fangio in the United States.
He had been suffering from kidney failure for several months, Gaffoglio said.


Crab Warnings Are Ignored
Warnings of unsafe dioxin levels in blue crabs caught in Newark Bay have not stopped people from catching them, eating them and selling them, a scientist said yesterday at a meeting sponsored by the Coast Alliance, an environmental group.
Angela Cristini, a biology professor at Ramapo College, said she recently saw hundreds of people in a Bayonne waterfront park crabbing, The Associated Press reported.
For years, officials have issued warnings about blue crabs, which feed on animals that absorb dioxin from contaminated sediment.

It's a Wash As Yankees Tie Chicago In the Rain
Don Mattingly's line drive soared through the pouring rain toward the left-field bleachers last night.
Soaring with the wet baseball were the Yankees' hopes that Mattingly would carry them to a victory.
Forget it.
Although the ball glanced off David Martinez's glove for a double, Mattingly was left stranded on second base after the game was called a few minutes later in the bottom of the seventh inning because of rain.
The Yankees and White Sox played to a 1-1 tie and so the game will be replayed entirely today as part of a doubleheader beginning at 4:05 P.M.

A Festival Undeterred by Rain
The annual Aix-en-Provence summer music festival opened punctually at 9:15 P.M. one evening early last week, but not as planned.
A thunderstorm suddenly emptied the outdoor courtyard at the Archbishop's Palace of audience and orchestra alike, leaving Louis Erlo, the festival's longtime director, staring angrily at the sky.
It was not a good omen.
Last year, France's oldest music festival barely escaped closing, able to offer only eight performances of a single opera.
This year, for its vaunted "rebirth," the festival scheduled three operas to be performed six times each.
And now the opening night looked certain to be canceled.

The Travelers Group Inc. surprised analysts yesterday by reporting second-quarter profits that were well above Wall Street expectations.
The earnings were driven by strong gains at the company's Smith Barney brokerage unit and solid performances by its other businesses.
The insurance and financial services company said net income for the quarter climbed nearly 27 percent, to $405.9 million, or $1.22 a share, from $320.5 million, or 93 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1994.

Pointing Up Bach's Virtues
Contrary to popular misconceptions, Johann Sebastian Bach was not a fuddy-duddy out of touch with his time; nor was he some servile functionary with no ego.
Making these points was one of the accomplishments of the superb period-instrument musicians from Aston Magna, a festival ensemble based in the Berkshires, in their concert on Sunday evening at the air-conditioned Corpus Christi Church.
The performance of Bach's Sonata in E major for Flute and Basso Continuo, written late in his life, demonstrated that the old master was well aware, thank you, of what was going on around him.
The music has a minimum of complex counterpoint and a prevalence of tune-and-accompaniment texture, then the rage.
The clarity was enhanced by the use of a crystalline fortepiano instead of a harpsichord.
We now know that Bach was so taken with this emerging instrument that he became the Leipzig sales representative for a fortepiano maker.


A Top Officer Is Leaving Bear Stearns
One of Wall Street's best-paid executives, John C. Sites Jr., an executive vice president and director of the Bear Stearns Companies, resigned yesterday, saying he wanted to devote more time to his family and to charity work.
Mr.
Sites, 43, who was earning more than $14 million a year, built up Wall Street's largest mortgage-backed securities business for Bear, Stearns &amp; Company, the company's brokerage unit, and was a co-head of the firm's taxable fixed-income group.


A Vote to Trim School Day And Allow Larger Classes
Saying they have few places left to cut, members of the Board of Education yesterday endorsed a plan by Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines to allow local school districts to shorten the school day and increase class size for some elementary school students as a way to save money.
The proposals were widely criticized by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the school unions and parent groups as harmful to children.
But board members said that, faced with the latest budget cut of $250 million by the city, they had no choice but to give superintendents the flexibility to increase class size in first, second and third grades to 27, from 25, and to reduce the number of hours of weekly instruction in elementary schools to 26 hours, from 27 and a half.

The Westinghouse Electric Company has indicated to the chairman of CBS, Laurence A. Tisch, that it is interested in buying the company for about $80 a share, or about $5 billion in cash, two people with knowledge of the talks said yesterday.
Shares of CBS surged yesterday after Dan Dorfman said on the CNBC financial news cable channel that Westinghouse was planning to offer $83 a share for CBS.
The stock closed up $4.125, or 6 percent, at $69.75, on a trading volume more than three times its daily average during the last three months.

The Hardest Hole in Golf
This is the hardest hole in major championship golf, 461 yards of sheer misery.
It has brought strong men to their knees, put weak men on their backs and brought tears to the eyes of many a British Open pretender.
This is the Road Hole, the 17th at the Old Course at St.
Andrews.
It is a par-4 graveyard, a pitiless stretch of bumpy ground, cavernous bunkers and high weeds.
And that's the easy part.
Miss the drive to the right, toward the Old Course Hotel, and it's out of bounds.
A wayward second shot is on the road to the right, or in the Road Hole bunker to the left, a deep hole that resembles a grass-bricked prison cell minus the bars.

Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a group created to provide loans to the poor in developing countries omitted its name, and referred incompletely to the involvement of the World Bank.

Corrections
An article in Business Day on July 1 about the announced sale of a 50 percent stake in Bolivia's state-owned electricity company to three United States companies referred incorrectly to the ownership of one company, Energy Initiatives Inc.
It is a subsidiary of the General Public Utilities Corporation, not independent.

Boston Subway Cars Crash, Injuring 32 and Closing Line
A subway trolley car rammed into another that was stopped at a platform here this morning, injuring 32 people and halting service on one subway line through the evening rush.
No one was killed, but the driver of one car was critically injured.
A spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority, which runs the subway, said the cause of the crash was unknown.


Lost Japanese Sub With 2 Tons of Axis Gold Found on Floor of Atlantic
LONGER than a football field, the Japanese submarine I-52 was carrying more than two tons of gold and hundreds of tons of other metals and raw materials to the Nazi war machine when she was sighted on June 23, 1944, by allied forces in the Atlantic.
An American bomber swept out of the midnight sky and dropped a torpedo.
The pilot, listening to undersea sounds radioed by acoustic buoys, heard an explosion and a metallic groan as the submarine lost air and sank with more than 100 men.
Debris found floating the next day included fragments of silk and a Japanese sandal.
For half a century the warship lay hidden in the depths of the Atlantic.
No diver, submersible or robot ever uncovered her grave, the exact location of which was a mystery.

Jimmy Key talked about the future and the past, about pitching again and not pitching again and about pitching like the old Jimmy Key and pitching like an impostor.
A shoulder injury that the Yankees realized last year could get worse is preventing Key from throwing another changeup this season and is forcing him to think and think some more.
Sporting a fresh three-inch scar where his left rotator cuff had been repaired on July 5, Key returned to the Yankees' clubhouse for the first time yesterday since having surgery and Manager Buck Showalter immediately tried to insert him into the rotation.
Not really.
Showalter could only dream that Key will return.
It surely will not be before next spring training, if at all.


Ex-Paratrooper Drilled a Company Into Sale Shape
When Albert J. Dunlap took the podium with Wayne R. Sanders at a Manhattan news conference yesterday to announce the $7 billion merger of the Scott Paper Company and the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, one analyst, speaking sotto voce, dubbed them "the odd couple."
Indeed, the 48-year-old Mr.

Dunlap, who at 57 still looks every inch the tough-talking former paratrooper who dropped into Scott Paper 15 months ago.

Though the billings were not disclosed, Adweek estimated they could reach as much as $100 million by 1997.


Tyranny of 10
Why do Asian students do better in mathematics than American students, finishing first in international exams while Americans aren't even close?
Over the years, the question has received many different answers, and now yet another has emerged.
Not long ago, Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, cited an article in a London weekly, the Times Educational Supplement, which blamed the English language.
The article suggested that the reason Asian students do better is that their languages more clearly reflect the structure of our common 10-based number system.

U.S. Sees French Plan Taking It to War's Brink
Senior American military officials have concluded that a French plan to mount an aggressive defense of besieged enclaves in Bosnia would bring the United States and its allies to the brink of war with the Bosnian Serbs.
American commanders said they could agree to fly thousands of French troops to besieged Muslim enclaves only if gunship escorts blasted Bosnian Serb air defenses and NATO warplanes hunted Bosnian targets at will, without the United Nations approval they now require.

Reporter's Notebook; Commuters Hop Trains and Hold Breath
Henry Posner's neat beige suit and pressed blue shirt belied his inner turmoil as he strode toward Track 33.
He had missed the early train home and had one more chance to get back to Yonkers before his daughter's day-care center closed -- the 5:14 P.M.
"If I don't pick her up by 6, she's out on the street," Mr.
Posner said.
Echoing sentiments expressed by a variety of commuters in the crisscrossing streams flowing home through Grand Central Terminal last night, Mr.
Posner said he did not appreciate the possibility that the northward rush of trains might screech to a halt at any moment.


Arts Phase-Out Stays on Course in House
Advancing toward a vote that would end all Federal financing for the national endowments for the arts and the humanities in two years, the House of Representatives tonight turned aside efforts both to extend that time frame and to shorten it.
After four hours of debate, Republicans and Democrats agreed to continue talking tonight on about a dozen amendments but to delay a vote on them and the final bill until Tuesday.
But members left little doubt that the final outcome would be to adhere to a decision reached last week to finance the endowments at $99.5 million a year for 1996 and 1997 and then cut off all Federal money.


Harry Guardino, 69, an Actor In Romantic and Gangster Roles
Harry Guardino, the tough-talking actor who supported himself by working at odd jobs before establishing a career in movies and television and on the stage, died yesterday at Desert Hospital in Palm Springs, Calif.
He was 69.
The cause was lung cancer, said Lee Snellings, Riverside County's supervising deputy coroner.

Good manners are breaking down on the Internet.
Rudeness, even savage insults filling the E-mail.
Assorted species of porn flourishing.
The good fellowship of the nerds poisoned, souring into the bad fellowship of the electronic jungle.
It makes me glad I resisted when everybody was saying it was the future, and the train was leaving the station, or the rocket was leaving the pad, or the bauds were leaving the modem, or whatever, and not being on it would leave you stranded.


Mugunga Journal; A Refugee Camp Hums With the Spirit of Home
In the haze of cooking fires, crowded roads and back-to-back thatch huts, "Chez JoJo -- Hotel -- Bar -- Boutique" sticks out pristine white, bigger than almost any other structure here, except perhaps the huge tanks that provide clean drinking water to this sprawling refugee camp.
Its large rectangular frame is covered with a white plastic tarpaulin stamped across the roof with the blue emblem of the United Nations refugee agency.
And it even has a front patio, its dirt floor swept clean and separated from the noisy, dirty road by another piece of tarpaulin, this one cut in thin long strips.

Jumping the Age Barrier


Belmont's Reviews Are Mixed
Belmont Park ended its 57-day spring-summer season yesterday and the massive move to Saratoga for five and a half weeks in the country started.
But racing will begin upstate on Friday with the same uncertain business trends of the past few years: Attendance and betting at the track continue to slip, while betting away from the track continues to gain.
Depending on how you looked at it, business was either booming or shrinking at Belmont.
And the New York Racing Association chose boom over bust.


Vote on Regulatory Powers Thwarted
Senate Democrats, struggling to preserve Federal regulatory powers against a bill that would sharply limit them, turned aside a Republican effort to cut off debate tonight and force a vote on the measure.
The vote set the stage for an intense tug of war between the sponsor of the bill, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, and hisDemocratic opponents.
The Democrats seek fundamental changes in the bill, especially in provisions that reopen existing regulations to review and that provide new avenues for industry to appeal costly environmental, health and safety regulations.
Mr.
Dole and his allies, including some conservative Democrats, will seek to win enough Democratic votes to pass the bill without altering the measure too much.


Fashion That Hasn't a Clue
There is a reason couture draws so many retailers, who don't buy it.
There is a reason the showings of men's wear draw so many women's magazine fashion editors, who don't feature it.

It is because those collections have usually offered clues for the next women's ready-to-wear season.


Corrections
An article in Business Day yesterday about a strike against the joint operating company that prints The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News referred incorrectly to the status of 2,800 newspaper carriers, whom the company wants to make independent contractors.
They are independent carriers; they are not represented by a striking union, the Teamsters.
The union opposes the company's plan, saying that a number of district managers, who supervise the carriers and are members of the union, would lose their jobs as a result.
The article also misstated the share of profits each newspaper receives under the joint operating agreement.
It is 50 percent; The Detroit News does not receive 60 percent.


Clues on Faltering Memory in Aging
People lose their ability to memorize and recognize new things as they grow older, and researchers say this appears to be due to an age-related decrease in activity in certain areas of the brain.
Tests measuring blood flow to areas of the brain while people perform memory tasks indicate that younger people exhibit more activity in different areas of the brain when encoding new information than do elderly people.

Adolescents Say Drugs Are Biggest Worry
American adolescents overwhelmingly see drugs as the greatest problem they face, far outranking crime, social pressure, grades or sex, according to a survey released yesterday by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
Thirty-two percent of the young people aged 12 to 17 who were surveyed named drugs as the greatest problem for people their age, more than double those who mentioned crime in school, the next most common worry.


New York City Toll Is Increased to 14
The death toll in New York City from the recent heat wave rose to 14 yesterday as city medical officials attributed 3 more deaths to the record-breaking heat.
Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city's Medical Examiner, said autopsies yesterday revealed that 3 more people had died of heat-related causes like hyperthermia and heatstroke during the weekend, in addition to the 11 cases already identified.


Couples Is a Question Mark
Now that Fred Couples has withdrawn from this week's British Open because of recurring back problems, he can expect a call from Lanny Wadkins.
Wadkins, the captain of the United States team for this year's Ryder Cup matches, said he wants to find out just how bad Couples's back problems are, and whether he should consider Couples for a spot on the team.
The first 10 places on the roster are earned on a points basis, but the captains of each team can fill two more at-large berths with golfers of their choice.
The matches will take place Sept. 22-24 at the Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, N.Y.

Prosecutors Play Simpson Exercise Tape, Seeking to Show His Physical Ability
Prosecutors today began playing portions of an exercise video O. J. Simpson made two weeks before Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman were slain, seeking to show that anyone lithe enough to perform exercises akin, as Mr.
Simpson can be heard to say on the sound track, to "doing the Watusi" was also capable of killing.
As outtakes from the video were played, Mr.
Simpson's voice, breathless but jocular and resolute, resonated throughout Judge Lance A. Ito's courtroom for the first time in five months, when a very different Mr.
Simpson could be heard on the tape of a 911 call made by his former wife.
The jurors watched raptly as Mr.
Simpson, an exercise coach and others went through their cardiovascular paces, running in place and doing pushups and body bends.

MTV's Low-Cost Way of Business
Talk is cheap.
And increasingly so is television talent.
Talk shows have long been luring pathetic souls, eager to spill their guts in a national forum, with little more reward than a limousine ride from the airport, and not necessarily round trip.
Then came "reality" shows, offering everything from cops on the beat to what is billed as America's funniest videos.
In effect, reality equals cheap talent.
These formats don't have to deal with actors demanding bigger salaries as the show climbs the ratings charts.
Who needs the ego trips of a David Caruso?
Get nobodies for virtually nothing, and today's bottom line salivates.


An Exploration of Interaction? Or Noble Savagery?
Pilobolus Dance Theater has fully regained its old air of intimacy and collaboration this season.
And that spirit breathed extra life into "Pyramid of the Moon," an intriguing new duet presented on Friday night at the Joyce Theater.
Set to atmospheric music by Patrick Smith, "Pyramid of the Moon" was choreographed in typical Pilobolus fashion by two of the company's four directors and early dancers, Alison Chase and Michael Tracy, and the performers of the piece, Adam Battelstein and John-Mario Sevilla.
In the piece, Mr.
Battelstein is dressed in a formal frock coat, shirt, tie and pants.
Mr.
Sevilla, who enters perched on Mr.
Battelstein's shoulders, wears only an abbreviated dance belt.
The next few moments are taken up with each man climbing down and up the other's body.


Stop the Regulation Machine
President Clinton has said that the efforts in Congress to change the way Federal regulations are made "would let polluters delay and sometimes even control the rules that affect them." Such scare tactics have clouded real debate about how to whittle away the excesses of bureaucracy without sacrificing public health and safety.
In the Senate, the proposal sponsored by Bob Dole, the majority leader, would simply make sure that agencies undertake cost-benefit and risk-assessment studies so that the regulations the Government adopts are sensible -- that they save lives and protect the environment without imposing needless costs on business and the consumer.


179 Dead in Chicago Heat Wave As National Toll Reaches 360
The confirmed death toll exacted by a brief but brutal heat wave here increased to 179 victims today, but hundreds of bodies were yet to be examined.
Edmund Donoghue, the Medical Examiner for Cook County, estimated that the total number of deaths caused by the heat could reach 300 or more.
The heat wave, which began last Wednesday with a temperature of 97 and peaked at 106 on Thursday, was finally breaking.
Temperatures fell to the mid-80's today, with cooler weather expected for Tuesday.

Ashe on Monument Avenue, where five memorials honor heroes of Dixie.
But the City Council intervened after hundreds of calls of opposition.

THERE are those among us who speak a different language, which only resembles English.
Of course, language changes, and many speakers and writers who communicate with large audiences are reluctant to change their language as rapidly as their language itself changes.

As I read the President's memorandum on religious expression in schools (text, July 13), it appears to me that it is hardly possible to reach an agreement in our society or even to know what the real issue is, without giving a clear definition of "prayer" and "religion." Both words are often misinterpreted and in most contexts, including the President's speech, used in an undifferentiated, ambiguous manner.

How a Flat Tax Can Be Middle-Class Friendly

In "The Gephardt Tax Plan" (editorial, July 11) you argue that pending major Republican plans for tax restructuring "twist the code against middle- and low-income families." And in "The 10% Solution" (Op-Ed, July 13) the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt, makes the same argument, claiming a flat tax "would raise taxes for everyone who earns less than $200,000 and cut them for all earning more than that." This is not so.


Last U.S. TV Maker Will Sell Control to Koreans
In the early 1950's, more than 90 American companies made television sets.

LG Electronics Inc., the South Korean manufacturer whose products sell under the Goldstar name, announced with Zenith that it would lift its stake in that company to 57.7 percent from the current 3.8 percent.
It will gain control by paying $10 a share, or more than $350 million, for a combination of newly issued and existing Zenith common stock.

During the day, 17 of the railroad's unions and its management agreed to resume negotiations -- which on Sunday had broken off -- at 10 A.M. today.
But with the unions still refusing to rule out a strike or a slowdown, the uncertainty that plagued commuters yesterday seemed likely to hang over them again today.

Store Project In Queens Has Backing In Council
Despite opposition from some neighborhood merchants, several members of a key City Council subcommittee yesterday said they would support plans to construct a 65,000-square-foot Pathmark supermarket in Springfield Gardens, Queens.
After hours of testimony in a packed Council chamber from residents, religious leaders, politicians and others, Council leaders said a vote on the issue would be put off until today.
But the statements of support from several Council members suggested that it would be difficult for opponents to derail the plan, which has deeply divided the middle-class Queens community.


Formality vs. Beasts at Play
Order and disorder were the subtexts when the summer series Dances for Wave Hill opened on Wednesday at the lush environmental center in the Bronx.
There was a sense of neat formal elegance to "Distant Voices," created by Aspassia Yaga, Daniel Tai and their choreographic cooperative, Kipos, to music by Glen Velez and Enzo Rao.
But the five dancers in Victoria Marks's "Slow Maple Round," danced to music by Guy Klusevcek, could have been cheerful beasts at play in the wilds.
Facing out over the Hudson River and waiting for "Distant Voices" to begin, one gradually became aware of a woman sitting with her back to the audience in one of the center's handsome Adirondack chairs.
One body lay on a nearby stone bench, another on a balustrade.
Suddenly the piece began, but behind the audience, as a dancer oozed and twisted through a rooted solo that gave her the look of a bit of garden statuary.

After all, the project had gone spectacularly bust in 1992 just after opening, helping bring down his Toronto-based company, Olympia &amp; York Developments, and costing him and his family billions of dollars.
But there was Mr.
Reichmann one day this past spring, inspecting Canary Wharf's 10 buildings and surveying the crowds that work in them.
At his shoulder was Laurence A. Tisch, chairman of CBS and one of the world's leading investors.
What they saw must have impressed them, because within weeks Mr.
Reichmann, with financial backing from Mr.
Tisch and others, was bidding to buy Canary Wharf back from the 11 British, American, Canadian and other banks that seized it three years ago.


Chess
It is a good idea to follow the example of the great players -- but not when they bluster.
After the Professional Chess Association's world champion, Gary Kasparov of Russia, lost a critical game to the French grandmaster Joel Lautier in mid-May, he blurted out that he forgot to play a move that would have won for him.
There were many players who were dubious about Kasparov's suggested replacement move, but one of his admirers, the Swedish grandmaster Jonny Hector, enthusiastically copied it anyway.
Hector also got zapped, even worse than his hero.
He was playing the newest English grandmaster, Matthew Sadler, in the Malmo International Tournament in Sweden in early June and he tried to show that his hero was right all along, that White's gambit should win.
The trouble was that Sadler had critically studied the Kasparov-Lautier game and decided that the champion had been only posturing, and that Black should win.
When they met in Round 8, Sadler scored a punishing victory.


Market Place; Man bites dog on Wall Street: a takeover stock's price falls.
TAKEOVER speculators have been piling into the Scott Paper Company's stock for weeks, betting that the Kimberly-Clark Corporation or a rival paper maker would make a play for Scott.
They were right, but for many of them it turned out to be a losing bet.
Yesterday's formal announcement of the widely rumored acquisition came at a price less than the level at which Scott shares traded for much of the last three weeks.

Bally, the Swiss luxury-goods maker, is centralizing its design and promotions in an attempt to regain its cachet with affluent baby boomers in search of classic design.
The move is calculated to end the sort of local product development and marketing that helped make Bally's suede boots and signature sneakers the footwear of choice among Jamaican reggae stars.


DISUNITY IMPERILS FRENCH PROPOSAL FOR BOSNIA FORCE
France's effort to get its allies to join in using military force to stop further Serbian attacks on Muslim enclaves in Bosnia is foundering on British reluctance to go to war there and American hesitancy in the face of European division, American and European officials said today.
One French official described the round of diplomatic and military consultations held since President Jacques Chirac made his proposal for tougher action last week as "a failure" so far.

Bill Richardson crossed his legs, and Saddam Hussein walked out of the room.
The Congressman from New Mexico had unwittingly insulted the Iraqi President with his body language.
He had shown his sole, an offensive gesture in some Arab cultures, and started off his negotiations to free two jailed Americans in Baghdad on the wrong foot.
"The vibes didn't connect early on," Mr.
Richardson said today in an interview from Amman, Jordan.
But the Iraqi leader soon returned, and "at the end he was starting to smile. It ended up being a warm meeting."

School Chief In Newark Is 'Appalled' At Problems
Dr.
Beverly L. Hall started her first day as the state-appointed Superintendent for the troubled Newark school district by inspecting three schools today.
She said she found conditions worse than she had ever experienced during 25 years as a teacher and administrator in New York City.
"I was really appalled by what I saw," said Dr.
Hall, who stepped down as the No. 2 administrator in the New York City system to take the post of acting superintendent here for at least one year.
"I have run schools in districts that are very similar to the districts in Newark. Never would you see the conditions that I saw today."

He also asserted that his efforts won back the Senate for the Democrats in 1986 and were instrumental in putting Bill Clinton in the White House six years later.

Haight Street as Memory Lane
IT is probably safe to say that Haight-Ashbury in the 60's (for Windows and Macintosh, about $30) is the first multimedia production to come packaged in its own "collectible stash box." It is also safe to say that excerpts will not appear in a William Bennett CD-ROM of Virtues.
In the 1960's, the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco was the antithesis of everything the establishment saw as virtuous.
The heads in the Haight promoted sex, drugs, rock music and a libertinism that outsiders saw as threatening the very foundations of society but that insiders deemed the pathway to a higher consciousness.

Paternity Tests Unsully Wild Reputation of Faithful Gray Seal
HOW fitting that in the 1990's -- when "family values" is no longer a buzzword but a mandate, and adolescents march on Washington to publicly pronounce that they will remain virgins until marriage, and bitter terms like "shame" and "illegitimacy" have been retrieved from their Victorian tin and given broad airing -- biologists have discovered evidence of animal fidelity where they least expected it.
By all predictions, the gray seal, found throughout the North Atlantic, should be a classically polygynous mammal, a species founded on the principle of a harem.
Males haul themselves up onto breeding beaches where females abound and fight viciously to form a dominance hierarchy, the biggest, nastiest sandkickers monopolizing the greatest number of females.
Though under constant threat of overthrow by lesser bulls, the alpha males presumably get their payoff in siring the most pups.

As his characters bounce from Sri Lanka to Monte Carlo, Johannesburg to Palestine, they leave behind carnage and deadpan wisecracks.

Despite the delay, the admission is welcome.

Lands' End makes a midsummer foray into marketing.
CHRISTMAS in July?
In this heat, not a chance.
Yet it's beginning to look a lot like a certain day in December as Lands' End Inc., the mail-order catalogue giant, undertakes its first midsummer campaign and its largest devoted to a single theme.
This effort from Lands' End, which begins this week, peddles a redesigned version of the company's popular mesh knit polo shirt.
In the multimedia campaign, which includes an initial foray onto the Internet, the many changes being made -- from stronger buttons to a softer feel described in adspeak as "more cottony" -- are promoted as embodiments of the Lands' End philosophy that "we just couldn't leave well enough alone."

Restoring Ebbing Hormones May Slow Aging
WHY do some people in their 80's look, act and feel vigorous and energetic while others need help just to get through the chores of daily living?
A good part of the answer may lie in their hormones.
If studies now under way bear out their initial promise, hormone treatments for people over 60 may help to turn back the clock and, though without extending life, greatly enhance its quality.
Researchers are exploring the rejuvenating effects of several hormones that are known to undergo rather striking declines with age.
These include, but go beyond, replacing estrogen, which declines sharply in women after menopause.
The safety of estrogen replacement, particularly with regard to the risk of breast cancer, is hotly debated and raises a cautionary note about the wisdom of replacing other hormones that fall with age.

A Pathmark for Queens
In East Harlem, neighborhood associations have been trying for 25 years to establish a Pathmark supermarket with the help of tax breaks and a contribution of city land.

Now, in Queens, another Pathmark drama is unfolding, without the racial overtones and the complications of public-sector involvement.
Pathmark wants to build a store in Springfield Gardens, where people have to travel to Long Island's Nassau County for decent grocery shopping.

The Jets signed Kyle Brady, their first choice in April's National Football League draft, to a four-year contract worth $5.035 million today.

Brady, from Penn State, was the ninth choice over all in the draft.
He was a surprising selection for a team that was not looking for a tight end and could have filled a need by taking J. J. Stokes, the U.C.L.A. wide receiver, or Warren Sapp, the Miami defensive tackle.

The deal would make Kimberly-Clark a consumer-products giant, broadening its domestic-products line and opening the door to European expansion in competition with Procter &amp; Gamble.
The merged company would have annual revenue of $11 billion, second only to Procter, which has $30 billion, and which indicated that it would raise antitrust objections both in the United States and in Europe.

The Risk Of U.S. Inaction
The Bosnian Serbs are fairly prudent.
They have launched no attacks without first trying to gauge the American and allied response.
When they find weakness, they press forward; when they meet resistance, they stop and wait.

Then they watched to see when the new European rapid-reaction force would become operational.
When it became clear that Europe was moving slowly and that the force might not be very potent, they moved on Srebrenica and now Zepa.

At the time Seles was attacked, she was ranked No. 1 ahead of Graf, who said 10 days ago after winning Wimbledon that she was fully in favor of sharing her ranking with Seles for the remainder of 1995.
"It's obvious that the tour needs her, and hopefully she's ready to need tennis again," Graf said.

Brutality Suit Filed Against Police Officer
The widow of a security guard who died in a confrontation with a New York City police officer last December has filed a $48 million lawsuit against the officer, his colleagues, and the city.
The lawsuit against Officer Francis X.

Bosnia Threatens U.N. Troops Unless NATO Jets Aid Defense
Bosnian Government troops defending the beleaguered enclave of Zepa said today that unless NATO warplanes flew to Zepa's aid they would use Ukrainian troops in the United Nations peacekeeping force as human shields against the advancing forces of the Bosnian Serbs.
The ultimatum presented the Western allies with one of the most difficult dilemmas in the Bosnian war: The Bosnian Serbs have already warned that at the first sight of NATO aircraft, they would kill eight peacekeeping soldiers they took captive in their assault on the enclave and target the 79 other Ukainians inside Zepa.

On Therapy And a Novel Called 'Therapy'
"Writing is a form of therapy," said Graham Greene, a quotation that David Lodge uses as an epigraph to his new novel, which, naturally, is called "Therapy." Mr.
Lodge said that as a novelist he "converts negative experience into something positive," and added about "Therapy," "I certainly feel better having written it." At the same time, he made it clear that a novel must "transcend the limits of a writer's own experience."
Then, to lighten the conversation, he quoted J. P. Donleavy: "Writing is a way of turning the unhappiest moments of your life into money," a statement that would be more applicable to Martin Amis than to David Lodge, whose career has been gradually ascending and paralleled by his own industrious work as a university professor.


Democrats Force the G.O.P. To Pull Anti-Regulation Bill

Prosecutors charged yesterday that two Bronx police officers let a couple of robbery suspects go free, apparently because the officers were too lazy to carry out the arrests, and that they then lied to a grand jury about the incident.
Prosecutors said it appeared that the officers, James Martin and Daniel Campbell, who were charged with perjury in an indictment yesterday, did not want to go through the lengthy hassle of booking the suspects on robbery charges.
Instead, investigators charge, they simply told the men to return the property to the victims and go home, and even gave the two suspects a lift to their homes in a patrol car.


Use of N.R.A. Is Criticized In Raid Case
In a letter that hinted at a rift in the ranks of Republicans on the eve of hearings about a Federal raid outside Waco, Tex., the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said today that he was "outraged" that a National Rifle Association consultant misrepresented herself as a member of the committee staff to a potential witness.
Representative Henry J. Hyde, a Republican of Illinois, criticized the incident brought to light on Sunday by Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat of Brooklyn.
The witness, a social worker from Texas, was subpoenaed after she was interviewed by a consultant for the rifle association who identified herself as a member of the "Waco hearing team."

Julius Cohen, 81; Jewelry Designer Who Won Awards
Julius Cohen, a jewelry designer and the owner of the Madison Avenue shop and studio that bears his name, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan.
He was 81.
The cause was cancer, said his wife, Margo Feiden.


Growing Power of Jerusalem's Ultra-Orthodox Makes Other Jews Uneasy
In ever-embattled Jerusalem, Jews of different religious convictions are locked in a struggle over whose vision for the holy city will prevail.
Jews who define themselves as secular or modern Orthodox are increasingly at odds with fiercely traditional Orthodox Jews, known here as haredim and widely identified by their black suits and hats and modest dresses.


Personal Health
IN the 10 years since genetic engineering made it possible to synthesize large quantities of human growth hormone, endocrinologists have learned a great deal about what it can -- and cannot -- do.
Until so-called recombinant human growth hormone, or rhGH, was developed, so little of the natural hormone was available that only children with severe hormone deficiency could be treated.


Twist a Dial and Cab Fare Soars, Police Say
Thousands of people who rode taxis in New York City in recent months may have noticed that the drivers fiddled a lot with their CB radios.
What they didn't notice, the police said yesterday, was that sometimes as the radios got louder, the fares got higher.
The police arrested Mohammad I. Ahmed, a cab driver, yesterday and said they believe that in the last six months, he has rigged the meters in at least 500 yellow cabs, including his own, to overcharge passengers.


Sports of The Times; Finally, New Talent In Jersey
AS the head basketball coach for Cheyney State from 1971 to 1983, C. Vivian Stringer used to regularly take Rutgers apart on the court.
Now, 12 years later, she's attempting to lift the program to a higher level.
If the past is any indication, Stringer will achieve that level and finally lift the school from its athletic doldrums.
Unfortunately, in the five days since Stringer was introduced as the Rutgers coach, her hiring has been clouded by wrong-headed analysis that focused on salary and race rather than merit.
Stringer makes more than the school's football coach, the stories point out.
It didn't hurt, said others, that she was African-American and joining a university that was rocked by racial tension earlier this year.


Revolution in Treating Infertile Men Turns Hopelessness to Parenthood
ADVANCES in treating male infertility have made it possible for virtually any man who makes even the tiniest amount of sperm to become a father.
Even men who have no sperm at all or only dead sperm in their ejaculate or men whose sperm cannot swim or cannot penetrate an egg may be helped.
The most recent discovery builds on the finding that men who have no viable sperm in their semen often have at least a small number in their testes.
These sperm are unable to fertilize eggs on their own because they have not undergone maturation and biochemical changes that occur when sperm are transported from the testes through the epididymis, a coiled tube where sperm are stored.
They are barely moving because motility also develops during the passage through the epididymis.
But they can still fertilize an egg when they are directly injected into it.


OLYMPICS: One Year to Atlanta 1996; A Lot of Optimism But Hurdles to Leap
Exactly one year from the opening of the centennial Summer Olympic Games, the temperature is rising into the high 90's, dormitories at the athletes' village are sinking from unexpected settling and the financial forecast remains as hazy as a humid July morning.
If Billy Payne, the chief organizer, is sweating, however, it doesn't show.
He has promised the biggest and best Olympics ever, and he expects to deliver.
A year out, the track is being installed at Olympic Stadium, ticket sales have exceeded expectations, 5,000 athletes have begun arriving for pre-Olympic competitions and the economic impact of the Games has been projected at $5.1 billion.


I.B.M. Quarterly Earnings Double as Stock Falls 25¦
Continuing its strong turnaround, the I.B.M.
Corporation reported yesterday that earnings more than doubled in the second quarter from a year earlier, surpassing the highest forecasts made by Wall Street analysts.
But the results apparently did not impress investors, who drove down International Business Machines shares sharply in early trading.
The stock closed at $107 in heavy trading, down 25 cents on the New York Stock Exchange, on a day that the Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.01 points.


Fire at a Substation Closes 2 PATH Lines
A fire in a PATH train substation in lower Manhattan yesterday morning knocked out power to two lines, trapped three trains under the Hudson River for at least 90 minutes and disrupted the trips of thousands of commuters who use the service to shuttle between New Jersey and Manhattan.
The fire caused sufficient damage to the substation's power cables that officials could not say if service would resume today on the lines, between Hoboken Station and the 33d Street Station, at Herald Square, and between Journal Square Station in Jersey City and the 33d Street Station.
The interruption added to the general confusion of commuters to Manhattan who, in recent days, have also had to be concerned with a potential strike by the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.

Yankees Go 0 for 2 Against Ex-Yanks
The Yankees had to be thankful that yesterday's doubleheader was not a tripleheader.
Otherwise Don Larsen might have pitched the third game against his former teammates.
What happened to New York was devastating enough.
Jim Abbott and Dave Righetti, the only pitchers to throw nine-inning no-hitters for the Yankees since Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, returned to Yankee Stadium yesterday.
Each was a winner as they led the Chicago White Sox to a 9-4 and 11-4 sweep that featured a combined total of 61 hits by the two teams -- and one insult by a Yankee pitcher that will surely not be forgotten anytime soon.


Volkswagen campaign presents driving as a metaphor for life.
UNTIL now, most efforts by Volkswagen A.G. to rebuild its reputation in North America by stressing the German engineering of its automobiles have failed faster than you can say "Fahrvergnugen." Now the company's United States and Canadian marketing unit is pinning its hopes on ambitious, almost audacious advertising -- the first from its new agency -- that seeks to present driving as a metaphor for life.
In an aggressive campaign that begins tomorrow, Arnold Fortuna Lawner &amp; Cabot in Boston tries to transform a phrase borrowed from classified advertisements, "Drivers wanted," into an assertive anthem.
The ads mock manifestations of modern technology like the Internet and high-tech offices with sealed windows as a way to chide rival automobiles as confining and soul-deadening.
The goal is to attract car buyers to join a kind of exclusive club of free-wheeling, fun-loving enthusiasts who take a stick-shift perspective in a world overrun by automatic transmissions.


To Our Readers
The Times has revised its tables of company earnings to accommodate the quarterly financial results of more companies more promptly.
To increase the number of quarterly reports, the tables will omit cumulative sixth-month and nine-month results, which include historical data already reported.
In a company's fourth quarter, the tables will continue to list the annual financial results.


White House Seeks to Halt Bosnia Bill
Administration officials scrambled today to head off Senate legislation they feared would force United Nations peacekeepers out of Bosnia and imperil their efforts to forge a new plan with the allies to stop Serbian aggression.
The bill would require the United States to break with the United Nations embargo against arming the Muslim-led Bosnian Government under certain circumstances.
But in a last-minute addition to ease some Democratic concerns, it would give the President leeway to delay carrying it out.


Sperm Bank Is Ordered Closed And Denied a License Hearing
The largest sperm bank in New York State was ordered yesterday to close its doors by next Tuesday, after a State Supreme Court justice found that the State Department of Health was justified in refusing to license the company.
The bank's owner, the Daxor Corporation, and its president, Dr.
Joseph Feldschuh, had gone to court to try to force the Health Department to conduct a hearing on its application to operate blood banks, tissue banks, clinical laboratories and semen banks in New York City.


International Briefs; Revamping by Sony Shifts Some Production
The Sony Corporation is shifting part of its electronic components' production overseas in a restructuring prompted by the strong yen.
It even plans to move part of the operation of its Tokyo headquarters overseas, the executive deputy president, Tamotsu Iba, said yesterday.


Earnings Dip at Citicorp; Chemical Has Jump of 27%
Buoyed by trading and its strong business in developing countries, Citicorp said yesterday that revenues surged 16 percent in the second quarter but that profits slipped 3 percent from a year earlier, when it benefited from a $200 million tax break.
At the Chemical Banking Corporation, in contrast, revenues were flat, but profits jumped 27 percent, to $453 million, mainly from securities gains and cost-cutting.


International Briefs; Hyundai in Vietnam
The Hyundai Motor Company said yesterday that it had formed a $200 million joint venture to assemble cars in Vietnam.
The venture with Vietnam's Corporation 990 Trading and Services will initially assemble 20,000 Hyundai cars a year.
Production is scheduled to begin next year, a Hyundai spokesman said.
Hyundai Motor will cover 65 percent of the venture's start-up costs, he said.
The Hyundai conglomerate of South Korea also makes ships, home electronics and semiconductors. (AP)


TIME WARNER INC. (TWX)
Time Warner Inc. posted a loss yesterday for the second quarter but said that it was narrower than the loss in the corresponding period a year earlier.
The loss shrank to $8 million, or 3 cents a share, from $20 million, or 6 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
The per-share figures reflect the payment of preferred dividends.


Italian Rider Dies After High-Speed Crash
Fabio Casartelli, a 24-year-old Italian bicycle racer who was the reigning Olympic road race champion, was killed in the Tour de France today when he crashed on a steep and sinuous descent in the mountains and fractured his skull.
While Casartelli was being flown by helicopter to a hospital in Tarbes, his heart stopped three times.
He was revived by doctors aboard the craft after the first two attacks, but they were unsuccessful after the third and he could not be helped at the hospital either.

Deck Collapses Under Revelers
One woman was in the intensive care unit at Atlantic City Memorial Hospital and six others remained hospitalized yesterday after being injured when a deck collapsed at a summer home during a party.
An unknown number of guests, most of them in their 20's, were on the second-floor deck Monday night when it gave way, sending them 20 feet to the ground.
Sgt.
Al Gomber of the Avalon police said 25 people were treated in hospitals.


Faldo Blends In Among the Bunkers
Nick Faldo is padding about the home of golf these days as though it is his home, as though the old stone clubhouse is his castle and the Old Course his private province.
There is good reason for this.
Faldo, who turned 38 today, has been away for a while, over in the colonies honing his game for the past six months.
Now he is back, very much on his own turf and his own terms, back to the place where five years ago this week he effectively, if temporarily, silenced his critics and stated his case as the master of the majors.


Mets and Orioles Talking About a Deal for Bonilla
The Mets are playing their best ball of the season, and Bobby Bonilla has been at the center of it as the club's only .300 hitter and most consistent player.
But there's a chance Bonilla could join the Baltimore Orioles if the teams can reach an agreement on a trade before the non-waiver deadline of July 31.
The Orioles, in contention in the American League East, need a power hitter and are seeking the switch-hitting Bonilla in exchange for outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds.
The Mets also want the right-handed relief pitcher Armando Benitez.


We Paid a Terrible Price for Atom Bomb
To the Editor:
Richard Rhodes is no doubt correct in stating that the emergence of nuclear weapons 50 years ago "changed the conditions" for global war ("Echoes of the Big Bang," Op-Ed, July 15).
But we can't agree with his view of the bomb's enormous value as a peacemaker, past and future.
And Rhodes also ignores the terrible price we paid for embracing the bomb following the Trinity test.

U.S. Success Still Doesn't Bring Job Security for Interim Coach
Although the United States has convinced the world of its international soccer prowess this summer, Steve Sampson has not yet convinced officials that he deserves to be the permanent coach of the national team.
Sampson is making a great case for his elevation from interim status at the South American championships, or America Cup, where the United States has scored impressive victories over Mexico, Argentina and Chile.
Tomorrow, in the tournament's semifinals in Uruguay, the Americans will play Brazil, which defeated the United States, 1-0, in the second round of the 1994 World Cup.

Kodak Net Falls Short of Expectations
The Eastman Kodak Company reported a 42 percent increase in second-quarter earnings yesterday, but the results fell below the expectations of investors and analysts, pushing the stock price down sharply.
A flood of sell orders delayed the opening of trading in the stock.
By the end of the day on the New York Stock Exchange, Kodak's shares were down $3.75, or 5.4 percent, at $58.875.


Crab Meets Fresh Corn
THERE is nothing in the seafood world I await as eagerly as the appearance of soft-shell crab.
A close second is local corn, and no opportunity to combine the two is ever passed up.
Here they appear together with mangoes, which have been especially plentiful and sweet this year (the ones with a slight firmness and acidity are the best).

Richmond Council Endorses Statue Of Arthur Ashe
After a month of debate and an emotional hearing, the City Council voted early today to erect a statue of Arthur Ashe among the memorials to Confederate heroes on Monument Avenue, the city's grandest boulevard.
The unanimous decision came at 1 A.M., after the seven-hour televised hearing.
Some speakers said the statue of Mr.
Ashe, the black tennis pioneer who died in 1993, belonged on Monument Avenue beside the heroes of Virginia.
Others said it was insulting to Mr.
Ashe's memory to put a statue of him on the same street as Confederate memorials.


Whales and Boys in Risky Environments
Happy whale families might as well be all alike, at least in movies.
But unhappy whale families have the makings of an orca-size hit, one that is far more engaging than any pithy plot summary suggests.
To call "Free Willy" the heartwarming story of a boy and his pet orca might be accurate, but it would miss the savviness and rousing spirit of the 1993 film, in which Jesse, an abandoned 12-year-old, helps Willy escape a sideshow and head back to his mother.
"Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home," can't even be summarized in a pithy way.
Here Jesse learns that he has a half-brother, runs across Willy again and becomes a hero after an environmental disaster.
As strained and overloaded as it sounds, "Free Willy 2" is an even smarter and more endearing tale of family reconciliation than the original.
The film is sweet and sentimental but also fast and full of action, and shrewdly realistic about sibling hostility.
In a season crammed with films fighting for children's attention, "Free Willy 2" may be the ideal family movie.


In Hamptons, Lines in the Sand Ignite Tempers; Oceanfront Residents Try to Restrict Public Access to Beaches
From the edge of his beach towel on the sugar-soft sand of Fowler's Beach, Joseph Obermayer can see the rise of newly built ocean estates, which he scornfully derides as potato mansions inhabited by the territorial nouveau riche.
From the edge of eight-foot-high privet hedges bordering his oceanfront development on the old Henry Ford estate, Joern Brunvall can see Fowler's Beach bathers like Mr.
Obermayer, gauche summer tourists who litter country roads with beer bottles and lines of unsightly cars.


Smoking Lures Women in Japan
A BRIDE in a white wedding robe bolts out in the middle of the ceremony.
The groom runs after her as she drives away on a motorcycle.
In the next scene, another woman in jeans and a T-shirt is shown laughing as she dumps a guitar and some clothing on a young man.
The 15-second commercial for Virginia Slims, shot to the music of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Want to Have Fun," carries the slogan "Be you." Tobacco commercials like this one, made in the United States, are aired in Japan and, some critics say, are helping to nurture a rapidly growing market among women for cigarettes.

Ewing Answers Critics Of His Labor Stance
Patrick Ewing, the Knicks' All-Star center, who is part of a group of select players trying to decertify the National Basketball Players Association, criticized his detractors yesterday during an informal news conference at City Hall.
Ewing, who along with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani kicked off the Hoop It Up 1995 World Tour on the steps of City Hall, said he was tired of hearing that a select group of agents are behind part of the league's unsettled labor problems.

Food Notes
Changes at Greenberg Desserts
William Greenberg Jr.
Desserts, a company that was founded by Mr.
Greenberg in 1946 and has long been known for its simple dark chocolate cakes, rich brownies and butter cookies, has been sold.
The company, which now has three stores and its own kosher bakery, was bought by Stephen Fass, who was a food buyer for Bloomingdale's and Macy's; Maria Marfuggi, who was in the cheese business, and Willa Abramson, who has mail-order experience.
Mr. Fass will be the president of the new company, which will keep the Greenberg name.


Heat's Deadly Toll Rises in Chicago


Investment Counselor Is Arrested
The former owner of two investment companies in Princeton was arrested yesterday in North Carolina and charged with defrauding investors in California by giving them false information.
The charge against Chuckles Kohli involves a loss of about $227,000, The Associated Press reported, but in court documents, the Federal Bureau of Investigation accuses him of bilking investors of $40 million through his companies, Sigma Inc., and the Savid Group.
Federal prosecutors said they hope to have Mr.
Kohli returned to New Jersey to face a grand jury.


2 Israeli Hikers Shot to Death In West Bank
Two Israeli hikers were shot to death today in a scenic West Bank canyon between Jerusalem and Jericho in an attack the army said was carried out by Palestinian militants.
An army spokesman said the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine had taken responsibility, and Israel Radio reported that graffiti signed by the group were found at the scene.
The front, a radical leftist movement, opposes the self-rule accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.

Reviewing the Waco Raid
A heavy burden rests on the two House subcommittees that begin hearings today into the deadly 1993 Federal raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex.
The hearings ought to look at the tragic blunders of the raiders from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and investigate the performance of their leaders at the Treasury and Justice Departments.
The hearings must not be allowed to degenerate into fodder for the militia fantasists and those who want to make David Koresh, the Davidian leader who died in the raid, into a gun-ownership martyr.
The House hearings will rehearse known mistakes.
They also have the potential to expose new ones.
But their main task ought to be finding ways to improve Justice Department oversight of the F.B.I. and to reform the A.T.F.

Exactly one year from the opening of the centennial Summer Olympic Games, the temperature is rising into the high 90's, dormitories at the athletes' village are sinking from unexpected settling and the financial forecast remains as hazy as a humid July morning.

Turnpike Contract Talks Dissolve Into Name-Calling
A day after assuring a State Superior Court judge of their willingness to continue labor negotiations, the two sides in the New Jersey Turnpike's labor dispute reverted to name-calling today and bargaining fell apart.
The sudden hostilities dashed any good will established yesterday in Judge J. Norris Harding's courtroom here and appeared to doom prospects for a quick end to the contract dispute between the turnpike and its 1,500 toll collectors and maintenance workers.

The fire caused sufficient damage to the substation's power cables that officials could not say if service would resume today on the lines, between Hoboken Station and the 33d Street Station, at Herald Square, and between Journal Square Station in Jersey City and the 33d Street Station.
The interruption added to the general confusion of commuters to Manhattan who, in recent days, have also had to be concerned with a potential strike by the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.

Some New Rhythms in a Musical Merger
When the Salsa Meets Jazz concert series closed down in 1993, the city lost one of its best parties.
Matching great Latin dance bands with jazz improvisers was a brilliant idea, and the concerts often produced thrilling music that was never repeated.
Since then, there have been several efforts to re-start the series, the most recent on Monday night at the former Club Broadway (at 95th Street), now refurbished and called Latin Quarter.
For this show, the Fort Apache Band played host to the formidable saxophonist Arthur Blythe.
It was a good match: Fort Apache has a chunky, rocking sound that's based on the triangle of Jerry Gonzalez on congas and trumpet, Andy Gonzalez on bass and Steve Berrios on trap drums.
Mr.
Blythe has a chilly, intense sound that in the upper register can slice through percussion; it drips with passion.


In House, Spending Bills Open Way to Make Policy
House Republicans took the unusual step today of using a spending bill to make policy, approving an appropriations measure that would revoke or substantially restrict nearly 20 environmental laws that have become anathema to big business.
The action was but one skirmish in a multifront budget battle in the House of Representatives and in committee, as House Republicans worked furiously to finish their 13 appropriations bills before the scheduled August recess.

U.S. Appeals Panel Questions 6 Counts Against Rostenkowski
In a significant legal victory for Dan Rostenkowski, the former Chicago Congressman who is under indictment, a Federal appeals court today ordered a trial judge to reconsider whether 6 of the 17 corruption charges against Mr.

Although the ruling from the three-judge appeals panel did not order the outright dismissal of the charges, it appears almost certain that at least four will be thrown out.

AFTER DECADE, CHILD-ABUSE CASE LIVES ON
In 1984, five men, including a Methodist minister, were sent to prison for raping and sodomizing more than a dozen preschoolers in the Bronx.

The remaining man, the minister, is still in prison and is pressing his appeal in a case that provides a window for examining the dramatic changes in standards for investigating sexual abuse involving very young children.  [ Page A1. ] NEW YORK CITY


Predictions Of Deja Vu By Bochco
No show on television next fall will look more like the O. J. Simpson trial than ABC's forthcoming drama "Murder One." It will even have one of Mr.
Simpson's former lawyers, Howard Weitzman, making regular appearances as himself.
But Steven Bochco, the show's creator and executive producer, said at a news conference here today that the Simpson trial was not the inspiration for the new drama, which will trace the complications of a single murder trial for 23 episodes.
Rather, he said, he got the idea from his "L.A. Law," in which "complicated cases had to be boiled down to two or three episdoes."


Early Questions Reported on Top F.B.I. Aide
A top official at the Justice Department said today that she had raised questions about Larry A. Potts, the former Deputy F.B.I.

Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick said today that she and Attorney General Janet Reno began discussions in early June with the Director, Louis J. Freeh, about whether Mr.
Potts, Mr.
Freeh's friend and associate, could operate effectively as the No. 2 official at the bureau.
"There were discussions among us," Ms.
Gorelick said today.

High-Speed Ferry Service To Begin Across the Sound
The Foxwoods Casino on the Mashantucket Pequot Indian reservation near New London, Conn., thinks it has a sure bet: promoting the launching of the first high-speed ferry service across Long Island Sound.

Foreign Affairs; Muffled Militants
During a visit to Turkey in May I met with a columnist for a leading Ankara newspaper and asked him in passing how circulation was.
"Great," he told me.
It was growing daily.
What was their trick?
I asked.
More sports?
Doonesbury?
Ann Landers?
No, no, he said, it's very simple.
"We are giving away commentaries on the Koran with every new subscription."
Not only in Turkey, where the Mayors of Ankara and Istanbul come from the Islamic party, but elsewhere in the Middle East, Islamic fundamentalism seems to be either going underground or going mainstream.
That is, fundamentalist groups are either engaging in more hard-core violence, and losing to the secular authorities, or playing by the rules of the game and being co-opted by the secular political systems.
But whether their approach is the M-16 or MTV, Islamic fundamentalists no longer seem quite so threatening, their power no longer quite so invincible, their victory march no longer quite so inevitable.
Indeed, for the moment -- and it may only be a moment -- the Islamic fundamentalist phenomenon has peaked.


Two Unions Reinstated at the Javits Center
Two unions that previously represented employees at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center were authorized yesterday to return as collective-bargaining agents under new agreements with the center.
An arbitrator, Daniel G. Collins, ruled that the carpenters' union and the teamsters' union had won recognition rights, but that a third union representing exposition workers had been dropped.
State officials who have reorganized the hiring system at the center have asserted that officials in the three unions previously doled out many jobs to organized-crime members and ex-convicts.


Huizenga May Move Panthers
The billionaire H. WAYNE HUIZENGA, complaining about million-dollar losses with his Florida Panthers, said yesterday that he may move the team.
He said negotiations to build an arena in Broward County have collapsed.
A decision to relocate would come in three months unless someone comes forward to build a south Florida arena and, he said at a news conference, "I have my doubts that will happen."


Why the Wedding Is Off
A day after frenzied media speculation over what could have come between Lieut.
Gov.
Betsy McCaughey and her fiance, an investment banker, Ms.
McCaughey gave her answer yesterday: Wilbur L. Ross Jr. could not get a divorce before their Sept. 15 wedding day.
"My announcement yesterday that Wilbur Ross and I are no longer engaged to be married has provoked speculation," Ms.
McCaughey, 46, said in a statement.
"I made that announcement because he is not yet divorced. Although his divorce is in its final stages, it is not yet complete. Therefore I cannot plan for the future."


Regents Prepare for Storm on Affirmative Action
With an agenda of hotly contested proposals to eliminate affirmative-action policies at the University of California, the meeting of the university's governing board on Thursday will be a proving ground for a central social issue of the decade.
Gov.
Pete Wilson, using the dismantling of affirmative action as a cornerstone of his Republican Presidential bid, has announced he will exercise his right for the first time in years to preside over the meeting.
Jesse Jackson is coming to town on Wednesday to lead protests.
And the White House has announced that President Clinton will deliver an important address on the subject on Wednesday.
The 26 regents themselves appear to be sharply divided.

DEAR DIARY:
It's petition-gathering time, and I'm collecting signatures for my populist challenger candidate for the City Council seat.
My first stop is an apartment that reveals a not uncommon Flatbush scene: mother, father and visiting daughter at the dinner table.
The father lets me in and asks my business.
"I'm collecting petition signatures for the City Council," I reply, "and your wife's an enrolled Democrat."


Westinghouse Offer for CBS Believed Near
CBS's stock jumped $1.25 yesterday to close at $71, as investors bet heavily that the Westinghouse Electric Company could arrange the financing for a $5 billion bid for the media giant.
One person with knowledge of the discussions said an offer might come within the next week and that the Westinghouse board was solidly behind its chairman, Michael H. Jordan, in favoring an acquisition of CBS.
A key question is whether Westinghouse, which is already heavily leveraged, can borrow the money for the purchase.
One executive close to the negotiations said yesterday that Westinghouse's bankers in the deal, J. P. Morgan and Chemical Bank, were optimistic.

Berlusconi May Sell Some TV Holdings, Yet Maintain Control
Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate turned politician, has reached a complex agreement to sell more than half of his television business to banks and private investors, bankers and others familiar with the negotiations said today.
The deal, which is expected to be announced soon, would produce the equivalent of $2.2 billion for Mr.
Berlusconi's corporate empire, Fininvest, while allowing him to maintain management control of his television interests -- more than 40 percent of the Italian airwaves.
It is further intended to raise capital for television expansion.

From the edge of his beach towel on the sugar-soft sand of Fowler's Beach, Joseph Obermayer can see the rise of newly built ocean estates, which he scornfully derides as potato mansions inhabited by the territorial nouveau riche.
From the edge of eight-foot-high privet hedges bordering his oceanfront development on the old Henry Ford estate, Joern Brunvall can see Fowler's Beach bathers like Mr.
Obermayer, gauche summer tourists who litter country roads with beer bottles and lines of unsightly cars.


CHRONICLE
The surprise party in honor of FLO KENNEDY, a lawyer long in the forefront of civil rights and feminist causes, was a gathering of the clan, her immediate family and her spiritual one.
Three of Ms.
Kennedy's four sisters, GRAYCE KENNEDY BAYLES, JOY KENNEDY BANKS and FAYE KENNEDY, went to the celebration on Monday in the apartment of Judge EMILY JANE GOODMAN of New York State Supreme Court for their first reunion since since 1986.
Faye Kennedy lives in Hawaii, so it is difficult for them to get together.
The other sister, Evelyn Kennedy Woods, was not able to attend.


I.R.S. Is Preparing a Tough Audit For Groups of Unwary Taxpayers
Claimed you were married on that tax return you filed in April, did you?
Well, the Internal Revenue Service may come by your house demanding to see your marriage license.
And those two children you listed as deductions?
Better have birth certificates to prove when they were born and report cards to show they go to a school close enough to live with you.
Otherwise, kiss those deductions good-bye.
That is the kind of rigorous grilling that a few hundred thousand unlucky taxpayers can expect starting this fall.
They will be selected not because they are suspected of cheating but because the I.R.S. wants to know how accurately individual taxpayers fill out their forms.

Investment Counselor Is Arrested
The former owner of two investment companies in Princeton was arrested yesterday in North Carolina and charged with defrauding investors in California by giving them false information.
The charge against Chuckles Kohli involves a loss of about $227,000, The Associated Press reported, but in court documents, the Federal Bureau of Investigation accuses him of bilking investors of $40 million through his companies, Sigma Inc., and the Savid Group.
Federal prosecutors said they hope to have Mr.
Kohli returned to New Jersey to face a grand jury.

Rain Floods Roads and Rails, and Breaks a Record
Record-breaking rains, pelting from lowering skies creased with jagged veins of lightning and booming with thunder, surged across the metropolitan area into the early hours yesterday, wreaking random havoc with transportation and leaving a summer-sodden populace no cooler than before.
The ill wind blew so little good that even the city's reservoirs could not be expected to slake their thirst for fresh runoff and raise their levels from their current subnormal content, officials said.


U.S. Success Still Doesn't Bring Job Security for Interim Coach
Although the United States has convinced the world of its international soccer prowess this summer, Steve Sampson has not yet convinced officials that he deserves to be the permanent coach of the national team.
Sampson is making a great case for his elevation from interim status at the South American championships, or America Cup, where the United States has scored impressive victories over Mexico, Argentina and Chile.
Tomorrow, in the tournament's semifinals in Uruguay, the Americans will play Brazil, which defeated the United States, 1-0, in the second round of the 1994 World Cup.

Faldo Blends In Among the Bunkers
Nick Faldo is padding about the home of golf these days as though it is his home, as though the old stone clubhouse is his castle and the Old Course his private province.
There is good reason for this.
Faldo, who turned 38 today, has been away for a while, over in the colonies honing his game for the past six months.
Now he is back, very much on his own turf and his own terms, back to the place where five years ago this week he effectively, if temporarily, silenced his critics and stated his case as the master of the majors.


Philip Morris Profits Climb On Strong Overseas Sales
The Philip Morris Companies announced strong second-quarter earnings gains yesterday, powered by explosive growth in the company's overseas tobacco revenues, even though the recent period had been a loser from a public relations standpoint, with a costly and embarrassing product recall as well as regulatory, legal and legislative assaults.
Philip Morris said its net earnings were up 14.4 percent, to $1.41 billion, or $1.67 a share, compared with $1.23 billion, or $1.42 a share, in the corresponding period of 1994, exceeding the estimates of some analysts.

Nigerian Tragedy
Nigeria, richly endowed with oil and mineral wealth, should be one of Africa's most prosperous and successful countries.
But its curse is misrule, usually by generals.
Repressive, divisive and corrupt regimes have left Nigeria a shambles.
Now the secret trial, conviction and possible execution of some of the country's most respected political leaders threatens new domestic rancor and increased international isolation.
The present military regime, which seized power in November 1993, a few months after its predecessor had annulled democratic elections, is one of the worst Nigeria has known.
Dominated by Gen.
Sani Abacha, it has crushed elected governments at all levels, arbitrarily jailed political opponents, waged war against the Ogoni minority and driven the Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka into exile.

Safety Board Criticizes F.A.A. Over 737's Outmoded Recorders
Boeing 737's need better "black boxes" to help investigators determine why they crash, and the Federal Aviation Administration is not taking the problem seriously enough, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a letter released yesterday.
The chairman of the safety board, James E. Hall, wrote to the Federal Aviation Administrator, David R. Hinson, that another crash that could not be explained, should one occur, would "further erode public confidence in the airplane," which he said was far more important than costs.


International Briefs; Russian Menatep Bank Raises Red October Bid
Bank Menatep, one of Russia's largest banks, raised its takeover bid for the candy maker Red October while denying that the factory's location on prime downtown real estate was a factor in the bid.
The new offer of $9.50 a share values the company, which last year made a profit of $24 million, at $60 million.
Menatep officials raised their bid when shareholders said the first offer was too low.


Yesterday in Washington
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION Prospects for an overhaul of Federal affirmative action programs this year have significantly dimmed as President Clinton has decided to make only marginal changes in programs that give special help to minorities and women, while Republicans in Congress are unable to reach a consensus on how many of the programs to abolish.
WHITEWATER HEARINGS The Senate began the politically charged hearings about Whitewater and the personal finances of President Clinton and his wife, Hillary.
The first witness was Webster L. Hubbell, the former Associate Attorney General who was sentenced last month to a 21-month prison term for taking almost $500,000 from his clients and former law partners at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark.

Journal; Shotgun Hearings
What a heady time to be a Republican in Congress!
With Whitewater hearings resuming yesterday in the Senate and Waco hearings starting today in the House, the smell of blood is in the air.
All that's needed to insure the Clinton Administration's demise is the link merging Whitewater and Waco into one grand conspiracy -- and this, too, may be at hand.
The trusty Washington Times has already uncovered a previously undisclosed Vincent Foster "role" in the Waco raid; how long until jackbooted government thugs are implicated in his "murder"?
Fair-minded Americans want to get to the bottom of Whitewater and Waco, however deep.
The real question is whether the Republican Congress is up to the task.
If I had to bet on who is going to discover the whole truth about Whitewater, I wouldn't put my money on partisans like New York's favorite exemplar of ethics, Al D'Amato, or the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, but on James Stewart, the impartial reporter who is following his definitive and best-selling account of 1980's Wall Street felonies, "Den of Thieves," with his own examination of Whitewater, "Blood Sport," due from Simon &amp; Schuster in January.


Minister Loses Renomination To City Panel On the Police
Recognizing that the proposed reappointment would probably be defeated, the City Council withdrew the Rev.
Ruben Diaz's nomination to the Civilian Complaint Review Board yesterday.
But the effective result is that Mr.
Diaz, harshly criticized for what some considered anti-homosexual views, may stay on the board indefinitely as a holdover member.
Since his initial appointment two years ago, Mr.
Diaz has been the source of intense criticism from many within the Council as well as from gay groups for remarks critical of homosexuality.

What's In at Camp: Designer Water (TV, Too)
WHILE some things at summer camp may be as timeless as campfires and poison ivy, the old-fashioned "care package" -- homemade cookies and a couple of rolls of Life Savers -- has gone the way of the outhouse.
Some campers today receive miniature televisions, CD players and designer clothes in addition to the expected shipments of finger paints, stickers and candy.


Pataki Walks Fine Line on Rail Talks
In his quiet efforts to resolve the Metro-North Commuter Railroad contract dispute, Gov.
George E. Pataki is struggling to balance two conflicting mind-sets within his administration: those who want him to take a hard line against labor and those who believe he must work with the unions to avoid a disruptive strike.
To some of his advisers, the talks between Metro-North's 17 unions and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority give the Republican Governor a sterling opportunity to show that he can be tough with organized labor as part of his effort to hold down government costs.

Jurors See Tape of Simpson Working Out
Jurors at the O. J. Simpson trial today saw Mr.
Simpson work out for 45 minutes on a videotape made two weeks before the murders with which he is charged.
They also heard him make a veiled remark about striking his wife -- one that defense lawyers say was a joke but that prosecutors contend betrayed the mind of a batterer.
In an outtake from the videotape, shown by prosecutors to prove that Mr.
Simpson was not the invalid hobbled by arthritis and football injuries that his lawyers have portrayed him to be, a trainer facetiously warned Mr.
Simpson to steer clear of him as he threw some punches into the air.

MERRILL LYNCH &amp; CO. (MER,N)
Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, bolstered by rallies in the stock and bond markets, said yesterday that earnings rose 12 percent in the second quarter.
Profit at Merrill, the nation's biggest securities firm, rose as interest rates fell to 16-month lows, stocks reached record highs, underwriting of corporate stocks and bonds advanced, and mergers surged.
Earnings were $282.7 million, or $1.40 a share, up from $251.8 million, or $1.18 a share, in the 1994 quarter.


PREFERENCE PLANS MAY ESCAPE MOVE FOR MAJOR CHANGE
Prospects for a vast overhaul in Federal affirmative action programs this year have significantly dimmed with a decision by President Clinton to make only marginal changes in them, coupled with Congressional Republicans' decision to put off any effort to impose an outright ban.
After a four-month review of all Federal preference programs based on race or sex, a White House task force has concluded that they have generally worked to advance equal opportunity, according to the resulting report, a copy of which was provided by White House officials.


Two Calypso Monarchs in the Park
Super Blue summed up the mission of Trinidadian calypso at Central Park Summerstage on Sunday afternoon.
"We are informing, educating and entertaining at the same time," he announced.
Calypso watchers have long worried that the party chants of modern soca (or soul-calypso) are driving out calypso's long tradition of sophisticated wordplay and social commentary.
Sunday's concert brought something from both sides: Super Blue's jubilant, participatory soca hits and Black Stalin's buoyant message calypsos.
Super Blue, born Austin Lyons, has won Trinidad's Road March competition seven times since 1980 and has held the Soca Monarch title since it was introduced in 1993.
The winning road march is the song played most often by the mobile sound systems in the carnival parade; it's the people's choice for party music.

Brister Finds A Niche (For Now)
He was the quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers until an injury and Neil O'Donnell's younger arm knocked him out of the starting job.
He moved to the Philadelphia Eagles, where a new owner enamored of Randall Cunningham's fickle talents kept him from challenging for Cunningham's starting job.
So now Bubby Brister is a Jet, the designated backup to Boomer Esiason.
After a frustrating two years with the Eagles, he became an unrestricted free agent.
In March, he signed with the Jets for $2 million over two years.

Taking On Insurance Giants
When Ronald R. Parry, a soft-spoken lawyer from Kentucky, comes calling these days, life insurance companies look for cover.
That's because Mr.
Parry, an insurance neophyte until just two years ago, has emerged as a champion for tens of thousands of aggrieved policyholders.
For decades, life insurers were considered too big and powerful for individuals to fight.
But that is rapidly changing.
Mr.
Parry has already helped win a $43 million settlement for 18,000 customers of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which was accused of improperly selling life insurance as a retirement or savings plan.
Now, he has trained his sights on other companies.


Legislators Against the Arts
It is an astonishing day for New York when it has a better friend in Alan Simpson than in its own Congressional representatives.
The Wyoming Senator is one of three Republicans who have come up with a sensible alternative to the House's slash-and-burn approach to arts funding.
Yesterday the entire Republican side of the New York delegation voted to write the death warrant for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, approving a bill that would end all funding within two years.
It is surprising to see upstate moderates like Amo Houghton and Sherwood Boehlert joining the anti-arts swing, but it is at least understandable.
Their constituencies are not nearly as dependent on the arts as is the New York metropolitan area.
But for Susan Molinari, Michael Forbes, Peter King, Daniel Frisa and Rick Lazio, it is mind-boggling.
These Representatives are selling their constituents down the river.


Elderly Pilots, Too, Need More Stringent Testing
To the Editor:
More stringent testing of elderly drivers was recommended (July 13) because of the predicted increased number of drivers in the next 30 years.
Concern should also be raised about the growing number of elderly pilots.
Statistics show that there are 30,000 pilots in the United States over age 64, including more than 300 over 80.
In fact, flying has become so popular among the aged, an Octogenarian Flying Club has been formed.


International Briefs; Toyota Sees Low Sales Because of Rising Yen
Japan's largest auto maker, the Toyota Motor Corporation, announced yesterday that it had lowered its planned domestic production for the year.
The auto maker said the rising yen and weakening overseas markets had led it to expect lower exports, and domestic sales were slower than anticipated.
Toyota said it would cut domestic production 5.8 percent from its original plan, to 3.22 million vehicles.
The company said it had lowered projections for domestic sales by 3.1 percent, to 2.17 million, and for exports by 8.8 percent, to 1.14 million.
The company also said its production and exports in the first half of 1995 were down compared with the corresponding period in 1994, and its domestic sales had grown by only 1.2 percent, to 1.06 million vehicles. (AP)


One Precinct Takes Aim At Environmental Crime
The calls would come in regularly to the 90th Precinct in Brooklyn: mysterious oil drum on street corner; unidentified men carrying barrels of waste into and out of an abandoned warehouse; unlicensed dumping in a local lot; green smoke pouring out of factory chimney.
But collaring dangerous oil drums is not exactly a traditional way of getting ahead in the New York City Police Department.
And so the typical response from the precinct was one of sympathy, but not much else.


At the Nation's Table: Fort Worth; Offbeat Decor For Beer Hall
The Ed Bass empire already includes Biosphere 2 and Caravan of Dreams, a combination nightclub, grotto bar and geodesic-domed cactus garden in downtown Fort Worth.
Now, also in downtown Fort Worth, add the Flying Saucer Beer Emporium, a Romanesque beer hall lined with 1,500 souvenir plates.
Mr.
Bass, of the wealthy Bass family, is the landlord who approved the idea for the beer hall, cooked up by Shannon Wynne, a local restaurant owner, and then renovated an 1889 building for it.


Panel's Haunting Replay Of Official's Final Days
Suddenly, some of the cares that Vincent W. Foster Jr. left behind when he walked out of the White House and committed suicide two years ago surfaced today in a giant replica of his own tight handwriting, highlighted in luminous green on nine high-tech video screens at a Senate hearing where all eyes and lenses snapped to attention.
"Don't want to go back into that box," Mr.
Foster had jotted in his private notes about President Clinton's financial affairs.


Microsoft Speeding Its On-Line Service
Taking a step closer to a showdown with the Justice Department, the Microsoft Corporation said yesterday that not only did it plan to include access to its new on-line service in the Windows 95 operating system next month, but that the service would also be fully linked to the Internet, several months earlier than expected.
The announcements, made by the chairman of Microsoft, William H. Gates, at an industry conference in Long Beach, Calif., came on the eve of Microsoft's expected filing of a court brief challenging the Justice Department's latest request for information.


When Schools Favor Religion
To the Editor:
President Clinton is commendably concerned about public school violations of the constitutional obligation to be neutral toward religion by wrongly disfavoring religion (front page, July 13).
But you rightly call him to task in "School Prayer Anxieties" (editorial, same day) for not expressing concern about public school violations of this obligation by wrongly favoring religion.

Minority Applicants Gain on Home Loans
Black and Hispanic mortgage applicants remain much more likely than white applicants to be turned down for loans to buy homes but the gap is narrowing, a Federal interagency panel announced today.
Banks, credit unions, savings institutions and other lenders across the country turned down 33.4 percent of black mortgage applicants last year and 24.6 percent of Hispanic mortgage applicants, the panel found.
Only 16.4 percent of white applicants were rejected.

Arguments Begin in Susan Smith Trial
The prosecution urged the jurors at the Susan Smith trial to hold on to their common sense in the weeks ahead, and they would come to see Mrs.
Smith as a selfish, malicious killer who sacrificed her children for the love of the son of a rich industrialist.
The defense begged them to look into their hearts and, through that softer focus, find a disturbed, child-like figure who, after a lifetime of sadness, just snapped like a dry twig.

Council Vote Clears Way For Pathmark
Plans to build a 65,000-square-foot Pathmark supermarket in Springfield Gardens, Queens, won approval from a City Council committee yesterday, virtually assuring that the store will be built, but only after the developer agreed to donate more than $400,000 over the next 20 years to other merchants in the area.
Under the agreement, the money would be distributed to merchants who would be Pathmark's competitors and used to renovate facades, for example, and make other store improvements.
Community groups would also get money for projects like youth programs.


In South Africa, a Culture of Resistance Dies Hard
Outside the electric company's tin shack, which is barely big enough to hold two cashiers and their computers, Angelina Tshisa stood in the dust here waiting to pay her bill.

"This is killing us," she said. "We are crying in Soweto."


Book Notes
A Poet's Life
In the 1930's, Virginia H. Adair, then a precocious poet in her 20's, happily saw her verses published in Atlantic Monthly, The New Republic, The Christian Science Monitor and The Saturday Review of Literature.
But with a husband and then children, Mrs.
Adair began to shun publication, saying it was too time-consuming and restrictive.

Brian Blades, the receiver for the Seattle Seahawks, was charged today with manslaughter in the shooting death of his cousin.

He called his figures "conservative at every turn."

On the Trail of a Missing Man, in the Old Indochina
HIGHWAYS TO A WAR
By Christopher J. Koch
469 pages. Viking. $23.95.
"In April 1976," Christopher J. Koch announces in the first line of his eventful new novel, "my friend Michael Langford disappeared inside Cambodia." That was exactly one year after the Khmer Rouge marched into Phnom Penh and inaugurated one of the cruelest experiments in social engineering of our dreadful century.
Mr.
Koch, the Australian writer whose best-known book is "The Year of Living Dangerously," about foreign journalists in Indonesia, is obviously turning his considerable talents toward a more familiar locale, Indochina during and just after the Vietnam War.

Tarango Clashes on the Court
JEFF TARANGO's return to singles play yesterday was about as stormy as the match in which he defaulted at Wimbledon.
In a 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 loss to BYRON BLACK in the opening round of the $675,000 Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, Tarango clashed with the chair umpire NORM CHRYST several times, and he sat down to protest Chryst's refusal to overrule when one of his serves in the 10th game of the second set was called long.
"I was disappointed because if it's called in, we're at 5-5 and I'm back in it," said Tarango, who wound up winning the set.
"But I respect Norm and I know he doesn't have it in for me."


New York Superintendents Say Cuts Will Lead to Imbalances
Community school superintendents, faced with tough choices about how to cut millions of dollars from their budgets, said yesterday that the result of budget cuts would be a patchwork of schools with different schedules and varying class sizes.
To cut $250 million from its budget, the Board of Education voted on Monday to allow New York City school districts to increase class size in first, second and third grades to 27 students, from 25, and to shorten the hours of instruction to 26, from the current 27 1/2 a week.
Community school boards would have to endorse the changes, and the Schools Chancellor would have to approve them.


Johnson &amp; Johnson's Profits Up 18.2% in Second Quarter
Johnson &amp; Johnson, the world's largest manufacturer of health care products, said yesterday that revenues and profits had surged in the second quarter, but Eli Lilly &amp; Company and the Upjohn Company reported mixed results.
Pushed by strong sales of new products, worldwide pharmaceutical revenues rose 23.9 percent, to $1.62 billion, for Johnson &amp; Johnson, compared with $1.308 billion the year before.
Overall sales rose 21.6 percent, to $4.76 billion.
Earnings rose 18.2 percent, to $661 million, or $1.02 a share, from $559 million, or 86 cents, in the quarter a year earlier.


Strikers at Detroit Newspapers Count on Deep Labor History
Reporters and columnists here are imploring their loyal readers not to buy the newspaper, in perhaps the most poignant proof of how bitter and damaging this city's five-day-old newspaper strike has already become.
Supervisory editors at The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press have joined forces in their emptied newsrooms to publish a combined newspaper.
But six striking unions, with about 2,500 members who include drivers, pressmen, photographers, reporters and copy editors, are counting on Detroit's deep labor tradition to keep readers and advertisers away.

Brooks Brothers Departure Seen
George M. Hanley, executive vice president of Brooks Brothers and a veteran of New York City retailing, left the clothing chain yesterday, people familiar with the company said.
They said his job had been eliminated as part of the restructuring that the company's owner, Marks &amp; Spencer L.P., began last fall.
The restructuring is part of an effort by Brooks Brothers to reposition itself as a seller of more casual attire favored by younger shoppers.

Intel Earnings, Up 37%, Are Below Estimates
The Intel Corporation today reported a 37.3 percent increase in second-quarter earnings, but its results still fell a few pennies short of Wall Street's expectations.
Analysts said the semiconductor maker's earnings growth was held down by higher-than-expected costs and a greater-than-expected percentage of lower profit items.


French War Stories
There are countries in Europe where almost every village holds a repressed memory of something terrible done by one group of people to another during World War II.
In Austria, the Netherlands and elsewhere, most war crimes have been conveniently attributed to the Germans.
Nowhere has this tendency been more evident than in France, where the Government has always drawn a careful distinction between those who collaborated with the Nazis and everyone else.
President Jacques Chirac's speech on Sunday acknowledging the collective responsibility of the French state for the wartime deportation of Jews is thus startling.
For the first time, a French head of state has admitted that his country was and remains responsible for crimes committed by Frenchmen under the Vichy regime of Marshal Petain.


Italian Rider Dies After High-Speed Crash
Fabio Casartelli, a 24-year-old Italian bicycle racer who was the reigning Olympic road race champion, was killed in the Tour de France today when he crashed on a steep and sinuous descent in the mountains and fractured his skull.

She had suffered a brief illness, said Ronald A. Walter, the co-author of one of her books.


Brister Finds A Niche (For Now)
He was the quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers until an injury and Neil O'Donnell's younger arm knocked him out of the starting job.
He moved to the Philadelphia Eagles, where a new owner enamored of Randall Cunningham's fickle talents kept him from challenging for Cunningham's starting job.
So now Bubby Brister is a Jet, the designated backup to Boomer Esiason.
After a frustrating two years with the Eagles, he became an unrestricted free agent.
In March, he signed with the Jets for $2 million over two years.

Market Place; Good earnings news for airline stocks could turn out to be bad.
CONTINENTAL AIRLINES was happy to trumpet its second-quarter earnings yesterday: $102 million, its best-ever profit.
It was the first major carrier to announce results in what is expected to be a record second quarter for the industry.
But a couple of sour notes could be heard in the fanfare, for good news for the airlines can also be bad news.
One problem is that the airlines are trying to persuade Congress to extend a tax exemption of 4.3 cents a gallon on fuel beyond Oct. 1, which would be worth more than $500 million to the industry.
With strong earnings, though, politicians are not likely to give the airlines a break.

A Teen-Ager Who's Clear on Her Priorities
Alicia Silverstone makes a delectable teen queen in "Clueless," a candy-colored, brightly satirical showcase for her decidedly visual talents.
Thus far famous mostly for being famous (mostly in Aerosmith videos), Ms.
Silverstone finally gives a film performance that clicks.
As a pampered Beverly Hills clotheshorse, she's mostly a one-joke princess, but the joke happens to work.
Even if "Clueless" runs out of gas before it's over, most of it is as eye-catching and cheery as its star.
The director, Amy Heckerling, also finds herself on friendly territory with the worst Californian academic talent this side of Ridgemont High.
Surfer burnouts held center stage in that earlier comedy of Ms.
Heckerling's, but this time she has gone hilariously upscale.
Ms.
Silverstone's Cher, a heroine who along with her friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) is "named after great singers of the past who now do infomercials," uses a computer to tell her when her clothes match and doesn't even let it go at that.
"I don't rely on mirrors, so I always take Polaroids," Cher confides.


Sony and Toshiba Hint at Accord on Disk
In a possible hint of a reconciliation between rival camps, the Sony Corporation has proposed that efforts be made to achieve at least partial compatibility between two competing formats for the digital videodisk.
One idea that has been broached is to make players that can play disks recorded in both formats, much as there are now machines that can play both compact disks and the much larger laser disks, according to an official of the Toshiba Corporation, which is the leader of the camp opposed to Sony.


Orange County Financial Plan Is Devised
Orange County's financial advisers today recommended a new recovery plan designed to lift this county from bankruptcy without new taxes, but with the help of the California Legislature.
The plan calls for the county to cover some $2 billion in bankruptcy-related debts by diverting taxes -- primarily property and sales taxes -- already paid by residents.
If approved by the county's Board of Supervisors, the plan would be submitted to the Legislature in mid-August.
Under California law, such tax diversions require legislative action.

Monday night's rating fell 12 percent, to a 6.9 from a 7.8.
The average two-night rating of 6.2 is down 15 percent from 1994.

You Surely Can Die Of Lyme Disease
To the Editor:
Your report on the outbreak of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis in the Northeast ("A New Lethal Illness Carried by Ticks Is Identified," July 12) contains the astonishing assertion about Lyme disease by Federal officials that they have been unable to "document a single death out of tens of thousands of cases of Lyme." They aren't looking very hard; fatalities unequivocally attributed to Lyme disease appear in the peer-reviewed medical literature.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation said today that at least seven agents had attended annual "Good Ol' Boys Roundups" in recent years and that at least one was among the 300 law-enforcement officers who attended the gathering this year in the Tennessee mountains, where racist paraphernalia was displayed and sold.
The three-day gathering, organized by a retired agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, was attended by Federal, state and local law-enforcement officers, including agents from the firearms bureau, Government officials said.


YELTSIN DISPLAYS HIS HEALTH ON TV
Sounding hoarse but robust, President Boris N. Yeltsin appeared on television from his hospital room here tonight to prove that while he was sick, he was not as sick as the Kremlin had led people to believe by its insistence that he was fine.
Mr.
Yeltsin was flushed into public view by serious questions about the authenticity of the only photograph released of the President after he was hospitalized on July 11.
The picture, distributed by the Itar-Tass news agency last Friday, showed Mr.
Yeltsin in an Ellesse tennis shirt seated at a desk next to a table with four telephones.
It appeared identical to footage of the Russian President, wearing an Ellesse tennis shirt at a desk next to four telephones, that was filmed when he was on vacation in southern Russia last April.
Mr.
Yeltsin's press secretary said it was taken at Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow on Friday.

Details Emerge On Whitewater As Panel Starts
With a theatrical flourish and a few revelations, the Senate today began months of scheduled hearings about Whitewater and the personal finances of the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
The hearings, conducted by a special committee on Whitewater, are supposed to examine the White House's handling of papers in the office of deputy counsel Vincent W. Foster Jr. after he killed himself in a Virginia park two years ago.
In Mr.
Foster's office were personal papers of the Clintons, including files about their investment in Whitewater, a land-development venture in Arkansas.


N.C.A.A. Reduces Suspension

The Los Angeles Times announced today that it planned to cut 450 full-time positions by the end of this year, and employees in the editorial department said they were told that these cuts would include up to 160 out of 1,300 news-gathering positions.
Breaking with the newspaper's recent practice of using attrition and buyouts to cut its staff and save operating costs, the reductions announced today would include an undetermined number of outright layoffs, said Laura Morgan, director of communications for the newspaper.

2 Parisian Postwar Bohemian Poets, With Smoke
"My Life and Times With Antonin Artaud" is a movie to make you long for those good old Parisian days of chain-smoking Gauloises in sidewalk cafes and passionately debating art and literature while imagining that the future of Western civilization depends on the publication of your first book of poetry.
Set in and around Paris in the late 1940's and directed by Gerard Mordillat in the freewheeling style of early Truffaut and Godard, this terrific black-and-white film has a grainy look to match its postwar bohemian ambiance.
Jacques Prevel (Marc Barbe), the movie's fictitious central character, is a hawk-faced young poet of boundless self-absorption who latches on to Antonin Artaud (Sami Frey), the French poet, theatrical impresario and founder of the Theater of Cruelty.
The film is Prevel's journal of a two-year friendship that ends in 1948 with Artaud's death.


Brutality Suit Filed Against Police Officer
The widow of a security guard who died in a confrontation with a New York City police officer last December has filed a $48 million lawsuit against the officer, his colleagues, and the city.
The lawsuit against Officer Francis X.

More Backstage Intrigue, Egotism And Meaningful Old Movie Clips
"The Larry Sanders Show" and "Dream On" begin yet another new season on HBO this evening, and everything remains blessedly off the wall.
Forget Letterman and Leno.
Larry Sanders, eerily and hilariously embodied by Garry Shandling, is this decade's ur-talk-show host.
Ego trips and neuroses are his stock in trade, even as he copes with various substance abuses and unfailingly failed affairs.
Last season ended, you may remember, with Larry re-igniting a relationship with his good friend Roseanne.
But it turns out the romance was limited, lasting, as Larry recalls, "from the Emmys to the People's Choice Awards."

Technology Stocks Lead Market Selloff
Only a day after posting several records, the stock market fell sharply yesterday in its biggest decline in nearly nine weeks.
The drop was attributed in part to some traders' concern about technology stocks, especially Microsoft.
These issues have been high fliers that have outpaced the overall market to reach record levels, but they could now be rising higher than their earnings warrant, traders fear.


Wine Talk
TAKE care, you wine lovers; the anemic dollar will get you if you don't watch out.
Over the last year, normally expensive French wines have become even more expensive, and there is every reason to believe that another round of price increases will come in the fall.
Good wines, like the 1993 Burgundies, are going to be hard to find and expensive to buy.
Even indifferent wines, like the 1992 Bordeaux, are up 15 percent or more over their autumn 1994 prices.


McVeigh Refuses a Handwriting Sample
For the first time since the Government says he came here with a bomb, Timothy J. McVeigh traveled to downtown Oklahoma City today for a hearing and refused to give the grand jury a handwriting sample that could show if he rented the truck that blew up the Federal Building.

The grand jury is meeting in the Federal courthouse facing the explosion site, coming through an entrance still adorned with purple mourning ribbons and rough board windows.

The Mets are playing their best ball of the season, and Bobby Bonilla has been at the center of it as the club's only .300 hitter and most consistent player.

The Mets also want the right-handed relief pitcher Armando Benitez.

Koreans Ponder Whether Economic Miracle's Pillars Are Shaky
When a military Government here once needed scenic foliage for a ceremony and had no time to plant it, soldiers cut down forest trees and stuck them into the ground to fill out the picture.
For Lee Chul, an outspoken legislator, that maneuver is a metaphor for the problem facing South Korea today: in the country's race to develop, people have taken shortcuts at every turn.
This mentality was made too clear last month when the Sampoong Department Store collapsed in a heap of concrete, wires and asbestos, killing at least 400 people and injuring 900 more.

Big New Trade Gap Deepens Clinton's Political Problems
The nation's trade deficit set yet another record in May, despite remarkably strong exports, compounding a political problem for the Clinton Administration, which is trying to portray its string of trade agreements in Asia and North America as its greatest foreign policy success.
The Commerce Department said today that the deficit was $11.4 billion for the month, just slightly above the April deficit but more than $1 billion higher than many economists expected.
President Clinton's economic advisers, increasingly attuned to the politics of the monthly statistics, said that a close look at the figures demonstrated the economy's continued strength.


Blades Charged In Death Of Cousin
Brian Blades, the receiver for the Seattle Seahawks, was charged today with manslaughter in the shooting death of his cousin.

Under Florida law, manslaughter is a second-degree felony defined as the killing of a human being through negligence or without lawful justification.


Council Vote Clears Way For Pathmark
Plans to build a 65,000-square-foot Pathmark supermarket in Springfield Gardens, Queens, won approval from a City Council committee yesterday, virtually assuring that the store will be built, but only after the developer agreed to donate more than $400,000 over the next 20 years to other merchants in the area.
Under the agreement, the money would be distributed to merchants who would be Pathmark's competitors and used to renovate facades, for example, and make other store improvements.
Community groups would also get money for projects like youth programs.

Certainly the love of estheticism is there at Stubbs Books and Prints.
As is the quality that Sir Osbert Sitwell called an enormous tolerance for the untoward or eccentric.

Finale for Palmer Spices St. Andrews Drama
It was one of those classic British Open moments, the sort that Arnold Palmer has starred in across the last three decades.
He was on the third hole at the Old Course today, on the eve of his last appearance in the Open, and the Scots who had come out to see him were leaning over the the gallery ropes, trying to breathe his air.
He had driven his ball into the rough, almost into the crowd, and they were happy.
"Sometimes we like it when you hit a bad shot, too, Arnie," one of them said, and Palmer smiled.
He then slashed his ball out of the high grass, taking an enormous divot, and the crowd roared its throaty approval after the man, now 65 years old, who strode away actually hiking his pants.

Heat Death Toll Rises to 436 in Chicago
Like the grisly toll from some distant war, the number of dead from last week's murderous heat wave here climbed to 436 today, and the medical examiner is not finished counting.
But while the weather has cooled, the debate about why so many died has inflamed this city's combustible politics, with Mayor Richard M. Daley and other officials trading sharp accusations over who is to blame for not doing enough to save the poor, infirm and aged from the consequences of Chicago's most crippling siege of summer heat in memory.

The Bosnian Government denied the Serbs' report, and United Nations officials here had only sketchy information because their troops were confined to an area outside Zepa town.
But earlier today, the officials said the Serbs were poised to take the town, in a rugged mountain valley, where the Muslims were outgunned by the Serbs.

CBS News Revisits Migrants 35 Years Later
Thirty-five years ago, when CBS News was known for its documentaries, "CBS Reports" delivered the memorable "Harvest of Shame," an expose of the harsh existence of America's migrant workers.
David Lowe produced; Edward R. Murrow narrated.
Tonight, "CBS Reports," which was reborn two years ago, returns to the subject with an hourlong look at how much or little the changes speeded by that program have done to better the lives of farm workers.
Reported by Dan Rather and Randall Pinkston, "Legacy of Shame" revisits Belle Glade, Fla., a stop on the earlier investigation too, and travels to fields in South Carolina, where workers are found still to be in a state approaching peonage, and to California, where they do their planting and picking in pesticide-soaked fields.

Push for Line-Item Veto Runs Out of G.O.P. Steam
One of the top items in the Republicans' Contract With America, a "line-item veto to restore fiscal responsibility to an out-of-control Congress," appears to be dead.
Despite passing both houses by overwhelming margins earlier this year, the proposal became a victim, in large part, because of a loss of enthusiasm among Republicans.
Now that they control Congress, many are reluctant to give a Democratic President the power to strike specific parts of spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation -- a change that might result in a significant shift of authority to the White House from the Capitol.

There has been a sharp increase in smoking among young teen-agers in the United States, according to a survey of 50,000 8th-, 10th- and 12th-graders, and fewer of them believe that smoking is hazardous to their health.
The shift has alarmed authorities on drug abuse because it makes it clear that after more than a decade of unchanging rates of smoking among youths, significant increases have begun "despite the accumulating evidence of smoking's lethal effects, despite the many new restrictions on cigarette smoking, and despite the fact that smoking has fallen considerably among adults," said Dr.
Lloyd D. Johnston of the University of Michigan Survey Research Center, the director of the study.


Decision in Psychiatrist's Favor
After less than an hour of deliberation, a jury in Hunterdon County rejected on Tuesday the claims of a man who blamed his psychiatrist for the psychosis that led him to stab his wife 100 times, The Associated Press reported.
Michael Komons, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1988 death of his wife, had sued Dr.
Ira R. Morganstern, saying the psychiatrist had not properly supervised his care.


Protection for Elderly Sought
Attorney General Deborah T. Poritz said yesterday that she has formed a 24-member task force to recommend new laws or educational programs aimed at protecting the elderly from consumer fraud.
Older people who live alone are particularly susceptible to fraudulent telephone pitches, said Mark Herr, director of the Division of Consumer Affairs.
"One of the problems we have with elderly people is that they're too polite -- they won't tell someone to take a hike," he said.


Seles to Return With No. 1 Ranking
Monica Seles, once a giggling, grunting teen-ager with the fastest strokes in tennis before a traumatic stabbing in April 1993 forced her to the sideline for two years, confirmed yesterday that she will finally be able to return to the circuit the same way she left it: as the No. 1 player in the world.
Speaking from her home in Sarasota, Fla., where she has been using her brother, Zoltan, as a convenient punching bag while practicing for her July 29 exhibition match against Martina Navratilova, Seles said she is "trying to go back to the normality of what I was doing before all this happened."


Essay; Singapore's Fear
In our last episode about Singapore, we learned that students and faculty at Williams College, an academic bastion of liberalism in Massachusetts, were objecting to the school's plan to honor the Prime Minister of that rich, repressive, anti-American regime.
Evidently Goh Chok Tung, the puppet who is keeping the Prime Minister's seat warm for one of Dictator Lee Kuan Yew's sons, became fearful at the revelation in this space that he may be confronted on his great day by the exiled Singaporean dissident Francis Seow, now a fellow at Harvard Law School.


Economic Scene; When it comes to farm subsidies, the G.O.P. walks a narrow line.
THE most effective political salesmen often work on the thinnest margins.
Consider the Congressional Republican leadership, which must walk a narrow line between new-fashioned, take-no-prisoners conservatism that intrigued voters in 1994 and old-fashioned, scratch-my-back coalition politics.
On the one hand, Republicans are committed to balancing the budget by 2002.
On the other, they are as dependent as Democrats on interest groups that favor welfare -- in their case, corporate welfare.
Perhaps nowhere is the contradiction as vivid as in the struggle over farm policy, a 60-year-old machine for increasing the incomes of favored farmers at the expense of taxpayers and consumers.

BUSINESS SUMMARY FRONT PAGE SQN##386090##STOCKS PLUNGE IN A SELLING SURGE, SWAMPING RALLY Riding one of the most powerful rallies in their history, the stock and bond markets stumbled badly yesterday in one of the busiest trading days ever, raising the specter in some quarters of what Wall Street calls a correction -- a sharp retreat in stock and bond prices. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 57.41 points to 4,628.87. SQN##392480##THE HIGHER THEY RISE, THE HARDER . . .  Yesterday's 35.66-point drop in the Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by technology stocks, was the second worst in the index's history, measured in points, exceeded only by the 46.12-point decline on Oct. 19, 1987. But at the low point yesterday, the decline exceeded the 1987 number. Since closing Monday at 1,005.89, its first-ever finish above 1,000, the index has fallen 53.02 points, or 5.3 percent, to 952.87.

Deciding if It's Time for Kindergarten or Time to Wait a Year
SUSAN MILLAR PERRY decided to give her child that extra push in life by holding him back.
When her son, Nick, was just a toddler, Ms.
Perry began to agonize over whether to delay his entry into kindergarten by a year, until he was nearly 6.
She consulted with friends and his preschool teachers at the West Side Montessori School in Manhattan.
She received conflicting advice from a neighbor who acted as a sort of Greek chorus, telling her one day to hold him back, then changing her tone to advise that the current wisdom was to push him forward.

The Pop Life
Not Really Bragging
Shaggy is not like other dancehall reggae performers.
On "Boombastic," the Top 10 single and title track from his second album, released last week on Virgin records, he raps, "With my sexual physique, Jah know me well built" (Jah is short for Jahweh, or God.) The next thing one hears in the song is Shaggy laughing at himself.
"It's a real braggadocious type of tune," Shaggy, 26, said by telephone recently from the John F. Kennedy International Airport, where he was leaving for a sold-out tour of Japan.
"But I'm not a person who's really the bragging type. I'm laughing because I'm trying not to let anybody take it as being serious. I'm not actually Mister Lover-Lover."

House Republicans spent much of the day fending off Democratic accusations that the firearms lobby had improperly influenced the inquiry into the Government's handling of the siege, which began with a botched raid that left four Federal agents dead and ended 51 days later with an assault by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a fire that killed about 80 people in the sect's compound.

Industrial Flotsam Elevated to Art
LIKE waves at the shore, decorating styles of the last decade -- English country, cozy cottage, Art Deco, Old World and New Age -- have risen and receded, leaving their gentle traces on our sensibilities and on the pillows in many living rooms.
But these trends, with their feeling of fantasy and escape, have not enthralled the photographer Jan Staller.
For nearly 35 years, Mr.
Staller, whose professional focus is the ruins of the man-made landscape (its remote streets and decaying piers, the crumbling West Side Highway, New Jersey landfills, abandoned chemical plants and construction sites after hours), has been attuned to one muse only: 20th-century industrial design, whether in the furniture of masters like George Nelson and Charles Eames or in the myriad anonymous objects that were once an intrinsic part of the machine age.


Chancellor Search Reflects Power Struggle
As the search for a new Chancellor for New York City's schools officially began yesterday with the first of two public hearings, it was clear that the Board of Education and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani disagree on almost every aspect of the process -- from the basic description of the job to the Mayor's very role in the selection.
A month after Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines submitted his resignation amid a barrage of attacks from City Hall, the search is taking shape as a struggle between the Mayor and the board not only over the qualities they envision in a successor, but also over a larger question of who should control the nation's largest school system.

As sound trucks roam the streets and posters accost pedestrians with gleaming images of eager candidates, the central figure in the national elections set for Sunday is not even on the ballots.
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama may not be formally competing, for voters will choose only members of the upper house in Parliament, but a poor showing for his Socialist Party could force his resignation.
And that, in turn, could lead to the collapse of the governing coalition of three political parties, and then a political realignment.

On Men Killing Men, Especially Within a Family
After working nearly 30 hours "subtitling, appropriately enough, Huston's 'The Dead' for its French distributor," Luke Benami goes back to his apartment in lower Manhattan to learn, when he responds to a message from Jerusalem on his answering machine, that his father has just died of a heart attack.
So begins Neil Gordon's brooding first novel, "The Sacrifice of Isaac," an international murder thriller whose outcome hinges on the meaning of the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac.
Luke's father, Yosef Benami, was a towering figure in Israel, a general, ambassador, professor and "hero of the Mosad le-Aliya Bet during the war, famous for his Italian Passage, the still-secret route by which he saved hundreds of Viennese Jews from extermination." Yet his death is the latest in a series of family catastrophes that have seen Luke's older brother, Danni, disappear after deserting from the army during the 1973 War, and their mother commit suicide after leaving their father.

New York City's Board of Education has approved an austerity plan that could lead to bigger classes and shorter school days.
That is hardly the right recipe for educational excellence, but the board says it is the only way it can cope with the restrictive budget that took effect on July 1.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has denounced the plan as another attempt by the board to spare its bureaucracy at the expense of the city's schoolchildren.
The Mayor may be overstating the case, but his instincts are right.
If sacrifices are to be made, they should be made by the school system's administrative apparatus, not by the schoolchildren.

Its shares have gone from just under $:10 (about $16) early this year to $:13.60 ($21.76) yesterday, a rise of 36 percent.
In part, the share price has been driven by strong earnings growth.
But most of the excitement has come from a growing conviction in the market that Thorn-EMI will voluntarily or involuntarily be split into its component parts: primarily EMI Music, one of the world's premier recording companies; music and book retailing, and rentals of home electronics and appliances.

After days of painful uncertainty for thousands of Metro-North commuters, railroad officials invoked a provision in Federal law to postpone a possible strike for four months.

Creditors in a Big Ponzi Scheme Say They've Been Taken Again
Thousands of creditors of the Towers Financial Corporation, who lost hundreds of millions of dollars in what regulators have called the largest Ponzi scheme ever, are saying they have been taken again.
And, they contend, it happened right under the noses of a battalion of high-priced lawyers and financial advisers hired to help the creditors recover their money.
The new fraud was masterminded by John Hall, a Los Angeles businessman whose record includes a criminal conviction and regulatory problems, according to a lawsuit filed two weeks ago in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
The suit and regulatory documents show that Mr.
Hall, who variously uses Thomas and Carlisle as his middle name, reached a settlement in 1992 with securities regulators who accused him of looting a small money-market fund.
He also entered a 1987 settlement with bank regulators who accused him of abusing his position at a failed California bank and was convicted in 1978 of lying to obtain a Government loan.

But that half-hour produced another test of the elaborate procedures developed since the 1987 stock market crash.

Havens Adds Torchiness in Unexpected Places
Torch singing and folk music may be only distantly related on the family tree of pop, but in Richie Havens, who opened a two-week engagement at Rainbow and Stars on Tuesday evening, they seem more like first cousins.
One reason is that Mr.
Havens sings pop as well as folk, spirituals and pop ballads by everyone from the Beatles to Bruce Springsteen.
Another important way in which Mr.
Havens blurs the lines is by stamping everything with the same sorrowful emotional urgency.
His craggy bass-baritone voice seems to rise from the earth in a bleeding-heart cry for the sorrows of humanity.
Echoes of that cry, which can seem indiscriminate and overwrought if applied to the wrong material, infuse the singing of everyone from Joe Cocker to Michael Bolton.

Louis C. Abelson, 83, Founder Of J.F.K. Airport Medical Office
Dr.
Louis C. Abelson, who in 1950 started what became the J.F.K.
Medical Office in a Quonset hut when Kennedy International was little Idlewild Airport in Queens, died on Tuesday at Peninsula Hospital Center in Far Rockaway, Queens.
He was 83 and lived in Far Rockaway and Montauk, L.I.
The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, his family said.


At Tumultuous Hearing, Bombast and Fluster
The subcommittee chairman's fear of a second siege of Waco, bloodless but partisan, threatened to materialize soon after the gavel sounded today at the opening of a high-speed, eight-day hearing into the grisly chaos that marked the first siege two years ago in Texas.
The Democratic minority defending the Clinton Administration's handling of the matter demonstrated the unwieldiness of the special joint committee hearings -- crammed with lawmakers, reporters and photographers -- by raising early procedural objections and complaining that the process was already tainted by a bias toward gun fanciers.

German Business Ethics Loses Some Luster
Whenever corporate corruption in Europe was discussed, German business was held up as the prime example of good behavior.
But that image has been deeply shaken in recent weeks as a spate of high-profile corruption investigations has touched some of the country's blue-chip businesses, like Volkswagen, and even the cherished tennis star Steffi Graf.


Excerpts From Clinton Talk on Affirmative Action
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's speech yesterday at the National Archives on Federal affirmative-action programs as recorded by Federal News Service, a transcription company:
In recent weeks, I have begun a conversation with the American people about our fate and our duty to prepare our nation not only to meet the new century but to live and lead in a world transformed to a degree seldom seen in all of our history.
Much of this change is good, but it is not all good, and all of us are affected by it.
Therefore, we must reach beyond our fears and our divisions to a new time of great and common purpose.

The Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University was evacuated yesterday morning after chlorine fumes began circulating through the four-story building.

Nineteen people were treated, with 17 taken to area hospitals for observation, a university spokesman said.


Race Ignored, Procession Honors Rider
Still stunned and saddened by the death of a fellow rider the day before, the 118 remaining competitors in the Tour de France turned today's stage into a tribute to the rider, 24-year-old Fabio Casartelli of Italy.
This 16th of the 20 stages in the 82d Tour de France was not a race.
It was a procession.
The pack's leaders decreed beforehand that all riders show solidarity for the memory of Casartelli, and so they remained grouped throughout, traveling at the stately pace of 30 kilometers an hour (18.6 miles an hour), about 10 k.p.h. below their average thus far in the three-week race.

Spotlight on Pianist, 12, With the Philharmonic
In a promotional video last winter, Kurt Masur raved about the 12-year-old pianist Helen Huang, who was then appearing in her first subscription concerts with the New York Philharmonic.
That promotion, with its hype and hyperbole, was a mistake.
So was Ms.
Huang's appearance with the Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall on Tuesday night, as part of the orchestra's summer concert series.
Ms.
Huang is a very gifted pianist, fluent well beyond her years.
But critical bluntness is required now lest the pressures that come with being pushed too quickly into the spotlight ruin the possibilities latent in her graceful turns of phrase.
Judging from her rendition of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23, accompanied by Mr.
Masur, she is still a half-formed musician, and a vulnerable one at that.

Boy, 12, Dies in a Rage of Bullets, and a 16-Year-Old Is Held
Friends called him Junior or June or June-Bug.
Quentin Carter was a little guy, a bantam, the class clown and one of the smallest students in his sixth grade at Intermediate School 109 in Queens Village.
Two days before his 13th birthday, he pulled one of his usual routines on an older youth, nagging him comically for a quarter outside a neighborhood grocery store.
The older boy, 16-year-old Brian Wright, was also seen as a little guy by his peers; not physically, but in status.
He was nicknamed Shorty, and had the reputation of an easily bullied boy, a Herb or a nerd, high school acquaintances said.
They branded him a loser.


Wetteland Scatters Yanks' Dark Clouds
There were Royals standing on every base in the ninth inning, John Wetteland was desperately trying to preserve a three-run lead and suddenly a game that should have been over was looking like another dreary outing for the Yankees.
Could they actually botch this potential victory?
Could they add another bleak day to a season of darkness?


Bonilla's Homer in 10th Is the Latest Mets' Magic
This was the kind of game the Mets would have lost during their miserable first half of the season.
A 2-0 lead had turned into a 4-2 deficit.
They had been robbed of a run in the fifth inning by a bad call and seen the rookie pitcher Bill Pulsipher get tagged for a momentum-turning, three-run homer minutes later.
But since the All-Star break the Mets have embraced a new confidence and a never-give-up attitude.
So when Bobby Bonilla belted a towering home run in the 10th inning tonight at Busch Stadium, it not only lifted the Mets over the Cardinals, 5-4, but reaffirmed that this streak of success is not just a mirage.


China's Plans to Make Family Car Are Receding, Official Says

In the first public comments on the family car by a senior member of China's car bureaucracy since last fall, Huang Fuheng, general manager of the China National Automotive Industry Sales Corporation, said that making family cars salable would be a "very long and very complicated" process.

Terror in Montana
Iserve as a municipal judge in the towns of Hamilton and Darby in western Montana.
Hate groups like the Militia of Montana, one of the most extreme self-styled paramilitary organizations, have been active in our area for several years.

He described his appearance as a "special visitation" and refused to cooperate with the initial proceedings.
He said he was not in any way bound by the laws of Montana.

Clinton Assails Officers' Racist Event
As President Clinton joined the growing list of critics of the annual "Good Ol' Boys Roundup" in the east Tennessee mountains, the organizer of the events defended them today as legitimate parties where Federal and local law-enforcement officers got a chance to know each other.
Gene Rightmyer, a retired agent of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said that when a few racist incidents had occurred among some beer-sodden participants, he had told the culprits to stop or leave.
He strongly denied assertions, first made by a member of an Alabama paramilitary group, that this year's gathering featured the sale of "nigger hunting licenses" or T-shirts emblazoned with the Rev.
Martin Luther King's face behind a target.
Mr.
Rightmyer said two black officers, including one from the firearms agency, had attended this year's gathering, and that when he learned that four white officers had complained about the blacks' presence, he told them, "You can do one of two things. Shut up or leave." The men left, he said.


In L.I. Death, Mouse Seems To Be Source Of Fatal Virus
Tests indicate a possible link between the death of a Long Island man in April and a virus found in the tissue of a mouse captured afterward in the man's home in Bridgehampton, state health officials announced today.

The virus, which is present in rodent droppings, infects humans when inhaled into the lungs.

They did not berate him yesterday, but he did not sign either.

Japanese Group Keeps Noise Forever Young
When all else fails, rockers use noise and dissonance to get a reaction from listeners.
Through the years, listeners have learned to tolerate more jolts, leading bands to escalate in turn.
The Boredoms, from Japan, still have the power to shock and annoy listeners; their secret weapon is to combine noise with unpredictability.
In a song the band played on Monday night at Irving Plaza as part of the Macintosh New York Music Festival, taps from an electronic drum kit accompanied a repeated guitar note, turning into feedback; Yamatsuka Eye yelled, "Rock and roll!"; a slow riff, accompanied by trumpet, started to grind; the guitar brought in a pentatonic quasi-Japanese melody, which melted into echoey lines.
A heavy-metal riff began and Mr.
Eye started howling, leaping around the stage with karatelike kicks; below him, the mosh pit erupted into motion.
But slow drum tapping returned, and the song ended.

The Higher They Rise, the Harder . . .
Since the beginning of the year, mutual funds investing in technology stocks have made millions of American investors seem like geniuses.
Thousands of funds, from specialists in technology companies to more general investment funds like the $48 billion Fidelity Magellan fund, have produced returns of more than 20 percent in the first half of this year by buying heavily in technology stocks.
But yesterday afternoon, a decline that at first seemed like a temporary cooling of an overheated market sector took on the look of a full-fledged collapse before recovering a bit in the final 90 minutes of trading.
Yesterday's 35.66-point drop in the Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by technology stocks, was the second worst in the index's history, measured in points, exceeded only by the 46.12-point decline on Oct. 19, 1987.
But at the low point yesterday, the decline exceeded the 1987 number.
Since closing Monday at 1,005.89, its first-ever finish above 1,000, the index has fallen 53.02 points, or 5.3 percent, to 952.87.

The House is expected to vote on Thursday on whether to continue spending American tax dollars for fashion shows overseas to promote the sale of mink coats.
Several House members, most of them from states with mink ranches, support continuation of a $1.9 million subsidy to a special mink council, on the ground that American mink ranchers need it to compete in the heavily subsidized foreign mink markets.
Because domestic mink sales have soured, in part as a result of protests by animal rights advocates, American mink ranchers now export 95 percent of their fur.

A great deal of what goes on at the American Dance Festival at Duke University is exchange: of dance forms and styles, ideas and even cultural customs.

The program presented on Tuesday night at the Reynolds Industries Theater suggested that choreographers the world over have trouble editing their work.
But production values were lavish by impoverished American standards, and the emphasis in these sleek-looking dances was on atmosphere rather than the popular American concerns of movement and technique.

Witness Describes Botched-Abortion Scene
As her life drained from her, Guadalupe Negron sat bleeding on an operating table, drowning in her own vomit as a doctor fumbled in a failed attempt to get oxygen into her lungs, a paramedic testified yesterday in the doctor's murder trialy.
The doctor, David Benjamin, is accused of botching an abortion on Mrs.
Negron -- the fetus was 19 to 20 weeks old -- so badly that he caused her death.
At his trial yesterday, the witness, Freddie Neboa, a paramedic for 13 years, told of arriving at the Metro Women's Center in Corona, Queens, on July 9, 1993, and finding the bizarre scene after being told that the woman was suffering a heart attack.


Defending Affirmative Action
In near-evangelical tones, President Clinton made the moral, legal and practical case yesterday for the embattled cause of affirmative action.
It was a sermon the nation needed to hear from a President who can only be helped by exhibiting a strong core of principle.
Instead of the aimlessness that has marked so many White House efforts, this speech offered the zest and forthrightness promised by the Bill Clinton of the '92 campaign.
Gone, too, was the hair-splitting accommodationism of the recent speech on school prayer.
In an address notably free of apologies and political trimming, Mr.
Clinton asserted that "when affirmative action is done right, it is flexible, it is fair, and it works." Instead of running for cover on specious claims of favoritism for minorities and women, Mr.
Clinton met the critics straight on.
"Let me be clear," he said.
"Affirmative action has been good for America."

Stocks Plunge in a Selling Surge, Swamping Rally
Riding one of the most powerful rallies in their history, the stock and bond markets stumbled badly yesterday in one of the busiest trading days ever, raising the specter in some quarters of what Wall Street calls a correction -- a sharp retreat in stock and bond prices.
But because the Dow Jones industrial average made up more than half its losses in the last 90 minutes of trading, it was not clear which way investors would jump this morning.

Even though stock prices have fallen sharply in the last two days, mutual fund investors do not seem to be leaving the market in droves.
Still, the market moves since Monday have frayed a few nerves.
That was particularly true yesterday, when at one point the Dow Jones industrial average was down by as much as 132 points.


G.O.P. SENATORS DEMAND ALL FILES ON WHITEWATER
Setting the stage for confrontation, Senate Republicans today demanded a more complete disclosure from the White House of the files removed from the office of the deputy White House counsel Vincent W. Foster Jr. after he died.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who heads the special committee conducting hearings into how the White House handled Mr.
Foster's papers after his suicide two years ago, suggested that he would go to court if the White House refused, and raised the prospect of a constitutional clash.

John Doe and Exene Go a Little Bit Country
What happens when punk rockers grow up?
Most disappear or pretend nothing has changed, but X, a major Los Angeles punk band when the 1980's began, is trying something different.
On its new album, "Unclogged," X remakes songs from the 1980's with acoustic guitars and country-style arrangements.
At the Bottom Line on Tuesday night, about two-thirds of the songs thrived in their new get-up.
X was never a typical punk band; it's too idiosyncratic to encourage imitators.
John Doe and Exene Cervenka, X's singers and songwriters, set stream-of-consciousness lyrics, full of offhand details, to tunes that sprawl outside rock or country conventions.
The chords take unexpected turns, while the melody often seems to hide between the vocal lines; Mr.
Doe and Ms.
Cervenka harmonize using wide open spaces, not so much blending as intersecting.
They sound earnest and unsettled and are always a little ragged.

House Bill Sets Off Fight In Long-Distance Calling
The long-distance telephone industry began waging war today against a House bill to rewrite the nation's communications laws after the bill was changed late last week to make it much easier for the seven regional Bell companies to enter their $70 billion market.
A coalition led by AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint began buying radio and television time around the country for advertisements that will probably start running early next week.
Top executives at dozens of long-distance companies have blanketed House leaders with letters opposing the bill, while AT&amp;T began pushing its thousands of employees, shareholders and retirees to put pressure on members of Congress.

About 50 young children from a Bronx Head Start center spent a terrifying quarter-hour in the sweltering darkness of a subway car yesterday after the false rumor of a gunman on the train touched off a near-stampede toward the last car.

White House Role Faulted In Inquiry on Aide's Suicide
In the days after the death of Vincent W. Foster Jr., the Deputy Counsel to the President, senior Justice Department officials complained bitterly that the White House was setting improper limits on the investigation into his suicide, threatening to ruin it, according to documents obtained by the Senate Whitewater committee.
Two days after Mr.
Foster died, Deputy Attorney General Philip B. Heymann told the White House counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, that he was "messing this up very badly" and "making a terrible mistake" by forbidding Justice Department lawyers from looking at any papers in Mr.
Foster's office.


Murdoch and Laborite: Britain's New Odd Couple
Tony Blair, the Labor Party leader, is so far ahead in the public opinion polls that even with an election two years off he is treated as a Prime Minister in waiting.
He is a lionized dinner guest, a hot item in the columns, a favorite of profile writers.
They depict him as high-minded but also a bit ruthless -- like a young Faust.
Rupert Murdoch is Britain's most powerful non-Briton.
His media outlets here, built as a waystation between his home-boy start in Australia and his worldwide empire run from the United States, are so influential that critics charge him with single-handedly destabilizing the monarchy and snatching elections.
To old-timers in Labor, he is nothing less than Mephistopheles.

After 3 Deaths, Safe Water Returns to the Jersey Shore
The perilous Atlantic along the Jersey Shore and Long Island turned placid today, its treacherous surf soothed by gentle westerly winds that dissipated potentially lethal riptides and undertows.
All along coastal beaches, lifeguards and beach managers breathed sighs of relief today after five days of turbulent, violent water, with riptides and undertows that drowned at least three New Jersey swimmers and forced lifeguards to scramble to rescue scores of others as they were being pulled away by the surf.
Green flags symbolizing surf safe for swimming replaced the yellow or red flags that had urged caution or banned swimming altogether in recent days because of treacherous seas apparently spawned by Tropical Storm Chantal far out in the Atlantic.


Uncovered Short Positions Drop 3.4% on the Big Board
Open positions of short sales declined 3.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange in the most recent month, but rose slightly on the American Stock Exchange, the exchanges said yesterday.
In a short sale, investors borrow shares from a brokerage firm and sell them, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price and profit on the difference.
Rising share prices cause losses for short-sellers, who must replace their borrowed shares with more costly ones.

Future Is Cloudy for U.S. Festival
The summer gathering of the nation's developing athletes in Olympic-related sports, the Olympic Festival, begins a 10-day run on Friday and faces an uncertain future on a crowded sports calendar.
The festival, which features 3,500 athletes from around the country competing in 37 sports, began in 1978 and was designed to be held in the three years between Summer Olympics.
But growing costs, such as the need to construct velodromes, have made the festival an expensive proposition for host cities, which cannot sign corporate sponsors that compete with the official sponsors of the United States Olympic team and the Summer Games.

Jonathan Borofsky  'Man With a Heart'
Grand Central Terminal  Main Waiting Room  Through Aug. 19
The two versions of Jonathan Borofsky's "Man With a Heart" rise from their pedestals like giant mannequins escaped from a shop window.
The Fiberglas figures -- one painted black, the other white -- stare blankly at each other across the length of Grand Central's waiting room.
Each figure extends an oversize hand with its palm turned out, as if to demonstrate its peaceful intentions.
A circular hole in each figure's chest reveals a large plastic ruby flashing with a regular pulse, accompanied by a tape recording of a heartbeat.
The vast marble spaces of the waiting room resonate with the deep thump-thump of closing valves and the whoosh of liquid coursing through the veins.


Prices of Stocks Are Calm; Dow Advances by 12.68
After Wednesday's tumultuous sessions, the stock market returned to a relative calm yesterday, with the leading indexes inching upward as traders snapped up the stocks made cheaper by the earlier rout in prices.
"Just as stocks do not go up every single day," said Neal Soss, co-founder of Soss &amp; Cotton L.P., an economic consulting firm, "they also do not go down every single day. What today shows is that there were people who wanted to buy stocks, they just wanted to buy a bargain."

Diametric Views of Waco: Federal Agents as Aggressors -- and as Victims of Outlaws
As President Clinton denounced Congressional hearings on the Branch Davidian siege as part of an ideological "war against police," House Republicans today used the hearings to raise the specter of the Government's making war on its own people.
The President told a group of senior law-enforcement officials that it was "irresponsible for people in elected positions to suggest that the police are some sort of armed bureaucracy acting on private grudges and hidden agendas." He said it was wrong to equate the innocent, if fatal, mistakes of Federal agents and the moral "depravity" of the leader of the Branch Davidian sect.

The woman was walking on Douglaston Parkway, near the intersection of Cross Island Parkway and Grand Central Parkway in Douglaston, about 1:45 P.M., when a man riding a bicycle came up behind her, Doram Tamari, a police spokesman, said.
The man pressed a knife to her throat and forced her into nearby Alley Pond Park.

'Collage Made in America'
Michael Rosenfeld Gallery  24 West 57th Street  Through Aug. 25
This summer picnic of mostly small works looks like a smorgasbord of appetizers but adds up to a surprisingly solid meal.
The more than 70 American collages pretty much cover the range of modernist styles, from 1930's geometric abstractions by Gertrude Greene to Fritz Bultman's gestural painted paper piece of 1962, and venture into more contemporary terrain with Chris Burden's sly "Full Financial Disclosure (November)" (1977), a display of all the checks the artist wrote in a single month.
Individual works worth lingering over include abstract pieces by Joseph Stella, Albert E. Gallatin, Charmion von Wiegand and Michael Byron, Mary Bauermeister's ambitious mixed-media assemblage, Gene Hedges's accumulation of burned paper, and figurative works by Benny Andrews and Betye Saar.
Of the handful of artists represented by more than one work, Lenore Tawney is a standout.
Whether she sets cut-up bits of handwriting spinning around a reproduction of a Michelangelo sibyl or turns strips of antique German books into suspended grids, she touches on the roots of the collage medium in language and personal history with a reticent orginality.
Speaking of language, the gallery has also mounted a small show of Fairfield Porter drawings accompanied by printed texts of a few of his poems.
The drawings -- dashed-off sketches, really, in pen and ink -- of summer fields, pretty houses and women reading by lamplight, are fine and, like many of the collages in the adjoining room, share the unpretentious elegance of Porter's words.

Judge Stymies Simpson Lawyers' Effort to Build Case for a Conspiracy
Lawyers for O. J. Simpson, stung by a series of counterproductive witnesses, labored today to call a pair of experts to buttress their contention that Mr.
Simpson had been the target of an elaborate police conspiracy.
But Judge Lance A. Ito stymied their efforts on both fronts.
Mr.
Simpson's lawyers now say they can complete their case in a dozen more court days.
But as witnesses came and went today, largely unmemorably, Judge Ito eviscerated the proposed testimony of one expert and delayed that of another, both of whom had been primed to suggest that the blood found on one of a pair of socks in Mr.
Simpson's bedroom had been planted.

Lower revenue from trading and funds management offset an increase in investment banking and other fees.

Sounds Around Town
Sax, Organ and Guitar
Lou Donaldson, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037.
Lou Donaldson, an alto saxophonist, is one of the great living jazz improvisers, one of a diminishing number of be-bop eyewitnesses.
His records don't in any way reproduce the rhythmic and harmonic blues sophistication he brings to the bandstand, and his humor -- a direct descendant of vaudeville -- explains in good portion what American entertainment used to be.
Mr.
Donaldson, with the release of several of his funky Blue Note albums from the 1960's, is attracting a new, hip audience; he'll be performing with Dr.
Lonnie Smith on organ and Peter Bernstein on guitar.
Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.; there is no third set on Sunday.
The cover is $15 and the minimum, $10.
PETER WATROUS Heavy on Rhythm
Gust W. Tsilis, Visiones, 125 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-5576.
By playing vibraphone and marimba, Gust W. Tsilis tends to leave lots of open space for his improvisers.
That's a good thing, especially when the band's other main soloist is the potent saxophonist Arthur Blythe.
They're after a modern, adventurous sound, and they get it; the rhythm section includes Lonnie Plaxico on bass and Cecil Brooks 3d on drums.
There's a $10 minimum, but no cover.
Sets are Sunday at 9 and 11 P.M.

Trombone Extravagance
Ray Anderson, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785.
Ray Anderson is a loud, aggressive trombonist who likes extravagance; he's a throwback to an era when jazz was a party.
Backed by his Alligatory band, Mr.
Anderson does his best to take the house apart.
It's music for a good time.
Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9 and 11 P.M. and 12:30 A.M.; there is no third set on Sunday.
There is a $15 cover and a $10 minimum.

Utility Discounts Permitted
Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman signed a bill into law yesterday that will allow the Board of Public Utility to offer discounted rates to certain retail customers.
The Governor said the bill was designed to attract new businesses to New Jersey and persuade others not to relocate.
Consumer groups had opposed the bill, singling out a provision that will give the utility board more latitude in setting rates on a case-by-case basis.
This part of the legislation "opens the floodgates for utilities to increase the cost of electric service in New Jersey," said Curtis Fisher, program director of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group Citzen Lobby.


COMPANY BRIEFS
LLIANT TECHSYSTEMS, Hopkins, Minn., an aerospace and military company, received a $12 million contract from Hughes Missile Systems Co., a subsidiary of General Motors Corp., to develop a rocket motor.
FARM FRESH INC., Norfolk, Va., a unit of B. Greene &amp; Co., Baltimore, signed an agreement to sell eight supermarket sites to Hannaford Bros.
Co., Scarborough, Maine, which operates chains of retail stores, for about $25 million.


Koreans Seen Buying More U.S. Concerns
Just as the Japanese are licking their wounds from ill-fated investments in American companies, the Korean giants are starting to buy in.
The announcement by LG Electronics on Monday that it would purchase a controlling stake in the Zenith Electronics Corporation for $350 million was only the latest of a recent spurt of investments in well-known American consumer-products and high-technology companies by South Korean conglomerates.

The Occidental Petroleum Corporation and the Sun Company also reported strong quarterly earnings yesterday.


Real Americans, Register Here
It is hard to imagine legislation so dismal that it is opposed by Bill Kristol on the right and the American Civil Liberties Union on the left.
But such legislation, intended to fight illegal immigration, is wending its way through Congress.
It would create a computer registry listing the names of everyone eligible to work in the United States.
The aim is to screen out undocumented immigrants trying to enter the work force.


Democrats Block Vote on Anti-Regulation Measure
The ambitious Republican-led drive to curtail Federal environment, health and safety regulations collapsed today as negotiations to find a compromise stalled and Senate Democrats refused for the third time this week to bring the matter to a vote.
Supporters of the anti-regulation bill, including its chief sponsor, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, conceded tonight's vote was a bitter defeat.
He had characterized the vote as a do-or-die moment for the bill, a central element of the Republican agenda in Congress.


Tagliabue Backs Raiders' Bid to Move
PAUL TAGLIABUE, the National Football League commissioner, has recommended that the league's owners approve the Raiders' move back to Oakland from Los Angeles.
According to several sources, Tagliabue faxed all 30 owners a memo Wednesday night supporting the move.
The owners will vote today.
AL DAVIS, the Raiders' managing general partner, announced last month that he had chosen Oakland, which he left after the 1981 season, over a proposed new stadium in Los Angeles. (AP)


Thompson to Handle Raisin Bran Account
The Kellogg Company said yesterday that it had moved its Raisin Bran cereal account in North America to the New York and Toronto offices of the J. Walter Thompson Company.
The account, with billings estimated at $20 million to $25 million, had been at the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago since 1950.
"On a continuing basis we are making new product assignments and balancing product portfolios," said Karen MacLeod, a Kellogg spokeswoman in Battle Creek, Mich.
"Ultimately, our goal is to have two strong ad agencies worldwide."


Judge Decides Rape Victim In Lawsuit Is Public Figure
Setting the stage for an unusual libel trial against a Daily News columnist, a state judge has ruled that a rape victim who has never been named in press reports was nonetheless a public figure and thus must prove that the writer, Mike McAlary, recklessly ignored the truth in defaming her.
By declaring the woman a public figure, the judge, Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, made it more difficult for her to prevail in her libel suit.
In contrast, private citizens can win libel cases more easily, simply by proving the writer was negligent.


Corrections
A picture caption yesterday about a 12-year-old boy who was killed in Queens and the 16-year-old accused of having shot him reversed their identities in some copies.
The boy wearing a gold chain was Quentin Carter, the victim; the one with a shaved head was Brian White, the suspect.


Clarion Acquires Promotion Company
Clarion Marketing and Communications, a unit of D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles in Greenwich, Conn., said yesterday that it had acquired Fresh Perspectives, a promotion marketing agency in Armonk, N.Y., which is being merged into the Clarion Promotion division.
The terms were not disclosed.
Fresh Perspectives, with 30 employees, brings in billings estimated at $5 million from clients like Johnson &amp; Johnson and Nabisco, which will be added to Clarion Promotion, with 30 employees and billings estimated at $16 million from clients like Quaker Oats and Revlon.


Female Athletes May Be Seeing Long-Awaited Era of Good Will
"I wish every male in the decision-making chain could experience the frustration and puzzlement I've encountered, the reality of discrimination that exists in women's issues," said Charles S. Mechem Jr., the quintessential American white boy.
"It was the biggest single surprise I've come up against. Nothing's ever hit me so completely. I'm not bitter because there's hope for change. Look at me, at 64, finally a feminist."
He is also a 64-year-old smoothie, quick and smart, whose handling two months ago of what he calls the "Ben Wright incident" was a model of damage control; the TV commentator was not punished for allegedly disrespecting lesbians, female golfers and breasts, and the Ladies Professional Golf Association got some desperately needed ink and air time.


In America; Children of the Dark Ages
The next time you pick up a safari jacket at Banana Republic, or a pair of jeans at the Gap, or an Eddie Bauer T-shirt, give a moment's thought to girls like Claudia Molina and Judith Viera, teen-agers who have had to work under extremely cruel conditions to produce much of that clothing.
Until recently, Ms.
Molina and Ms.
Viera were maquiladora workers -- young people employed by the hundreds of thousands in free-trade-zone factories in Central America and the Caribbean to make goods for the American market.
The U.S. companies that benefit from the near-enslavement of these workers pretend not to know about the abuses in the factories, which are independently owned.


Hirosaki Journal; The Victors: Apples Exquisite And Dear
Four farm women, leaves cascading over their sun-bonneted heads, teetered on ladders under the tree and began folding and twisting tiny baby-blue papers around each of the dangling apples.
With a thousand apples on a tree, and a hundred trees to wrap in the orchard, these women were in a rush.
The rising summer sun would soon tan the pale skins of the young fruit.

From Pop to Punk With a Slew of Themes and Variations
One band was nervous, another looked bored.
One band was picky, another was accepting.
It was the first night of the Macintosh New York Music Festival, and as with most of the packed bills at weeklong concert marathons like this one, the lineup at each club was immense and diverse.
On Monday night at Brownie's -- one of 15 clubs taking part -- the music ranged from the new North Carolina rock band Squatweiler to the 13-year-old Milwaukee experimental band F/i; from one of Austin's most talked-about alternative bands, Sixteen Deluxe, to Seattle's less-well-known sound sculptors, Engine Kid.
Haydee Thompson, Squatweiler's singer, spoke in a trembling and out-of-breath voice between songs, but the moment she started singing all apprehension was replaced with confidence.
"Carry your fears with me," she bellowed fiercely in "73 Degrees," from the band's album "All Tempo Hot Pants" (Huel Records).
The band played fast, jagged punk rock as Ms.
Thompson alternated from sweet to sour, screaming angry rants one minute and crooning pop choruses the next.
Trip Costner switched off between hard guitar riffing, crisp college-rock strumming and punk noodling, adding muscle to an already strong performance.


Benetton's unrepentant adman vows to keep pushing the envelope.
OLIVIERO TOSCANI, your worldwide campaigns for Benetton featuring contentious, startling images of strife and turmoil have been ruled illegal by German judges and offensive by a French court.
And they are castigated by consumers who perceive them as opportunistic exploitations of human frailties.
What are you going to do next?
Mr.
Toscani's reply, delivered yesterday in his characteristically puckish manner: more of the same.
An unrepentant, undaunted Mr.
Toscani said he would not only produce additional provocative advertising for the clothing lines marketed by Benetton Group S.p.A., but would adopt the same pot-stirring tactics to sell the company's sporting goods like tennis racquets, in-line skates and ski boots.

Synthesizer at Work
Stereolab and John Cale with the Soldier String Quartet, Central Park Summerstage, midpark at 72d Street, Manhattan, (212) 360-2777.
Stereolab, an English pop band, and John Cale, an original member of the Velvet Underground, are pop historians of different natures.
Stereolab looks low, and Mr.
Cale looks high.
Grounding their sound in percolating Moog synthesizers and bubbling organs, Stereolab flips through the back pages of mid-century kitsch, singing odes to synthesizers past and obscure musicians who tried to become pop heroes.
Mr.
Cale, on the other hand, finds his source material in the poems of Dylan Thomas and the annals of minimalism.
Even Elvis Presley's "Heartbreak Hotel" becomes a composition instead of a song when he sits down at his piano to perform it while the Soldier String Quartet scrapes and slides in the background.
The free concert is tomorrow at 3 P.M.
NEIL STRAUSS Pop Magic
Arthur Lee and Love, the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300.
Arthur Lee, best known for leading the psychedelic pop band Love in the 1960's, has his own way of turning the mundane into the magical.
Since he reformed Love with younger musicians three years ago, Mr.

On a good night, his voice remains sweet and dreamy and his music a beautiful pop swirl.
He will perform tomorrow at 7:30 and 10:30 P.M.; admission is $15.

Guilty Verdict for Furious Driver
A Verona teen-ager who prosecutors said had flown into a jealous rage upon learning that her boyfriend might have made another girl pregnant was acquitted of murder but convicted of death by auto and fourth-degree assault by auto yesterday in the death of a friend and the injuring of another in a fatal car accident last year.
The dead youth, Robert Maffei, had been riding with the teen-ager, Shana Romano, when she drove her father's Mercedes into a parked truck.
Another passenger, Ed Brech, suffered brain damage in the crash.
The teen-age girl who had sparked Ms.
Romano's rage was also in the car when the crash occurred but was not injured.


Book Says Prudential Continues to Pay a Former Executive
Prudential Securities Inc. has continued to pay millions of dollars to the former head of its limited partnership division even after widespread fraud was discovered in the sale and operation of the partnerships it sold to hundreds of thousands of small investors in the 1980's, a new book about the scandal asserts.
The book, "Serpent on the Rock" (Harper Business), by Kurt Eichenwald, a New York Times reporter who covered the scandal as it unfolded, says the continuing payments to James J. Darr, the head of the unit, and other executives who assembled and marketed the limited partnerships have never been disclosed to investors.
Mr.
Darr was forced out of the firm in 1988 after accusations of widespread fraud in the sales and marketing of the partnerships he oversaw.

New Jersey Is Stretching Parole Officers' Days
New Jersey parole officers will start working evenings and weekends to stretch the hours and resources available to check up on parolees at home or at work, a senior official at the Department of Corrections in Trenton said yesterday.
The change, which will begin next month, comes at a time of angry public reaction to the handling of the case of Darnell Collins, the ex-convict from Atlantic City who killed seven people in New York and New Jersey before he was shot and killed by the police.


Tax Fraud: Two Baseball Legends Say It's So
Duke Snider and Willie McCovey, two baseball Hall of Famers whose images of power and dignity still sparkle for generations of the game's loyalists, pleaded guilty yesterday to Federal tax fraud charges, saying they had knowingly failed to report thousands of dollars earned by signing autographs and participating in sports memorabilia shows.
The two slugging legends, who had spent their physical primes playing under the bright lights of stadiums across the country, yesterday stood under the ordinary glare of the fluorescent ceiling lights in Federal Court in Brooklyn, where they raised their right hands, swore oaths to tell the truth, and pronounced themselves criminals.
And so for the first time, the stars from the game's gilded age were enveloped in a crime that up to now has involved players only from its more troubled present.


Westinghouse And CBS Plan Talks on Deal
The Westinghouse Electric Company and CBS Inc. are meeting this morning to negotiate the terms of a takeover offer that Westinghouse hopes to make for CBS within the next several weeks, executives close to the discussions said yesterday.
But even as they gather at the Manhattan headquarters of the Loews Corporation, the company that is controlled by the chairman of CBS, Laurence A. Tisch, key issues remain unresolved.
These issues include the price for CBS shares and how quickly a takeover, which would involve the transfer of television station licenses, could win approval from the Federal Communications Commission.


Murray Riese, 73, Restaurateur Who Developed the Food Court
Murray Riese, the younger of the redoubtable Riese brothers, who blanketed Manhattan with fast-food restaurants, died on Tuesday at his home in Great Neck, L.I.
The Riese brothers were widely credited with developing the concept of the food court, a cluster of fast-food restaurants.
At his death, Mr.
Riese, who was 73, was chairman of the privately held Riese Organization, which operates almost 200 restaurants in New York, many of them national franchises like T.G.I.
Friday's, Houlihan's and Dunkin' Donuts.

In House, Tirade on China, but a Vote to Keep Trade as It Is
The House railed long and fervently today against China's arrest of Harry Wu, China's use of prisoners as factory workers, China's sale of missile blueprints to its allies and China's use of forced birth control.
But given the opportunity, it declined to show its displeasure in unmistakable fashion: by revoking China's preferred trading status with the United States.


Just in Case You Missed It: Legislating, Council Style
THE CITY COUNCIL, so long a legislature-in-training that the city had gotten used to it, did a little serious business this week.
It was most illuminating.
In one afternoon, some of New York City's lawmakers figured out how to make political profit from their votes by levying an ill-disguised tax on developers.
And others embarrassed themselves and their colleagues when they won what they wanted by losing.
Now that's legislating.

"It will be even worse for a lot of people," said Dr.
Joseph Gerstein, the president of Smart Recovery Self-Help Network, a nationwide nonprofit organization based in Willoughby Hills, Ohio, which supports self-help groups.

Maulana Fazlur Rahman, a member of Pakistan's Parliament and the leader of the influential Jamiat-e-Ulem, an Islamic party that supports Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, said on Wednesday that he would "do everything" to persuade the militants to free the captives.

Art in Review
'Color' 'Sign, System, Sensibility'
Stark Gallery  560 Broadway (at Prince Street)  SoHo  Through today
You can't go home again.
The work in this exhibition, organized by the painter Richard Kalina, suggests that artists are going back to color, but that color itself can no longer be treated as a purely formal issue: real-world references and meanings keep leaking in.
Two drawings by the Washington Color School veteran Gene Davis provide a reminder of the heroic 1960's, when the stripe seemed like the ideal vehicle for the investigation of "pure" color.
But close on their heels comes a 1995 "painting" by Polly Apfelbaum in which strips of colored velvet are superimposed on a striped bed sheet.
The viewer moves abruptly from the heights of abstraction to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where the walls of shops are lined with bolts of discontinued fabrics.


Spanish Leader Is Accused In Killing of Basques in 80's
A member of the conservative opposition who was once a member of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist Party said today that the Spanish leader knew about the death squads that killed 27 people connected to the Basque separatists in the 1980's.
After two hours of closed testimony before an investigating magistrate, the official, Ricardo Garcia Damborenea, former general secretary of the Socialist Party in the Basque country, said at a news conference that he had personally talked to Mr.
Gonzalez about the political strategy behind the shadowy hit squads -- "not once, but several times."

SALOMON INC. (SB,N)
Salomon Inc. posted a loss yesterday for the second quarter of $60 million, or 73 cents a share -- slightly less than the Wall Street firm had predicted -- as losses in its commodities and bond trading activities offset gains in its investment banking division.
Salomon had said earlier in the month that it would report a loss of $65 million for the quarter.
In the corresponding quarter of 1994, the firm recorded its widest quarterly loss ever, of $204 million, or $2.08 a share.

Quarterly Reports Show Uneven Profitability for Baby Bells
Paced by growth in local phone lines and cellular customers, two of the nation's seven regional Bell companies yesterday posted net gains and one reported an operating profit for the second quarter.
A fourth Baby Bell said profit fell because of increased competition.
The Bell Atlantic Corporation said second-quarter net income rose 7.7 percent, and the Ameritech Corporation posted a 13 percent increase.
The BellSouth Corporation reported a 7.8 percent increase in operating profit, but charges resulted in a loss for the quarter.
Profits of the Pacific Telesis Group fell 6.5 percent.


Abroad at Home; What Should We Do?
More and more Americans are coming to believe that this country must act to stop the horror in Bosnia.
Some who long opposed involvement find it unbearable to see the latest victims of Serbian aggression and know that the world's greatest power is doing nothing about it -- nothing about nationalist fanatics, in Europe, who hang young boys because they are of a different religion.
What should we do?
The only serious answer is to supply elements of force to resist the aggressors.
Force is the one thing the Bosnian Serb leaders respect.
All along they have attacked only when they were confident that the West, especially the United States, would not intervene.

International Briefs; Mum's the Word At Smith New Court
Smith New Court P.L.C. remained close-mouthed yesterday at its annual meeting about its takeover talks, leading to speculation that a purchase of the stockbroker could still take some time.
"Unfortunately, I am advised I will not be able to make any statement," the company's chairman, Michael Marks, said at the meeting.
Smith New Court is in talks with both Merrill Lynch &amp; Company and Commerzbank A. G., the German bank.


FAMILY-AID PLAN REJECTED IN HOUSE
The House Appropriations Committee voted today to dismantle a 26-year-old program, long supported by Republicans, that provides family planning advice for poor and low-income women.
The committee adjourned without taking up an even more contentious issue, an amendment that would allow states to choose whether to use Medicaid money to pay for abortions in the case of rape or incest.
Current regulations require states to make the money available in such cases.


Susan Smith's Lawyer vs. the Electric Chair
David Bruck is not at all flamboyant, and his soft voice does not always make it to the far reaches of a courtroom.
Although courteous and pleasant in one-on-one conversation, he has only a modest talent for banter.
He might not be the one to liven up a backyard barbecue.
All he seems to care about (other than his family, anyhow) is fighting the death penalty and saving the lives of those who face it.
As the lawyer for Susan Smith, on trial in Union, S.C., for drowning her two children, he is now on center stage, where he seems a good deal less comfortable than, say, F. Lee Bailey.


Growing Up Troubled, In Terrifying Ways
THE beggar on the New York subway has a body truncated at the waist and he rolls on a cart, chanting "I have no legs!" in a singsong as he passes.
Just for a moment, he attracts the notice of Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) and Casper (Justin Pierce), who look young and healthy but are actually much more damaged than this legless man.
As Larry Clark's "Kids" so harrowingly demonstrates, these two are part of a spiritually dead teen-age culture built on aimlessness, casual cruelty and empty pleasure.
Mr.
Clark's vision of these characters is so bleak and legitimately shocking that it makes almost any other portrait of American adolescence look like the picture of Dorian Gray.

Federal Good Ol' Boys
The national attention now focused on the Good Ol' Boys Roundups -- annual rural gatherings of law-enforcement officers -- has developed into one of the odder public relations battles of recent memory.
An Alabama militia group, eager to discredit the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, has provided news agencies with evidence of racist signs and behavior at past roundups.
The founder of the boozy annual events, a retired A.T.F. agent, says the evidence was doctored to make the racist displays appear more commonplace and more recent than they actually were.
Gene Rightmyer, the former agent who hosts the gatherings, protests that the racist sign shown in a video purporting to be of this year's event actually appeared briefly at the 1990 event and that he ordered the sign removed.
He identified a nasty little group called the Gadsden Minutemen as the source of this bad publicity.
He said he reprimanded participants in 1990 who staged an overtly racist skit for the event's "Redneck of the Year" contest.

In Battle Over Public Lands, Ranchers Push Public Aside
The high alpine country near the grave of Ernest Hemingway is some of the prettiest public land in America, with its flower meadows, wild horses and views of the tallest mountains in Idaho.
Signs inform visitors that it is a land of "many uses," overseen for the public by the Federal Bureau of Land Management.
But Congress is now poised to grant ranchers virtual control over this and almost every other part of the 270 million acres of Federal land where grazing permits have already been issued.
People who hunt, fish or hike say the concept of sharing the use of public lands is being shoved aside for a small special interest.

100 Works by Women, Not Intended for Women Only
The painter Elizabeth Murray is the first woman to participate in the "Artist's Choice" exhibition series at the Museum of Modern Art.
And the show she has compiled from the museum's collection -- a sprawling, episodic roundup of art by 70 women dating from 1910 to the mid-1970's -- is so logical and obvious in concept that it feels positively daring.
Even without the inclusion of any overtly polemical work, the show, titled "Modern Women," is deeply political.
A retrospective sweep of decades of accomplishment generally slighted by history could not be otherwise.
More important, the show is so full of visual revelations and intellectual challenges that the revolutionary nature of its collective spirit is clear.


A Thing of Wonder


574 Carjackings in '94
For the first time, carjackings in New Jersey have been tracked for a full year.
Figures collected by the state police show there were 574 carjacking cases reported in 1994, the State Attorney General's office said yesterday.
During the last six months of 1993, there were 306 carjackings, The Associated Press reported.
The survey also showed that 87 of New Jersey's 567 municipalities reported at least one carjacking in 1994.


Arrest in Woman's Death
The plan was to meet at his house and then hook up with friends at a bar in Fort Lee.
Instead, officials said, William David Jones beat his friend Susan Kanner to death late Wednesday afternoon in the basement of the house he shared with his mother.
The authorities said there were signs that Ms.
Kanner, a nurse who lived in Ridgefield Park, may have been sexually assaulted.
Mr.
Jones, a part-time tennis instructor, is under arrest.
Mayor Fred Berenbroick said only one other homicide has occurred in Leonia since 1974.


Watson Shoots a Superb Round While Nicklaus Suffers
From one end of the golf spectrum to the other, the first round of the 124th British Open provided something for everyone today.
It ranged from the sublime story line to the frightful spectacle, from Tom Watson, Ben Crenshaw, John Daly and Mark McNulty all going around the Old Course in 67 strokes to Jack Nicklaus taking a 10 on one hole.
There have been wilder rounds in the 124-year history of the Open.
But not many.
Watson, 45, Crenshaw, 43, McNulty, 41, and Daly, 29, are an unusual quartet of leaders at five under par.
Three old guys and a good old boy on the Old Course?
Why not?
The ball takes funny bounces over here, something to which Nicklaus will attest later.


Extreme Artifice Directly From Life (in New York Between the Wars)
One of the last wishes of Florine Stettheimer, an American painter who died in 1944 at the age of 73, was that all the work in her studio be destroyed upon her death.
This was no small thing, as Stettheimer, who was independently wealthy, never sold her paintings -- although she occasionally gave them to friends -- just as she declined all offers of solo shows.
Luckily, her sisters, Carrie and Ettie Stettheimer, ignored the request.
Florine Stettheimer's witty, deliriously beautiful canvases, which chronicled a weird maidenly life spent with her adored mother and sisters on New York's between-the-wars cultural front, were saved for posterity.
Indeed, they were rather quickly placed on prominent display: in 1946, the Museum of Modern Art mounted a retrospective instigated by one of the artist's closest friends, Marcel Duchamp, and organized by another, the art critic Henry McBride.


Restaurants
Great carved dragons guard the entrance to Korea Palace, giving the restaurant a fancy and slightly forbidding air.
The limousines parked in front only add to the impression.
So it is surprising to walk inside and find that the restaurant has the casual, bright, utilitarian look of a converted coffee shop.
The tables are bare and the small colored lights dangling from the ceiling look left over from the 60's.
And while the air is perfumed with garlic, chilies, sugar and sesame, the efficient metal hoods over each booth inhale all the smoke generated by customers' barbecuing their own meat.
If you would like something a little more upscale, that can be arranged.
The entire back of the restaurant is occupied by small private dining rooms, each equipped with an intercom.
But the private dining rooms can be hot in the summertime, and even in winter Korean meals are entertaining enough to make it far more fun to sit in the large dining room where you can watch what everybody else is eating.

Suicide at a Hotel
A 31-year-old man committed suicide yesterday by jumping from a glass-enclosed elevator at the Marriott Marquis Hotel near Times Square and falling 45 floors.
The man, whom the police identified as George Carragonne, a Manhattan resident, entered the lobby and asked if the building was the tallest in the area.
After being told it was, he took an elevator to the 45th floor, according to an Emergency Medical Services official.


Haselrig Joins Jets After 2 Lost Seasons
Carlton Haselrig remembers the reaction when the Pittsburgh Steelers took him on the 12th and last round of the National Football League's 1989 draft.
"I think a lot of people took it as a joke," he said.
And why not?
Even though he won six National Collegiate Athletic Association heavyweight wrestling titles at Pittsburgh-Johnstown, he did not play football because the school had no team.


Lawyer Living High Life Is Said to Have Ties to Mob
Over the last decade, Dennis J. Pappas proudly assumed all the trappings of a successful lawyer and financial adviser.
He wore $2,000 custom-tailored suits, glided around New York City and Long Island in chauffeured limousines and dashed around the world in private jets for meetings and holidays.
But all that wealth and high living, the authorities asserted yesterday, flowed from his being the financial wizard for the Colombo crime family.
As the 48-year-old lawyer lay in a hospital bed suffering from a heart ailment yesterday, he was indicted on Federal charges of laundering at least $5 million for the Colombo family and fleecing four banks, two insurance companies, two New York City companies and two Pennsylvania physicians of more than $1 million.
And investigators said that $6 million merely represented the money they could trace.


Artist as Nihilistic Victim
"Postcards From America" was shown as part of last year's New York Film Festival.
Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 8.
The film opens today at the Quad Cinema, 13th Street, west of Fifth Avenue, Greenwich Village.
If any American artist in the past decade can be said to have lobbed verbal hand grenades into the culture, it is David Wojnarowicz, the New York-based artist and poet who died of AIDS two years ago.
In his writings, paintings, photographs and installations, Wojnarowicz transmuted his rage as an H.I.V.-positive gay man into explosively visceral polemics that railed against society's hatred of homosexuality, his fatal illness and governmental indifference.


Lukas Is Taking Aim At Saratoga Openers
After moving a million pounds of equipment 180 miles north from Belmont Park, the New York Racing Association was unloading its trucks today and setting the stage for the 127th season of racing at old Saratoga Race Course.

A New Tide Of Refugees From Zepa Is Awaited
International relief officials waited here today for the first influx of Muslim deportees from the enclave of Zepa amid confusion about how many would be coming and when they would arrive.
As darkness descended in this small mountain town, which is near the front lines and was hit with three mortar shells today, the officials said the Bosnian Serbs had told them that 3,500 women and children they were expelling from Zepa would arrive before midnight, but other aid workers said the refugees would not arrive before Friday morning.


Charles Miller, 44, Editor
Charles Miller, editor at large and former managing editor of Artforum magazine in New York City, died on July 12 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.
He was 44, and lived in Greenwich Village and East Hampton, L.I.
The cause was AIDS, said his companion, Gregory M. Griffin.


Compuserve Picks Martin/Williams
Compuserve Inc., the computer on-line service in Columbus, Ohio, owned by H &amp; R Block, said yesterday that it had selected Martin/Williams in Minneapolis to handle its account, which had been at Sive/ Young &amp; Rubicam in Cincinnati, a unit of Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., for the last 13 years.

Senate Panel Approves Flag Amendment
The Senate Judiciary Committee today approved a constitutional amendment to allow the states to make it a crime to desecrate the American flag.
But the committee's chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, left open the possibility that the language might be changed to clear up ambiguities and help win more votes.
The measure, approved overwhelmingly by the House in June, now goes to the full Senate.
Mr.
Hatch, a Utah Republican, said the measure faced an uphill struggle but predicted it would garner the 67 votes necessary to send a constitutional amendment to the states for ratification.

New York State Open Goes McDougal's Way
Playing at 7,175 yards, the Monster course at the Concord Resort spreads fear even to golf's long hitters, but Ron McDougal becomes inspired by its challenge and has usually found a way to tame this layout.
The 32-year-old McDougal, the assistant to Nelson Long at Century Country Club in Purchase, N.Y., for the last six years, captured the $65,000 New York State Open here this afternoon with a 54-hole total of eight-under-par 208.
That was four shots better than Mark Mielke, the head pro at Lawrence Golf Club on Long Island and the winner of this tournament in 1992.

G.M. Rise Bucks Quarter's Auto Earnings Trend
If they ever played Broadway instead of Wall Street, the Big Three auto companies might consider calling their act The Perils of Pollyanna.
With their widely varying second quarter earnings reports this week, they demonstrated the danger in their business of excessive optimism.
The Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, which had breathlessly predicted robust sales this spring, built too many cars and trucks and watched their earnings slide in the second quarter as they ladled out rebates and other incentives to entice indifferent buyers.


Finding Brett Weston's Own Identity
Throughout his long life, Brett Weston, who died two years ago at 81, was never able to escape the shadow of his father, Edward, the Modernist hero renowned for his sensuous close-ups of rocks, vegetables and other natural objects.
The two men worked in similar styles and photographed similar subjects; so close were they that in the years before his death in 1958, Edward Weston entrusted much of his darkroom work to his son.
Nevertheless, in the course of his career Brett Weston produced many photographs that, while echoing characteristics of his father's images, have their own distinguishing qualities.
The current presentation at the Burden Gallery of the Aperture Foundation, "Brett Weston: Voyage of the Eye," including an extensive selection of his later work, provides a welcome opportunity to assess his achievement.

Sports of The Times; Baseball's Sad Song Plays On
SUBSTITUTE one Willie for another, McCovey for Mays, and the singer-songwriter Terry Cashman suddenly has fresh material to reprise his once-popular (though terrifically annoying) jingle about "Willie, Mickey and the Duke." The times, however, they are a-changin', and baseball's songs are increasingly sounds of sadness.
In Dallas last week, Mickey Mantle presented himself to a national television audience as the portrait of an American icon turned withered alcoholic.
In Brooklyn yesterday afternoon, Duke Snider and Willie McCovey stood in front of a United States District Judge named Edward R. Korman and admitted that they, like the soon-to-be Yankee Darryl Strawberry, were income-tax cheats.

Everyone Agrees: Seles to Return at No. 1

According to Worcester, Seles will be co-ranked No. 1 for her first six tournaments, a condition never opposed by other top players.
But Worcester confirmed that the entire 18-month transition period during which Seles will receive additional special ranking privileges did not meet with unanimous approval.


2 Marketers Expand Ties With Agencies
Two large advertisers have expanded relationships with agencies on their rosters.
Mars Inc. in McLean, Va., named D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles in New York to handle advertising for two new lines, Kan Tong packaged rice and Eastern Traditions packaged Middle Eastern rice dishes.
The billings were not disclosed.
The brands, part of the Uncle Ben's food group, had been at Bates Worldwide, a unit of Cordiant P.L.C., until Mars ended its longtime relationship with that agency in February.
D.M.B.&amp; B., which handles the Uncle Ben's account, was awarded the new lines after a six-week review that also included Merkley Newman Harty in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, and the Richards Group in Dallas.

I.B.M. said it would kill its own competing product called Workgroup as well as electronic mail software that competed with cc:mail, Lotus's more successful offering.


So Young and Self-Conscious
"We are young," Supergrass proudly declares in its current Top 10 British hit, "Alright." Its songs are about the hopes and frustrations of young people who want to break free of boredom, get out and have a good time.
Yet its music has vintage charms, modeled on an English rock pantheon: David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and the Who.
At the Mercury Lounge on Tuesday night, as part of the Macintosh New York Music Festival, Supergrass revved up some of the best ideas of rock's last three decades.
The band is a trio, sometimes abetted by a keyboardist outside the spotlight; as the trio concentrated on its instruments, their exuberant musicianship became showmanship.
In fast, tuneful songs, Danny Goffey on drums and Mickey Quinn on bass built muscular, eruptive crescendos like the early Who.
Gaz Coombes on guitar moved from insistent strumming to wailing leads, singing with Mr.
Bowie's yelps or Mick Jagger's nasal swagger.

The deal would be structured as a merger of equals, in which neither bank would pay a premium to acquire the other.
The headquarters would be in Boston, which has been a prerequisite for the Bank of Boston's board.


4 Metro-North Unions Reach Tentative Contract Accord
Four Metro-North unions reached tentative contract agreements with the railroad yesterday, drawing angry charges from other unions that the four had been bought too cheaply, and further fragmenting the unions' united front.
After five hours of predawn talks with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the railroad's parent agency, the unions representing mechanics, machinists, firemen and oilers, and sheet-metal workers accepted an enriched variation of the railroad's offer of a 10.3 percent wage increase over four years.
All four unions agreed to give Metro-North greater scheduling flexibility, and the Transport Workers Union, which represents rail car mechanics and car cleaners, agreed to allow the use of part-time cleaners, one of the most controversial of the M.T.A.'s work-rule demands.

Disney Getting a House of Its Own on Broadway

Butler Stays Hot; The Mets Do Not
Even when you are a team on a roll as the Mets have been lately, it's difficult to achieve success when your pitching can't keep the baseball in the park.

Making his first appearance in 15 days, Mlicki allowed two home runs, a two-run blast by Ray Lankford and a three-run rocket by Darnell Coles that helped the Cardinals to an 8-6 victory at Busch Stadium.

Bosnian Exit Strategy
President Clinton was right to turn down France's request for American helicopters to ferry French reinforcements into the besieged Bosnian town of Gorazde, even though his decision will probably hasten the U.N.'s departure from Bosnia.
Those helicopters would have required American spotters and ground crews, punching a hole in the Administration's policy of keeping American ground troops out of Bosnian combat zones.
However flawed the President's record has been on other aspects of the Bosnian crisis, he deserves credit for avoiding American combat fatalities.
It would be reckless to jeopardize that achievement now in a long-shot bid to halt the Bosnian Serbs from consolidating their stronghold in eastern Bosnia.


In Brooklyn, Both Sympathy and Dismay
George Mullane, a Bay Ridge bartender who remembers sneaking into Ebbets Field as a teen-ager, shrugged at the news that one of his baseball idols had pleaded guilty to tax fraud yesterday.
"I know it's wrong what Duke Snider did, don't get me wrong," Mr.
Mullane said in the hazy, neon darkness of the Brooklyn Dodgers Bar on Third Avenue.
"But he's no different than anyone else in baseball these days. There's money out there to be had, and Duke just got on the bandwagon. He also just happened to get caught."


Mesa Board Backs Pickens Vs. Dissidents
Mesa Inc., threatened with a takeover by dissident shareholders a few weeks ago, demonstrated today that it had recovered the power to set its own course.
In a four-hour meeting here, the board of Mesa rallied behind its chief executive, T. Boone Pickens.
It refused to make more than minor revisions in a plan to fend off takeovers.
The so-called poison-pill plan prevents hostile investors from raising their combined stake past 10 percent by giving other shareholders the right to buy more stock at a 50 percent discount when the 10 percent threshold is reached.
The board also heard investment bankers describe plans for the company's whole or partial sale.


Inside Art
Airport '95
Bookstores, cafes and exercise studios aren't the only unconventional places to find interesting art.
Now airports are, too.
Adorning the walls of the newly renovated Tower Air terminal at Kennedy International Airport are works by artists like Frank Stella and Robert Rauschenberg.
This was no afterthought: part of the terminal's $8 million renovation included creating proper spaces to show paintings, sculpture and prints.
Jeffrey Deitch, a private dealer based in New York, masterminded the project.
"I've been concerned that the art business has not found enough new collectors to replace those from the 80's who have disappeared," he said in a telephone interview this week.
"Making a terminal into a giant art gallery means that thousands of people will see the works every day."


International Briefs; Strike at Air France
Striking flight attendants forced Air France to cut its summer schedule yesterday by 30 percent for a second day.
Three unions called on 6,100 members to stay off the job until last night to protest work conditions at the money-losing airline, which has been trying to increase productivity and trim its work force.
Air France has said it cut its losses last year to 2.3 billion francs, or about $470 million.
That compares with a loss of 8.48 billion francs in 1993.
About a third of the state-owned carrier's flights were canceled on Wednesday. (AP)

First Major Film With an NC-17 Rating Is Embraced by the Studio
For five years movie studios have viewed the highly restricted NC-17 rating as commercial death.
The rating, which bars films to viewers younger than 17, is seen as especially damaging to a film's prospects because many theaters in malls are reluctant to show films with that rating, newspapers and television networks are nervous about promoting them and video chains like Blockbuster have said they will not rent or sell these films.
But today, after "Showgirls," a film about Las Vegas strippers, was given an NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America ratings board, MGM/UA, the studio that made the film, said it welcomed the rating.
It is the first time that a big-budget studio film ("Showgirls" cost $40 million to $45 million) is being released with an NC-17 rating.

Susan Smith's Lawyer vs. the Electric Chair
David Bruck is not at all flamboyant, and his soft voice does not always make it to the far reaches of a courtroom.
Although courteous and pleasant in one-on-one conversation, he has only a modest talent for banter.
He might not be the one to liven up a backyard barbecue.
All he seems to care about (other than his family, anyhow) is fighting the death penalty and saving the lives of those who face it.
As the lawyer for Susan Smith, on trial in Union, S.C., for drowning her two children, he is now on center stage, where he seems a good deal less comfortable than, say, F. Lee Bailey.


Moore Is at It Again, Rattling Pillars
With baseball cap and sly smile, Michael Moore looks like the kind of amiable giant that the cartoonist Al Capp used to create for L'il Abner.
But beware.
Beneath that angelic-seeming facade lurks irreverence, satire, just plain old adolescent devilment and the rest of that stuff that invariably tends to rattle average pillars of the community.
Mr.
Moore's 1989 film, "Roger and Me," which turned an unflattering spotlight on General Motors plant closings in Flint, Mich., is among the highest-grossing documentaries ever.
In 1994, Mr.
Moore started the weekly magazine show "TV Nation," on NBC.
The reviews were enthusiastic, but the ratings for two limited seasons failed to impress the network.
Now Fox Broadcasting, evidently accelerating efforts to lose its get-no-respect image, is giving "TV Nation" an eight-week trial run.
It begins tonight at 8.

Third World Migrants Risk Hell for a Dream
With dreams of a safe and prosperous life in a faraway country, Williappan Ratnarajah sold his family home in war-racked Sri Lanka and paid a casual acquaintance $10,000 to smuggle himself and his younger brother to Germany.
The months-long journey from Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, to Moscow through Kiev and Bucharest ended in horror last week when his brother, Salam, 24, was one of 18 Sri Lankans who suffocated to death in the back of an airless, padlocked container abandoned on the hot plains of Hungary.


U.S. Wins Support From Britain For Plan to Bomb Bosnian Serbs
On the eve of a critical allied meeting on Bosnia, the United States won support from Britain today for a plan to threaten the Bosnian Serbs with extensive NATO air strikes if the Serbs continue attacks on "safe areas," even if they retaliate against Western hostages.
But France, which like Britain has thousands of troops among the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia, still had not agreed to the plan hours before the multinational conference here was to start.


For Children
Dance Program  Central Park Summerstage  Rumsey Playfield  Midpark at 72d Street  Manhattan  (212) 360-2777  Recommended ages: 9 and up  Tonight
Hip-hop music is not in the same league, of course, as the sugary good-naturedness of many children's recordings.
But older children often prefer the sexy tunes of hip-hop over a sweet song about, say, bugs in one's bed.
Hip-hop has a pop-music aura, and like some television sitcoms, it gives children clues about the grown-up world.
Besides, hip-hop is great dancing music.

Suit Over Landfill Leaks
Twelve years ago, a landfill near the Gloucester County town of Pitman became the first toxic dump to be cleaned up under the Federal Superfund program.
Yesterday, a class action suit was filed in Superior Court that contends that cancer-causing chemicals leaked from the dump into streams feeding Alcyon Lake, exposing people who swam in the lake and their offspring to disease and fertility problems.
Among the named plaintiffs is Pamela Cobb, who attended a Girl Scout camp at the lake in 1970 and later had several miscarriages and ovarian cysts.
Named as defendants are the owners and managers of the landfill, two hauling companies and a half-dozen chemical companies, factories and plants.


The Taming of Broadway's Shrew
SHE'S eccentric, but what great star of silent films wouldn't be after years of public indifference?
Certainly her Hollywood-bizarre, fur-trimmed wardrobe indicates that she's no slave to commonplace haute couture.
She's the kind of woman who might wear pantaloons or a lampshade with the confidence of someone who sets the fashions that others follow.
That needn't be crazy, just self-assurance to an extreme degree.
Don't worry that her fondness for wigs and turbans suggests that she has a problem with thinning hair.
Like everyone else, when she gazes into the mirror, she sees only the image she holds in her mind.
That image is easier to see when supplemented by a wig or a turban.
Her imperious manners can't be ignored, but she's no more neurotic than a spoiled child.
The truth is that she's really a victim.
She's not mad; she's a vulnerable if overprivileged waif.

A BRIDGE OF LONGING The Lost Art of Yiddish Storytelling  By David G. Roskies  419 pages.
Harvard University Press. $37.50.
In the 1880's, Sholom Aleichem, the beloved storyteller of the doomed kingdom of Eastern European Yiddish life, edited and published "The Jewish People's Library," a handsome literary almanac that included stories by the best Yiddish writers of the time.
In David G. Roskies's view, the almanac was a landmark in Jewish culture, but not for the reason it might seem most natural to assume.


Cheers for Mattingly Are Contrast to Controversy
Every day brings new distractions with the Yankees, enough damaging news to turn stomachs and turn their clubhouse into a chaotic and crumbling room.
Jack McDowell was reprimanded by the American League yesterday for his finger-flipping incident at Yankee Stadium and instructed to purchase $5,000 worth of tickets in an attempt to make peace with the fans he offended.
Unfortunately for the fans, McDowell's ticket avalanche did not begin last night because Don Mattingly belted his first homer since May 4, drove in two runs for the first time since that same game and the Yankees clubbed three homers in an 8-4 victory over the Royals.


10 Gang Members in Harlem Are Indicted
For more than five years, the drug gang conducted what prosecutors called a reign of terror in central Harlem, murdering rival gangsters, shooting bystanders and terrorizing the neighborhood surrounding Lenox Avenue and 142d Street.
Gang members even entered Harlem Hospital Center in hospital whites last year, prosecutors said, in an unsuccessful effort to stab a rival drug dealer whom they had failed to kill a few days earlier despite shooting him 15 times.

Election Monitor Criticizes Haitian Vote for Widespread Fraud
The Carter Center, normally a strong supporter of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti, said today that last month's elections in Haiti were riddled with fraud and that the Clinton Administration should not back a series of reruns and runoffs that many Haitian political parties are threatening to boycott.
In its first formal comment on the elections for parliamentary seats and municipal posts, the center released an unusually harsh report today, saying that the Government had failed to seal ballot boxes and that the election commission "stiff-armed" parties that complained about the vote, which Mr.
Aristide's supporters claimed to have won.


Market Place; Westinghouse is an unlikely collection of assets.
THE Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which is negotiating to buy CBS Inc., is many ways, a very sophisticated company.
It has scientists capable of designing miniature atomic clocks to improve the accuracy of the instruments it sells to the aerospace industry.
It has developed a new type of solid-state fuel cell that may one day provide low-cost power in remote areas.
And it owns a very profitable broadcast group, which it now seem to be trying to grow in the most dramatic way possible.
Whether it can do that without the sale of substantial assets is an open question.


Hearings Set On Examining School Crime
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's commission on school safety announced yesterday that public hearings to investigate crime in the school system would begin in late summer or early fall -- precisely when the school board will be in the middle of its search for a new schools chancellor.
While school officials said they hoped the timing of the hearings would not complicate the search, school safety has long been a source of tension between the Mayor and the Board of Education.
Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines decided to resign the day after the Mayor created the safety commission and gave it the power to subpoena witnesses and documents from the school board.

The agreement also includes the development of hotels in at least eight other Indian business and resort centers.
The pact could create as many as 6,000 jobs. (Dow Jones)

The Council of Economic Advisers helped persuade President Kennedy to cut taxes and thus spur a recovery -- a decisive case of applying the theories of John Maynard Keynes to public policy.
The council warned President Johnson that he would ignite inflation if he persisted in paying for the Vietnam War by borrowing rather than taxing -- advice he ignored with disastrous consequences.


High-Wire Lending Acts
So much for the adage "Once bitten, twice shy."

Now these loans are making a comeback.


Bosnia Serbs Surround 'Safe Area' but Defenders Are Defiant
Bosnian Serb troops encircled the town of Zepa today, preparing to complete their conquest of the so-called protected area in eastern Bosnia as defiant Government troops refused to lay down their weapons.
On Wednesday some civilian leaders of the town surrendered to the Serbs, but without the agreement of the 600 to 1,000 Bosnian Government soldiers in the enclave or of the Government.
When the troops ignored an ultimatum from the Serbs to turn in their weapons by 7 tonight, the Serbs lobbed shells into the village, United Nations officials said.

Companies Reach Deal for Renewal In Heart of 42d St.
After 15 years of false starts and dashed hopes, a marathon effort to revitalize 42d Street turned an important corner yesterday as a group of entertainment companies and developers announced plans to open glittering attractions along the shadowy strip that was once the heart of American theater.
Nearly 100 years after enterprising theatrical producers like Oscar Hammerstein and Florenz Ziegfeld began developing glorious and ornate theaters just west of Times Square, the Walt Disney Company said it was firmly committed to anchor the next millennium of entertainment on the street.

Trisha Brown Adds Her Own Special Moves to a Bach Musical Offering

Whether classical music is now mistress to Trisha Brown's choreo graphy will be seen in the future.

The Corner as Trap, Symbol, Vanishing Point, History Lesson
The video monitor is wedged into a corner, behind an overturned table with its legs protruding like spikes from a barricade.
On the walls above hang two birth certificates for the same man, Daniel R. Piper.
One gives his race as white, the other as octoroon.
His daughter, the artist Adrian Piper, appears on the screen below, wearing a blue sweater and a simple string of pearls.
As the viewer settles into one of the chairs facing the screen, her monologue unfolds: "I'm cornered. If I tell you who I am, you become nervous. If I don't tell you who I am, then I have to pass for white." In a racist society, Ms.
Piper suggests, no personal interaction is free of racial shame or hatred.
But any obsession with racial purity must run up against the historical reality of intermarriage.
"What if you find you're part of the great black majority?" she asks.
Will you try to pass as white, or proclaim your blackness?
And if it turns out that you're part of the "white minority," what will you do then?

Peter Halley and Ettore Sottsass
Jay Gorney Modern Art  100 Greene Street (between Spring and Prince Streets)  Through July 28

Mr.
Sottsass's famous "Casablanca" sideboard (more of an armoire, really), designed in 1981, is covered with plastic laminate bearing a black-and-white design like the cover of a schoolboy's composition book; a series of angled shelves protrude from the cabinet like the legs of a huge, rectangular beetle.


Senate Backs Measure to Have Reporters Reveal Outside Income
Asserting that the news media should be as accountable as they are powerful, the Senate today passed a resolution calling for reporters to disclose the sources and amounts of their outside income.

Before Susan Smith had taken more than a few steps up a boat ramp after rolling her car into the lake with her two children strapped inside, she was already wondering what people would think of her, already forming her alibi, a forensic psychiatrist hired by the defense testified today.
What would seem to be a sign of selfishness, of cold-blooded behavior, was instead a sign of the 23-year-old Mrs.
Smith's desperate need to be liked, a need that manifested itself in the months before the killings in a series of sexual encounters with some of the most unlikely people, her lawyers tried to show today.

It reports a father's claim of biblical right to betroth his 11-year-old daughter to a man whose identity he would not reveal and so use her as a weapon in a divorce battle against his wife.

Most of the reductions come from such programs as aid to low-income people, youth and education.  [ 8. ] Poor Reviews for Bank Deal  The proposed merger between Corestates Financial and the Bank of Boston was greeted coolly by investors and analysts, as the shares of both companies fell.

U.S. Drops Demand for More Microsoft Documents
The Justice Department's antitrust division abandoned its demand today for more documents from the Microsoft Corporation, but said it was continuing its study of the company's new Windows 95 computer operating system and implied that it would decide whether to file a suit within the next several weeks.
Today's action came just three days before the Government and Microsoft were to argue over the document request before a Federal judge in New York, and it marked the latest display of brinksmanship in the long-running battle.


Fate of Raiders' Move Now Rests With League
Al Davis won the approval of National Football League owners today to move the Raiders from Los Angeles back to Oakland, but it is still not a done deal.
A major financial hurdle, involving how much of the personal seat licenses revenue the league will get from Oakland, has to be cleared before the Raiders actually return after a 13-year absence.
Davis and Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, in a show of unity, appeared at a news conference following the vote in which 23 of 30 teams voted in favor of the move and 5 abstained (Washington, Jets, Raiders, St. Louis and Tampa Bay).
The 49ers and the Cardinals left the meeting before a vote could be taken.

Senate Rejects Effort to End Preference Programs
In the first legislative test on affirmative action since President Clinton's endorsement of it earlier this week, the Senate has soundly rejected an effort to end set-aside programs run by Congress and other legislative agencies.
By a vote of 61 to 36, the Senate late Thursday night defeated an amendment to an appropriations bill covering the legislative branch that would have prevented agencies including Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, the Library of Congress and the General Accounting Office from setting aside contracts exclusively for companies owned by women and minorities.

New Rules Cut Estate Taxes For the Inheritors of Houses
A little-noticed provision in the Pataki administration's new budget gives residents of the state a substantial break on estate taxes, allowing heirs not to pay tax on the first $250,000 of the value of an inherited home.
For taxpayers who own houses as their primary assets, the change -- tucked away among approximately $600 million in income and business tax cuts passed in the budget last month -- could more than triple the worth of assets that heirs could inherit without paying state taxes.
The heir of a person with a primary residence valued at $250,000 and an estate worth another $250,000 will now pay $7,500 in inheritance taxes, $12,000 less than under the old rules, the State Tax Department said.
The change affects heirs other than surviving spouses, who pay no inheritance taxes.

But the plant is reviewing its procedures to prevent a recurrence.

More Verdi, This Time a Tragedy
It is hard to imagine an operatic world without "Rigoletto," "La Traviata," "Aida" and "Falstaff." But that is what Vincent La Selva and the New York Grand Opera have invited listeners to do in the first two seasons of their seven-year festival, Viva, Verdi in Rumsey Field in Central Park.
Their chronological march through Verdi's 28 operas reached 7 on Wednesday evening with "I Due Foscari," a lyric tragedy completed in 1844, when the composer was 31.
Verdi's second collaboration with the librettist Francesco Maria Piave, after the great hit "Ernani," which was recently presented by the same forces, "Foscari" was less well received.

Dr.
Chopra's book, which is about living longer, was published in 1993.
The earlier book, "The Methuselah Factors," by Dan Georgakas, which also offers advice on how to live longer, was published in 1981.

Mr.
Georgakas complained that about a third of the material in a nine-page section of "Ageless Body" came from his book, either directly or indirectly.

The show was to be among the inaugural exhibitions this month at the new National Gallery of Modern Art, in the renovated Veletrzni Palace in the Czech capital.
But the building is not yet finished, and that was one concern that led the Whitney's director, David A. Ross, to cancel. 'I finally had to make a decision," Mr. Ross said. "To take a Biennial as an opening show is stacking the deck.
It's just too ambitious an undertaking."


Senate Approves Cutback In Current Federal Budget
Having endured a Presidential veto, an unexpected filibuster by two freshman Democrats and at least three pronouncements from the majority leader that it was a dead issue, a revised $16.4 billion package of current-year budget cuts won final approval in the Senate today.
President Clinton said that this time he would sign the new bill, which restores cuts made to education, job training and environmental programs.
It includes something else that Mr.
Clinton badly wanted: $7.3 billion in emergency aid for Oklahoma City and for natural disaster relief to 40 states, including California and Texas.

But with his contract in its final few months, Mattingly is offering signs that he is ready to leave New York.
Meanwhile, the Yankees are offering signs that they are not ready to throw away the season just yet.

U.S. INQUIRY FINDS DETENTION CENTER WAS POORLY RUN
An investigation by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service has found that a privately run immigration prison in New Jersey, the scene of an uprising last month, was run like a secretive fief in which poorly trained and abusive guards preyed on immigrants, with little control from their supervisors.
After releasing the report yesterday, the immigration service said it would not renew its contract with the company to run the center in Elizabeth, and does not plan to reopen an immigration jail in the area. .
After the June 18 violence, the center's 315 immigrants were transferred to other detention centers and county jails.


Chirac Tour Affirms Ties With Africa
With a crisis in Bosnia involving France's peacekeepers, plans for renewed French nuclear testing under attack worldwide and myriad domestic issues demanding attention, some French eyebrows reportedly arched when President Jacques Chirac set out on a three-stop tour of black African countries that began today in the Ivory Coast.
For analysts of French foreign policy, however, Mr.
Chirac's trip is both a reaffirmation of his Gaullist roots and a reminder that the links that Paris still maintains with Africa are nearly all that stand between France and a decidedly more humble international stature.

By a vote of 14 to 10, the university's governing Board of Regents, many of them appointed by Governor Wilson and his Republican predecessor, George Deukmejian, late Thursday struck down the use of race, sex, religion, color or national origin as criteria for admission to the university.
A parallel measure on hiring and contracting passed 15 to 10.

To the Editor:
Speaker Newt Gingrich is in august company when he advocates an air campaign to "break" the Bosnian Serbs, promising to "do it in three days" (news article, July 18).
The Luftwaffe spent more than three years bombing Serbian guerrillas across Bosnia.
Despite overwhelming air superiority, they and their local stooges suffered a crushing defeat.

Senator Scolded for Pressing Packwood Hearing
The chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee today threatened retaliation against Senator Barbara Boxer for forcing the question of public hearings in the case of Senator Bob Packwood before the committee had made its own decision on how to handle the matter.
In an unusual speech on the Senate floor, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who heads the committee, upbraided Mrs.
Boxer, warning that as long as the California Democrat interfered with committee matters, "I will be prepared to discuss and debate Congressional action on misconduct cases in the past and other relevant issues."

Coffey said in a memorandum to the staff, "that even with these difficult reductions, we retain the largest editorial staff in America, over 1,100, with a budget of over $110 million a year for news gathering."

Jews Urge Germany to Use Its Troops
Inverting the often-stated argument that German ground troops should not be sent to the Balkans because of the memory of Nazi atrocities there, two prominent Jews have asked Bonn to send troops to Bosnia.
"Many people hide behind the argument that Germany commited sins in former Yugoslavia and we cannot intervene there militarily," Ignatz Bubis, the leader of the main organization representing Germany's 40,000 Jews, said in a radio interview this week.
"I disagree -- because Germany sinned back then, it has all the more duty to rush to help there."

D'Amato Seeks to Limit Foreign Bailouts
Days after the House of Representatives passed an amendment aimed at cutting off the bailout funds for Mexico, Senator Alfonse M.

Mr.
D'Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and an outspoken opponent of the Mexican bailout, has tried and failed in the past to cut off much of the $20 billion that the Clinton Administration drew from a special Treasury Department account for loans and guarantees that backed Mexican securities.

This followed an opening-round 66, and it left McGann at eight-under-par 134.

Suit Expected Over Smokeless Tobacco Use
A lawsuit accusing five makers of smokeless tobacco of trying to addict young people and damaging their health is expected to be filed on Monday in the Federal District Court in Wichita, Kan.

Dole Issues Medical Records To Meet Age Issue Head On
On the eve of his 72d birthday, Senator Bob Dole today issued a pronouncement by his doctors that he is in excellent health, an effort by the Dole campaign to disarm rivals who insinuate that he is too old to be President.
Although release of medical documentation has become routine among Presidential candidates, it was highly unusual for a campaign to issue it so early.
But Mr.
Dole's rivals for the Republican nomination have begun to raise the issue of his age, however obliquely, and he is eager to put it to rest.


Religion Journal; Media Reflect Changing Spiritual Lives of Americans
When they turn their attention to coverage of religion in the news, media critics often strike a note of complaint, contending that the subject is underreported.

In some instances, that criticism can hardly be disputed.
But one could play the contrarian and point out that something close to 200 reporters around the country, by a recent count of the Religion News writers Association, cover the subject at newsmagazines, newspapers big and small and, lately, a handful of broadcast news organizations.

Observer; Spreading The Rubble
The people ruined so far by the Simpson trial must be numbered in battalions.
I saw one the other day while passing the kitchen TV set.
He was a tow-truck driver.
He'd had the bad luck to be working when the cops ordered the famous white Bronco towed.
He had the bad judgment to pocket some receipts left in the Bronco, apparently thinking they might become valuable collector's items.
He failed to ponder that a celebrity case swarming with the nightmare hordes of justice would leave no receipt unpursued, so was caught.
He had worked many years for that towing company, he said.
And now, fired.
Another poor devil ruined for justice.
How many others?
Hardly a witness has escaped with character unsmeared, professional reputation untattered or dignity undestroyed.
This spectacle has solidified my determination, should I ever be called as a witness in any trial, to skip the country and take up residence in Brazil.

In both cases, sanctions against Japan were averted by an agreement that postponed much of the arguing until later.
And in both cases, the two nations offered different interpretations of the agreement.

2 Rappers, Soft and Hard
Rap has expanded far beyond its origins, adapting to any music with a beat.
A well-matched double bill brought 311, from Omaha and Los Angeles, and the Phunk Junkeez, from Phoenix, to the Academy on Thursday night.
Each band includes two rappers; they rhyme and sing to neo-hippie rock (311) or to harsher hard rock (the Phunk Junkeez), both geared to dancers.
During 311's set, Nicholas Hexum, a rapper, boasted about smoking marijuana in Amsterdam.
The music pulls together cannabis-compatible styles from Grateful Dead shuffles to Jamaican ska and dance-hall.
Verses are rapped, choruses sung, as 311's lyrics risk self-contradiction by trying to merge hip-hop cockiness with hippie benevolence.


Republican Gift Fraud
Senate Republican leaders have chosen an odd way to convince Americans they understand their disgust with Washington.
They are preparing to kill a strong gift-ban measure aimed at ending the legal bribery system that permits lobbyists and other special interests to bestow free meals, resort vacations and other gifts on lawmakers to buy legislative advantage in Congress.
More cynically, and with the consent of Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, they plan to substitute a more permissive measure designed by the G.O.P.'s crafty nemesis of political reform, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, that would perpetuate much of the old system under the guise of "reform."


Nation's Oldest Fun Park To Get a Brand New Look
For three summers, Lake Compounce has opened for just a few days in efforts to save its title as the nation's oldest continually operating amusement park.

But as it begins investing $35 million in new rides and attractions, the park faces the challenge of winning back patrons put off by the failures of two management companies over the last decade, a time when other amusement parks prospered.

Journal; Back To Camp
Every year the scene is so unchanging I could act it out in my sleep.
In front of the Hayden Planetarium on a muggy Saturday morning several dozen parents gather to wave goodbye to their boys as the bus ferries them off for eight weeks of camp.
First-time campers are clutchy.
Old-timers are cocky.
My own sons fret at length about carsickness.
Then the parents give the kids a final hug and shuffle sullenly back to their depopulated urban nests.
But not this year.
When the bus pushed out of the planetarium's circular driveway four Saturdays ago, at last removing the waving boys at the tinted windows completely from our view, one parent interrupted the usual hush by very tentatively starting to clap.
Then other parents joined in, first clapping and finally laughing -- uproariously.

Refurbished Digs Of the Iron Duke Evoke Art and War
Almost lost in the traffic that swirls around Hyde Park Corner, Apsley House has always looked forlorn and abandoned, an odd fate for the London home of the first Duke of Wellington in a land that still relishes his victory over Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815.
Donated to the nation by the Iron Duke's heirs in 1947, the late-Georgian mansion became the Wellington Museum in 1952, the 100th anniversary of his death.
But in recent years, even the inside of the house looked drab; the number of visitors fell off and its valuable art collection was forgotten.
Now, after a three-year closing, a $9.5 million refurbishment has restored the gilded interior of Apsley House to its former extravagant glory.
And with its paintings hanging where Wellington placed them, the museum reminds visitors anew of the age-old link between works of art and military conquest.

As the search for New York City's next schools chancellor begins in earnest, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the Board of Education inspire little confidence in the process.
They are squaring off like kids, drawing lines in the sandbox, when they should be actively collaborating to bring in the best possible leader for the nation's largest school system.
The task of finding a successor to Ramon Cortines would be challenging even without tensions between the board and City Hall.
Despite some impressive improvements in academic performance, the school system is plagued by uncertainty.
Teachers and other staff face the possibility of layoffs to help bridge the latest, $250 million gap in the board's budget.
School buildings are overcrowded and in a terrible state of disrepair.
The city's racial and ethnic divisions, as well as its gritty politics, complicate the search for a new leader.

In the first independent look at Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's new budget, the state agency that monitors New York City's finances concluded yesterday that the Mayor would have to do still more to keep the budget balanced, raising the specter of deeper cuts in services later in the year.
The agency, the Financial Control Board, said in its report that the Mayor's $31.1 billion budget relied too heavily on revenue and other factors that he cannot control.
While the Mayor has made great strides in reducing the city's payroll, the agency said, the city still faces "formidable challenges" and a potential budget gap of as much as $873 million because of several unrealistic assumptions.

Doubts About a Deal Maker; Are Westinghouse and Its Chief What CBS Needs?
After more than two years of dribbling, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation's chief executive, Michael H. Jordan, is about to take his big shot at revitalizing the struggling company.
Any day now, if all goes as planned, Westinghouse is expected to offer $5 billion for CBS Inc.
But, his name aside, there's little about this Michael Jordan that suggests this move will end in a slam-dunk.
The stands are full of doubters from Wall Street and the media industry, many of whom note that CBS, the last independent network, has been available for years without any takers at the $80 a share Westinghouse is prepared to pay.
True, Westinghouse would be buying a money-making business in CBS.
But CBS is a deeply troubled company that ranks last in the ratings among the three big television networks, and more than anything else it needs creative managers who can increase revenues.

Further documents provided by the department show that the message by the lawyer, David Margolis, was drafted as a hypothetical list of caustic questions that might be asked by news reporters, not as Mr.
Margolis's own complaints.
Other Department officials confirmed yesterday, however, that the list reflected Mr.
Margolis's anger over the way he believed the White House had interfered in the investigation.
Details and other developments appear today in an article on page 8.


The Town That Smiled
FOR all the bright lights and gleaming facades, all the jangle and bustle, all the billions the casinos have brought to the Boardwalk, Atlantic City's past is far more colorful than its present.
Glance at any of the old black-and-white photos in "Atlantic City: 125 Years of Ocean Madness," a 1979 book by Lee Eisenberg and Vicki Gold Levi, and you're transported to the smiling, giddy, silly time when Atlantic City was the busiest, most popular middle-class tourist resort on the East Coast.
Now in its third printing (Ten Speed Press), the book is still the standard reference for anyone who can't help wondering what things were like before legal gambling came to town.

Rare Birthday for Snowy Owls
The blessed event is supposed to take place 1,800 miles north, above the Arctic Circle.
But for the second year in a row, a snowy owl in New Jersey has become a mother.
Minnie, a mottle-chested, permanently disabled resident of the Raptor Trust here in Morris County, hatched a brood of four owlets last month.
Now six weeks old, the oversized fuzzballs are nearly a foot tall and already have wingspans of three feet.
They are not on display for the public.


Amy I. Liebowitz, Francois Cohas
Amy Ina Liebowitz, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Martin Liebowitz of East Setauket, L.I., was married yesterday evening to Francois Cohas, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Henri Cohas of Besancon, France.
Rabbi Dan Isaac performed the ceremony with the Rev.
Robert Smith, a Roman Catholic priest, at the Harmonie Club in New York.
Mrs.
Cohas, 28, is studying graphic design at European Graphic Design, a school in Paris.
She graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design.
Her mother is a genetic counselor for the Association for the Help of Retarded Children in Bohemia, L.I.
Her father is a professor of medicine and vice chairman of the department of medicine at the State University at Stony Brook, L.I.


'Yo!' From the Hip-Hop Hills

MENTION the Poconos and certain time-burnished images come to mind.
Hotel suites named Fantasia II.
Stock-car racing.
Candle factories and Christmas shops on Route 611 as it climbs to the town of Mount Pocono, sometimes called the honeymoon capital of the world.
But one image not likely to occur is this one: two African-American men, young musicians in hip-hop gear, bobbing to a ground-shaking beat in a recording studio.


LIVE AND LET DIE
Brickman's account of her father's death from stroke, while tragic for his family, should not represent the usual scenario.
Most stroke patients survive and have at least some improvement.
The reaction to the first symptoms should be to get help within minutes.
New drugs that may protect the brain from damage and improve blood flow are being tested, offering hope for significant recovery of function.
To be effective, these drugs must be given immediately after the onset of symptoms.
A campaign is being organized to alert the public to call 911 at the first symptom of a "brain attack." DARA G. JAMIESON, M.D.

Top Cuban-American Misuses U.S. Broadcasts, Officials Say
A Federal investigation into Radio Marti -- a Government-financed station that broadcasts to Cuba -- has found that the Cuban-American leader Jorge Mas Canosa improperly interfered with its operations, slanting its news coverage and influencing personnel decisions, officials familiar with the report said.
The report, prepared by the Inspector General of the United States Information Agency, details how Mr.
Mas has systematically interfered in Radio Marti's day-to-day operations and concludes that the radio station has improperly retaliated against employees who protested such manipulation by seeking to dismiss them, the officials said.


No Olympic Favors for Johnson

Horse Farm Holds Off Eviction
STANDING by the railing of the riding ring at the Prince Farms Equestrian Center in St.
James, watching her daughter Erin, 11, learn how to control her horse, Kathy McNeill breathed a sigh of relief.
Mrs.
McNeill had just heard that eviction proceedings against the 200-year-old horse farm had been postponed, at least until the season ends.
The camp would operate, and Erin, who had just started lessons, would attend for two weeks in August.


Two Little-Known Players Come to the Fore at the Big Apple Classic
Michelle McGann was the commanding leader midway through the JAL Big Apple Classic.
But today her hitherto flawless game went awry, and she was overtaken by two players, Carin Hjalmarsson and Tracy Kerdyk, from the lower echelon of women's professional golf.
Starting the day at Wykagyl Country Club with a four-stroke lead at eight-under-par 134, the 25-year-old McGann lost it in a hurry.
After reaching nine under with a birdie at No. 3, McGann incurred four bogeys over the next seven holes.
By the time she reached the turn she found herself tied for the lead by Hjalmarsson, a little-known 24-year-old from Sweden by way of the University of Tulsa.
By day's end, Hjalmarsson, in her first year on the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour, had fired a six-under 65 to stand at 205.
That gave her a one-stroke lead over Kerdyk going into Sunday's final round.
McGann finished today in a three-way tie for third place at 208, four strokes behind the leader.

What's Bill Got That Worked for John, Dick and Yes, Harry
Over the years, people have tried to predict market performance based on such factors as hemline lengths, baseball or football championships and the position of the stars in the sky.
Another favorite tactic is to correlate returns with presidential elections, which may not be so unreasonable after all.
Phoenix Investments, a fund and money management company in Hartford, noted in a recent study that stocks perform best in the third year of a presidential cycle, and the company encourages investors to get in the game before it's too late.


Streetscapes/Phelps Place; A Quiet Cul-de-Sac, Next to a Sleeping Giant
THE Victorian-era houses of Phelps Place, the leafy, picturesque little cul-de-sac in the St.
George section of Staten Island, are Vermont-quaint, the kind that make Manhattanites sigh, "If only we could live here."
But this is New York, where house restorers have to cope with more than just built-up paint and rotten porches -- for instance, the sprawling, derelict apartment complex nestling up against this innocent little street like Frankenstein cuddling a baby.
Before you cluck with sympathy, however, please note that the residents of Phelps Place find their neighbor as much a blessing as a blight.


Clinton Now Tries to Define Role for the U.S. in Bosnia
For Bill Clinton, this was the week to roll the dice on Bosnia yet one more time, as pressures at home and abroad combined to compel him to lay down his strongest threat so far in a bid to halt the Bosnian Serbs' advance without sinking American troops in a quagmire.
In a series of intense behind-the-scenes meetings in the White House and telephone calls to European leaders, Mr.
Clinton finally persuaded the NATO allies to threaten broad bombing strikes against the Serbs if they attacked the United Nations-designated "safe area" of Gorazde.

McNair and the Oilers Agree to Terms
STEVE McNAIR, Alcorn State's record-setting quarterback who was the No. 3 pick in the National Football League draft, has agreed to terms with the Oilers, Coach JEFF FISHER said yesterday after the first day of training camp at Trinity University.
"My understanding is they agreed in principle," Fisher said, adding he expects a deal to be signed and McNair to report to camp in a "couple of days." Terms of the deal were not disclosed.


Getting the Players Ready for Prime Time
CONSIDER what will happen a minute or two after 8 on Tuesday evening: The conductor Gerard Schwarz will enter from stage left, the way he always does.
The audience will applaud, the way it always does.
And the Mostly Mozart Orchestra will start playing, the way it always does.
Just another concert, right?
Wrong.
This one will be telecast on "Live From Lincoln Center" (Tuesday at 8 P.M. on Channel 13).
And though the 3,000 ticket holders in Avery Fisher Hall may not notice, it will be different.


What's Wrong With Idea Of a Trolley on 42d Street
To the Editor:
The bus is the unsung workhorse of urban America.
It makes totally efficient use of the space it takes up, requires no extraneous equipment like tracks or power lines and goes anywhere there is a paved surface.
I mention this because, as indicated in your July 16 article "Trying to Gauge Feasibility or Folly of 42d St. Trolley," New York may be about to spend hundreds of millions on a perfectly ridiculous project.

Natalie Merchant Steps Back From Rock's Cutting Edge
DURING HER 13 YEARS AS singer for 10,000 Maniacs, Natalie Merchant was the hippie chick of alternative rock.
She danced barefoot, sang about political issues in her folkie croon, espoused causes and was largely responsible for the Maniacs' reputation as the world's most politically correct band.
But two years ago, Ms.
Merchant abruptly declared that she was leaving the Maniacs to begin a solo career.
She hired a new manager, accountant, lawyer and band, and then recorded "Tigerlily," an album of straightforward soft rock that is an anomaly in a music scene in which reckless female performers reign supreme.


F.Y.I.
Daffydils of Old Q.  The old song "Lullaby of Broadway" contains the line "the daffydils that entertain/at Angelo's and Maxie's." What were the daffydils and where were Angelo's and Maxie's?
A.
First, the daffydils.
Joe Franklin, the former television host and a living encyclopedia of show-business trivia, says that daffydill was a "pet word for chorus girls" who often performed in the night clubs and restaurants with floor shows (known as "peacockeries," according to a 1935 article in the Times) that flourished in midtown after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.
Angelo's and Maxie's, on the other hand, may have been stretches of the imaginations of Al Dubin and Harry Warren, who wrote the song for a number in Busby Berkeley's 1935 movie musical "The Gold Diggers of 1935," about a party girl's fall from grace.
The song was resurrected for the 1980 musical "42d Street."
Mr.
Franklin said that while Angelo's might have referred to the 95-year old Italian restaurant on Mulberry Street, Maxie's was just a convenient fiction to provide a rhyme for the preceding line: "The rumble of the subway trains/the rattle of the taxis."
Irv Lichtman, deputy editor of Billboard and musical historian, agrees with Mr.
Franklin, though he thinks there might have been an Angelo's restaurant in midtown somewhere.
To further occlude the mystery, a 1935 phone directory actually lists a Maxie's restaurant at 109 Chrystie Street and an Angelo's restaurant at 160 Pearl Street.
The Story of Susan Q.  I see cabs all over town with bumperstickers that say "I Love Susan" or "Cruisin' with Susan." It can't be the same cab.
So who is Susan?
Does she have any idea she's so popular?
A.She better.
Her husband's the guy who's sticking them on the bumpers.
The stickers are on the herd of 130 cabs from Susan Maintenance, named after Susan Rattner.
She started the company with her husband, Malcolm, in 1982.
The "I Love Susan" stickers started about 5 years ago as Mr.
Rattner's expression of love, but quickly developed into a tagline for their fleet's drivers.
"Drivers would come in and say, "Let's go cruisin' with Susan," recalled Mr. Rattner.
The stickers turned out to be serendipitious.
"People slow down to read the sticker," said Mr.
Rattner.
"Our 'hit in the rears' went down 75 percent." Fountain Follies Q.  As a veteran Central Park runner, I've noticed that random water fountains are not being turned on, and in a few instances, are being uprooted entirely.
Park users count on the fountains to stave off dehydration, especially during these sweltering summer days.
What gives?
A.
The problem might be where you're running.
There are a grand total of 97 water fountains in Central Park (isn't it great that somebody's counting these things?) and 91 of them are "working perfectly," said Bradley Tusk, spokesman for the Parks Department.
Of the six that are down, four are on or near the North Meadow, with another dysfunctional spigot near West 106th Street and another leaky one west of the Great Lawn.
Mr.
Tusk says during the course of an average year, about one in every five fountains has to be repaired, which can mean temporary removal.
That's because vandals steal the bronze housings that cover the pipes, and the exposed pipes break.
Complaints about faulty fountains can be registered by calling (800) 201-7275.
Twisted Tracks?
Q.
The D train from uptown arrives at Rockefeller Center on the west track, and the F train from Queens on the east track.
Between there 42d Street the tracks cross, then at Broadway-Lafayette where the tracks cross again.
Why?
A.
It's easy to understand if you visualize the routes (hint: hands make great subway trains).
Facing downtown, the D comes into Rockefeller Center on the west (your right hand) because it's coming from the Upper West Side and the F comes in on the east (your left) because it's coming from Queens, said Termaine Garden, spokesman for the Transit Authority.
The D switches to the left tracks at 42d Street to run express, and the F goes to the right to service the local stops. (The express track actually runs under the local part of the way from 34th to West 4th.)
After Broadway-Lafayette, the F heads continues east under Houston Street while the D swings down, and to the right of the F to service Grand Street.

The Layoff Business: How Popular Is It?
The school board here in suburban Trenton is talking about getting rid of its staff of school janitors and maintenance workers and replacing them with cheaper services from commercial cleaning companies, and thereby hangs a wider tale about what is going on in New Jersey these days as Governor Whitman's cuts in taxes and controls on state spending work their way down from the capital to the local level.
The district, prosperous and middle class in a state full of prosperous, middle class places, has seen its state aid reduced by hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time when enrollments are once again creeping upward.
In earlier years, this pincer movement would have won a sympathetic ear from Trenton and from local taxpayers, who for a decade dutifully passed higher and higher school budgets while the Governor and Legislature down by the Delaware River, whether Republican or Democrat, also dutifully passed on higher and higher levels of state aid.


Claire Keller, Andrew Gallaher
Claire Elizabeth Keller, the daughter of Mary Carolyn and Alan B. Keller of Rye, N.Y., was married there yesterday to Andrew Welby Gallaher, the son of Sheila and Peter Gallaher of Nashua, N.H.
The Rev.
Dr.
Richard E. Murdoch performed the ceremony at the Rye Presbyterian Church.
Mrs.
Gallaher, 24, is the marketing coordinator for Capital Consulting and Research, a marketing research firm in New Canaan, Conn.
Her father is the deputy director of the African division of the United Nations Population Fund in New York.


THE NEW JAZZ AGE
Your celebration of the current directions in American jazz was a deserving recognition of our great music (June 25).
I must object, however, to Frank Conroy's lumping of all pre-be-bop-era jazz as "classical jazz or Dixie." The term Dixie evokes the image of the typical six-piece group, with the three front-line horns backed by a rhythm section playing polyphonic improvisations of "Tiger Rag" and "Muskrat Ramble."


Patient Files Go Electronic As Cost-Saver
Seeking to stem a blizzard of paperwork and raise medical standards, hospitals in the New York City metropolitan area are joining with three big nonprofit health insurance companies to develop a unified electronic information system for patient records.
The system, announced yesterday, would link hospitals, doctors' offices, nursing homes, home care agencies and pharmacies.
It would allow dozens of existing computer networks in hospitals and insurance companies to exchange information.
The sponsors say the program, which they maintain would save money, could help the regional health care system withstand pressures from Washington and Albany as well as from managed health care plans to reduce costs.


Medicare, Turning 30, Won't Be What It Was
Thirty years after its creation, Medicare celebrates its anniversary this summer as a rare creature in the politics of the 1990's: a big, ambitious, exceedingly popular Government program that worked.
Nevertheless, it stands on the brink of extraordinary change.


On Sunday; Will It Be 'Eh? Just Another One?'
JOSEPHINE DORSAINVIL was, first and foremost, a mom.
Her pride in the accomplishments of her five grown children was so fierce and unabashed that once, when a co-worker questioned her assertion that she had a daughter at Harvard, Mrs.
Dorsainvil brought the teen-ager, who was home from college on a break, onto the factory floor the next day just to shut the guy up.
She had come to New York from Haiti 25 years ago, taken a job in a Long Island factory that made plastic bags and began laying the foundation for a new life for her family in New Cassel, a working-class enclave in central Nassau County that is home to many Haitian emigres.
Two years later, she was joined here by her husband, Pierre, a soft-spoken carpenter from Arcahaie (pronounced Ar-ca-YE), the small rural village 20 miles northwest of Port-au-Prince where they had both grown up.
And three years after that came a reunion with their three children (twin daughters, Cynthia and Dolores, were born later) who had been living with relatives in Arcahaie.

The Breakaway Kingdom
THE JEWISH WAR By Tova Reich. 270 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $22.


Correction
An article on July 9 about theatrical and film versions of "Show Boat" and "Sunset Boulevard" misstated the dates for the opening of the first Broadway version of "Show Boat" and for the release of the second film version of "Show Boat." The opening was in 1927, not 1928; the release was in 1951, not 1956.
In addition, the article misidentified the opening song of "Show Boat." It is "Cotton Blossom," not "Ol' Man River." A picture caption with the article misidentified a scene from a "Show Boat" film.
It was a from the 1951 version, not the 1936 one.


A Prison Empire: How It Grew -- A special report.; Parlaying the Detentions Business Into Profit
In the 1980's, James Slattery and Morris Horn ran one of the most notorious welfare hotels in New York City, the filthy, crime-ridden and profitable Brooklyn Arms in Fort Greene.
After the city closed the hotel in 1989, Mr.
Slattery and Mr.
Horn, with no experience in the prison business, bid to open a Federal halfway house in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Residents protested, and Representative Edolphus Towns began an investigation of the contract.
But Mr.
Slattery and Mr.
Horn hired Mr.
Towns's campaign manager, who lobbied the neighborhood and the politicians for them.
The opposition melted.
They got the contract for their new prison company because, just as the city had been desperate for places to house the homeless, the Federal Bureau of Prisons badly needed a place for former offenders in New York City.


Why Some Are Switching to Nursing
WHY do people with one college degree leave good jobs to plunk down $25,000 for tuition so they can study tirelessly for 16 months in order to get a degree in nursing?
Ask the 20 students enrolled in the College of New Rochelle's accelerated bachelor of science and nursing program, and the answers are as diverse as the students themselves.


Clinton at Odds With Gingrich Once Again
When President Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich appeared together at a senior citizens picnic in New Hampshire last month, news accounts suggested that the event might have signaled a new era in political civility.
The President and the Speaker treated each other cordially and even shook hands on a proposal to consider changes in the regulation of lobbying and campaign donations.


Lessons Learned in School-Work Link
WITH a practiced hand and steady eye, David Ferrer examined a group of test tubes containing blood samples to be checked for Lyme disease at the county's Department of Laboratories and Research here.
Such procedures are standard for technicians in laboratories, but David is no ordinary technician.
A recent graduate of White Plains High School, he was earning science credit through his school district's School-to-Work program, part of a recently begun national initiative to aid students' transition from school to the workplace.


Learning Disabled
THE APOSTLES OF SCIENTIFIC literacy are fond of listing important scientific concepts that every child ought to know and that, of course, most adults don't.
Those who feel bad about not having the definition of junk DNA or Bose-Einstein-condensate at their fingertips may take comfort from a new book that argues that scientific literacy is an impossible and unnecessary goal.
The ideal of making every citizen literate in science has been pushed by scientists who want an appreciative audience for their achievements, says the science educator Morris Shamos in "The Myth of Scientific Literacy," published last month.
In his view only people seeking careers as scientists need struggle through a full-blown science curriculum; the rest should be taught science "as a cultural imperative, and not primarily for content."


The Nation; How Affirmative Action Got So Hard to Sell
NOT so long ago, the arithmetic of American civil rights was kindergarten-simple: black people, at least most of them, were the oppressed class, and whites, a good many of them, were the oppressors.
America added a and b, found the sum abhorrent, and in 1965 factored in a revolutionary new x.
It was called affirmative action.
Voila! Differential calculus. Today, we can all feel oppressed.

Mr. Murdoch Goes To Washington
A WEEK from Tuesday, Rupert Murdoch is scheduled to appear before the House ethics committee, where he will be grilled by Democrats about his company's lucrative book deal with the Republican House Speaker, Newt Gingrich.
Over on the House floor that week, perhaps even that same day, Republican lawmakers will be trying to push through a major telecommunications bill that would, among other things, let the media baron buy still more television stations and newspapers in the United States.
In one sense, this is all in a week's notoriety for Mr.
Murdoch -- a man fiercely admired by some as a brilliant entrepreneur and just as fiercely reviled by others as a harsh and domineering mogul.
But the simple fact of this double-barreled, center-stage presence in Congress also represents a new phase in a remarkable career: After years as an outsider in the capital's whirl of money and politics, Mr.
Murdoch has come to Washington.


July 16-22: Good Ol' Boys; Militiamen Crash A Lawmen's Party
Out in the boondocks of Polk County, an all-white neck of the Tennessee woods, hundreds of Federal, state and local law-enforcement officers from all over gathered each spring to gorge on beer and barbecue, play country music and have a good old-fashioned hog wallow.
Now an Alabama militia group has gone and spoiled it all.
The militia men, who hate certain Federal agencies for enforcing gun laws, infiltrated last May's Good Ol' Boys Roundup with a videotape camera.
There were racist T-shirts and paraphernalia on display, they said.
A skit involving Ku Klux Klan garb and a "slave," and a sign briefly posted at the entrance to the 1990 roundup bearing the words "Nigger Checkpoint" all are part of the accusations.


Weeds? Sure. Plenty Of Them.
IN spite of the dry soil and soaring temperatures, some plants are getting along just fine this summer.
They are called weeds.
These particular plants are quite clever.
They huddle near ornamentals as if to disguise themselves, or worse, they grow so close in and under favored plants that they are sometimes not seen.

Are America's Wide Open Spaces Too Big for the Small Screen?
HERE's the idea: five young people who have never met board a Winnebago and set off across the country.
Every few days, they get a new clue -- in a pouch around a dog's neck, for example -- that presents them with a new destination and a new challenge, like working at an alligator farm or parachuting out of a plane.
Their adventures, their fights, their accomplishments and their whining -- in short their every move -- is recorded by video cameras.
This is the idea behind "Road Rules," a new MTV series on Monday nights at 10 for the next 13 weeks.
The show draws most obviously on its MTV predecessor "The Real World," a series that put a group of nubile strangers together in a house for several weeks of on-air angst.
But there is also a strong allusion to a more venerable, if often underappreciated television tradition: the road show.
"Road Rules" is "Route 66" with better outfits and more sex.


New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks
D-Day, June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II By Stephen E. Ambrose.
Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $16.
Drawing on 1,200 oral histories, the author examines the strategy behind the landings at Normandy and re-creates the scene where Allied troops triumphed, but at a terrible cost.
Last year our reviewer, Raleigh Trevelyan, wrote, "The descriptions of individual ordeals on the bloody beach . . . make this book outstanding."


Truckers Carve a New Route, Crowding a Two-Lane Road
It seemed like some kind of long-distance magic trick.
In November 1993, transportation officials cut the ribbon on the last link of Interstate 287 in northern Passaic County.
Fifty miles away, on the other side of the state, tractor-trailers began to inundate a two-lane road.
But what happened is not really much of a mystery.
The completion of I-287 created a toll-free alternative to the New Jersey Turnpike for north- and southbound interstate truckers, a route that includes a nine-mile stretch of Route 31 in Hunterdon and Mercer Counties.
The 287 link, coupled with several more recent road projects authorized by the state, more than tripled truck traffic along the two-lane portion of Route 31 within 18 months, from 900 trucks a weekday to more than 3,000 a day in March.


Yankee Owner Praises And Rips
Concerned with the growing impression that he is trying to force Don Mattingly out of New York after this season and aware of the potential public relations damage the action could cause, George Steinbrenner complimented the most popular Yankee profusely yesterday while also denying the assertion that he wants the team captain to go elsewhere.
But Danny Tartabull was not treated so delicately by the Boss.
When Steinbrenner was finished comparing Mattingly to Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio, he continued to ridicule the disgruntled Tartabull and charged that the designated hitter is faking a rib-cage injury because he does not want to be booed at Yankee Stadium.
The Yankee owner also challenged General Manager Gene Michael and Manager Buck Showalter to publicly voice the derogatory comments about Tartabull he said they constantly air during staff meetings.


Crooning to Fight AIDS, Changing to Beat the Heat
UPTOWN -- Chris Isaak sounded a lot nicer than a dog howling at the moon, at the Beacon Theater on July 13, but his voice did have that middle-of-the-night-and-I'm-all-alone quality.
This handsome singer from San Francisco, whose new album, "Forever Blue," is about being dumped by his girlfriend, was pouring his heart out for Lifebeat, a music-industry organization fighting AIDS.


In the Editing Room, Many Propose, Few Dispose
"HOW DO WE SOLVE THE problem here?" says Richard Halsey.
It is May 12, and the 55-year-old Academy Award winner and film editor is brainstorming over a few seconds of film he wants to insert under the opening credits of "The Net." Wearing blue jeans, a khaki shirt and two earrings, he is manically snapping his fingers, pacing in his black high tops across a temporary editing room in Manhattan that has the dimensions and spare decorating scheme of a three-car garage.
For seven weeks, Mr.
Halsey will spend his waking hours here, editing the $22 million techno-thriller starring the 30-year-old Sandra Bullock.
"The Net," which opens on Friday, is about Angela, a reclusive computer systems analyst who has to hack her way out of trouble after she meets a man (Jeremy Northam) in Mexico and all of her personal computer records are erased.

Our kids have too much smut thrown at them every day without adding another source.
If users persist, drop them from the service.

If Your Thinking of Living In/Marble Hill; A Bit of Manhattan in the Bronx
YES, you have crossed the Harlem River and, yes, that is the northern tip of Manhattan island that you can see to the south.
But as residents of Marble Hill are quick to point out, you are not in the Bronx: because of a 19th-century public works project that reshaped Manhattan island and severed its topmost land, Marble Hill is across the river and into what logically should be the Bronx.
It is a quirky and little-known neighborhood whose residents consider it a well-kept secret.
Where else in Manhattan can you find a six-bedroom, three-story house on a quiet, tree-lined street with an attic, a basement, an enclosed front porch and a pretty facade for sale for $174,000?
Or a three-family house with six bedrooms on an architecturally magnificent street with an asking price of $295,000?


The World; Chirac Dusts Off An 'Idea of France'
CARDINAL RICHELIEU, Talleyrand, and Charles de Gaulle were all masters of diplomatic leverage, multiplying French influence in the councils of the world and sometimes turning defeat into victory, skills the French admire in their leaders.
Jacques Chirac, an admirer of de Gaulle who was elected President a little more than two months ago, has clearly learned a lot from his predecessors.


Liberties; The Vicuna Lacuna
Al D'Amato's impersonation of a statesman made my head hurt.
And hanging on the words of Howell Heflin was not my idea of how to spend a steamy Friday afternoon.
But accountability of government is a pillar of our democracy.
So I went to hearings all week, and watched Congressional panels on Whitewater, Waco and the Good Ol' Boys Roundup, the racist A.T.F. picnic.


Sophisticated Food in Rustic Ambiance
THE Downtown Grille fuses the rustic laid-back ambiance of Montauk and the sophisticated food of points west.
One noteworthy point west is 107 Forest in Locust Valley, which has the same ownership.
Although Montauk experienced a large influx of stylish new restaurants last season, the four-year-old Downtown Grille met the challenge.
It still serves the best food in town.


TRADE SECRETS: Where Sushi Comes From
Sushi season (catching it) begins off Cape Cod in late June when the highly prized bluefin tuna arrive.
Boats work with spotter planes.
If the pilot spots a fish that the boat captures, he generall receives 25 percent of the proceeds.
Some of the best tuna is taken by boats equipped with harpoons that shock the fish to death.
If the fish fights for some time, the struggle raises the temperature of the flesh, giving the tuna and unwanted quality the Japanese call ya-ke.


Margaret Groarke, Jordan Moss
Margaret M. Groarke, the daughter of Stephen and Bernadette Groarke of the Bronx, and Jordan Bernard Moss, a son of Jay and Sabina Moss of Cedarhurst, L.I., were married yesterday at the chapel of Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
The Rev.
Leslie J. Ivers performed the ceremony, in which Rabbi Burt Aaron Siegel took part.
Ms.
Groarke, who is 33 and is keeping her name, is a doctoral candidate in political science at the City University of New York Graduate Center and is an adjunct instructor of political science at Lehman College in the Bronx.
She graduated cum laude from Harvard University.
Her father retired as a supervisor of carpenters for the New York City Housing Authority.
Her mother is the secretary in the housing office of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.


Fight for Parking at Beaches Grows More Intense
SOMETIMES the cars wait in line up to the top of that hill," said Joe Disunno, who parks cars at the Atlantic Avenue Beach in Amagansett. He pointed to where Atlantic Avenue intersects with Bluff Road.
The lot has room for 195 cars, and across the road an additional 70 can line up diagonally, to conserve space.

Crime Lab; Mystery of New York, the Suddenly Safer City
NEW YORK CITY'S murder, robbery and burglary rates have plummeted to their lowest levels in a quarter century -- a development that has become a marvel of American law enforcement.
But Police Commissioner William J. Bratton will not be satisfied until every last criminologist surrenders.
"We'll knock them down like ducks in a row," said Mr.
Bratton, speaking of all the standard criminological theories about how crime waves are tied to the size of the youth population, or to changes in the weather, or to unemployment levels, or to drug use patterns, or to the availability of guns.


The Life and Times Of a Young Rock Band
IT was one of the first warm nights of this cold dark spring.
Sri Kesava, a.k.a.
Kim Shopov, the pigtailed lead singer of Baby Gopal, was pacing a Brooklyn club, as nervous as a teen-ager giving her first really hip and life-defining party.
Ignoring her, a bartender in a "Stupid Is as Stupid Does" T-shirt and an old Polish man ate fried chicken out of Styrofoam containers at the bar.
Their chomping on wings and drumsticks appeared undisturbed by the sounds from the black hole of the back room.
From behind the gold brocade curtains drifted the band State of Execution's acknowledgement of thanks to "everyone who came down to see us." As recompense the band promised to open up with its song "Whore" for the 30 or so present.
The refrain was a predictable "she's a" over and over.
A handful of black T-shirted, shaved heads slammed into each other, moshing and snacking from canisters of Pringles potato chips to keep their energy fueled.
For Sri, things were messing up.
She and her band had arrived at the show about an hour late.
They had apparently been driving around the hinterlands of Greenpoint for some time, perhaps even catching cruel, taunting glimpses of the isle of Manhattan, where they would really rather be playing instead of being ironically relegated to the 996 Club on Manhattan Avenue.
Nonetheless, jumpy and swigging from a bottle of imported water, Sri made her way to the sound and light man, who seemed to have had some power over the doings, and she gamely jockeyed for a spot sooner rather than later among Sour, Pittfall, Struggle Within, Nemenon and State of Execution.


Fond Memories
To the Editor:
James R. Oestreich's article "At Peace in the Lonely Realm of the Oboe"  [ July 9 ]  brought back memories of the week I spent in the Little Switzerland, N.C., retreat known as Wildacres, where I attended a "camp" for saxophonists.

"You can tell who's going to come in and go straight to Hello Kitty," Ms.
Sekaran said.
"It's typically the people who are dressed up in vinyl with the little hearts on the T-shirts. Pink vinyl is just key."

The World; Does Japan Still Need Its Scary Monster?
LIKE many of his generation in Japan, he paid dearly for the aggressive impulses that had killed millions of people and left cities in ruin.
Like them, he was also a victim of the terrible dawn of the atomic age, and then of the cold war.
In recent years, he had been concerned with protecting Japan from environmental disasters as well as economic competitors, but those urges came with powerful doses of violence.
Yes, Godzilla was a troubled, complex creature. He was also a creature of his times.


The Endurance Tony
IF Cal Ripken Jr. can hold out, baseball will celebrate his record-breaking 2,131st consecutive game on Sept. 6.
That night Bryan Hull, a different kind of iron horse, will set his own longevity record.
The gray-haired 57-year-old will make tea in his Hudson Street apartment and walk it over to the Sullivan Street Playhouse.
By 8:25 P.M. he'll be on its tiny oval stage as the old actor in "The Fantasticks." Makeup lining his face, a spotlight catching the wisps of white hair falling from his wig, he'll say with a creaky urgency that seems utterly of the moment: "Sir, the players have arrived."


Rent Hike Set at Waterside, to the Chagrin of Both Tenants and Developer
Last week, the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development approved a rent increase at Waterside Plaza, the 1,100-unit Mitchell-Lama apartment complex that sits on a concrete platform over the East River.
Neither tenant organizers nor the developer is thrilled.
As of Aug. 1, tenants will pay an additional $36 per room each month.
Rents will go up another $4.02 per room each month on Aug. 1, 1996, and another $4.03 per room on Aug. 1, 1997.
Rents, which include utilities, had not increased in a decade, except on vacant apartments.


Crackdown on Illegal Housing Collides With a Tradition of Helping Others
Last December, fire raced through a crowded single-family house in Orange that had been illegally divided into at least three apartments.
Fire officials are still not sure how many people were living there -- they say at least 17 -- but 9 died in the flames, their efforts to escape thwarted at least in part by the lack of fire exits.
Since that blaze, and another one three weeks later in nearby Irvington that killed 3 of the 18 inhabitants of a one-family house, officials in several communities have cracked down on illegal apartments and rooming houses.

Safety in Italy
To the Editor
A few words in defense of one of the most beautiful areas of Italy -- Apulia, the region that forms the heel and spur of the boot.
Our last trip to Italy took us to Rome, Naples and Apulia.
We spent three delightful weeks and never had a problem -- people were incredibly kind and helpful and seemed to go out of their way for us.
In Naples I was reminded to take off my jewelry by a cafe owner.
On a number of occasions people took us to our hotel instead of giving directions.


For Aspiring Champions, It's an Uphill Jump All the Way
Last winter, Sydne Vogel came from Alaska to skate in the Lower 48, and the questions her adolescent competitors asked were as amusing as they were uninformed.
Do you skate on icebergs? Do you live in an igloo?


Sharing a Saint: The 2 Worlds of Our Lady of Mount Carmel
In East Harlem last Saturday, nearly 1,000 worshipers clutching votive candles followed a float for two hours bearing a larger-than-life statue of Madonna and child and six girls in lacy Communion dresses.
Eight men in white tuxedos pulled the float, pausing to watch fireworks set off every few blocks and catch their breath in the still, nearly 100-degree air that grew heavier with the smell of gunpowder.
The crowd was gathered for a two-day celebration of the feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which is no ordinary ethnic event, but street religion New York style.
It's an Italian immigrant festival dating to the 19th century that now takes place in El Barrio and is dominated by Haitians who chant to the Madonna in French Creole.


Francie Randolph, Thomas Watson
Penelope Frances Randolph, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Evan Randolph 4th of Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., was married last evening to Thomas Aldren Dingman Watson, a son of Nancy Dingman Watson of Truro, Mass., and Aldren Watson of West Hartland, Vt.
The Rev.
Leland Wilkinson, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony on the dunes in Truro.
The bride, who is 30 and is known as Francie, owns R Design, a graphic design company in Cambridge, Mass.
She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University, where she is a candidate for a master's degree in visual education.
Her father is the executive vice president at B &amp; B Marketing, an advertising agency in Wellesley, Mass.
Her mother, Penelope Dixon Randolph, teaches English at the Glen Urquhart School in Beverly Farms, Mass.


Some Familiar Faces, From Foreign Places
IN spite of the dry soil and soaring temperatures, some plants are getting along just fine this summer.
They are called weeds.
These particular plants are quite clever.
They huddle near ornamentals as if to disguise themselves, or worse, they grow so close in and under favored plants that they are sometimes not seen.


Connecting the Dots On an Italian Coastline
The Via dell'Amore, the path between two of the five villages that make up the Cinque Terre on the northwest coast of Italy, has reopened after having been closed for five years.
A favorite haunt of lovers, as its name suggests, the path was cut off by a landslide in August 1990.
It lies between the two southernmost villages, medieval Riomaggiore, founded in the seventh century, and Manarola, set on terraced vineyards.
Although the path is only a few yards wide and half a mile long, the reconstruction took five years because money was tight and because one section had to be enclosed in a tunnel as protection against landslides.


A Classic Tale Springs From the Cupboard
Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home  Jason James Richter, Michael Madsen, Jayne Atkinson, Francis Capra Directed by Dwight Little PG 98 minutes
Willy, last seen leaping to freedom in the 1993 boy-and-his-whale movie "Free Willy," returns with his family.
Jesse, the street child who befriended him, is now a teen-ager living with his foster parents, though he still misses his mother, who abandoned him.
He gets the news that she has died and that he has a half-brother, Elvis, a smart-aleck pipsqueak.
Elvis moves in, the whales are threatened by an oil spill, and the boys bond when they risk their lives to save them.


Connecticut Q&amp;A: Adelma Grenier Simmons; Flavor, Fragrance, Medicine and Magic
SOWN into the rockbound earth of Coventry in Connecticut's northeast corner is a patch of aromatic acreage, Caprilands Herb Farm.
Its creator, the author and educator Adelma Grenier Simmons, has embroidered more than 35 herbal gardens into an estate dedicated to the herb in all its varieties.
She is the author of more than 48 books on herbs, their history and literature and is working on another, called "The Education of a Gardener," meant to start would-be gardeners off in the right direction.


Hero to the Bad and Truly Awful
NO SADDER SPECTACLE CONFRONTS the music reviewer than bare, earnest adequacy in the service of large ambition.
One notes the years of labor, the expenditure of spiritual and material resources, the hopes and the vanities and realizes that a young lifetime has been sacrificed to meager results.
One writes respectfully about such events and usually only once.
Very bad concerts can be as instructive as very good ones.
Singers are usually involved, for no art is more personal or more visceral, nor does any other offer as many opportunities for self-deception.
If singers believe they are good and are actually terrible, one simply goes home and writes nothing.

Guarding the Turf, Stepping on Toes; Henry Stern, Passionate and Blunt, Champions the City Parks
There is a certain "Car 54, Where Are You?" quality to careering about the boroughs with Henry J. Stern, New York City's odd duck of a Parks Commissioner, who over two recent days fielded calls from his chauffered Crown Victoria about the mini-crises that roll through a job he would happily keep for life.
He bristled at news that a sulking corporate donor wants a larger sign in Central Park advertising its largesse: "They're trying to push us," he said into the car phone.
"If they're so noble, what do they care if the letters are an inch and a quarter high?"

Dividing Palestine
To the Editor:
Morton A. Klein (letter, July 16) writes that the League of Nations defined Palestine as including the Kingdom of Jordan; hence Arabs already have three-fourths of Palestine.
He omits that Palestinian Muslims and Christians made up 90 percent of the population in 1920, and that they should have been allowed (as promised) self-determination.


Dana Schragen, Michael Runyon
Dana Marlo Schragen, a daughter of Laurie Schragen of Mahwah, N.J., and Jerald Schragen of Ramsey, N.J., was married last evening to Michael Brad Runyon, a son of Nancy Scheriff and Guy Runyon, both of Saddle River, N.J.
Rabbi Howard Shapiro performed the ceremony at the Essex House, in New York.
Mrs.
Runyon, 24, graduated from Ithaca College.
She was formerly a meeting planner for the Calvin Klein Cosmetics Company in New York.
Her mother, a real estate broker, is also the manager of the Ramsey office of Coldwell Banker Schlott, real estate agents.
Her father is a lawyer in Ramsey.


DEATH ON THE CNN CURVE
IT WAS FAME that killed Robert O'Donnell, killed him as surely as that shotgun blast he fired into his brain on a dark, dusty, West Texas road, miles and years away from the thing that made him famous in the first place.
Technically, it was the bullet that did it -- a .410 shell, the kind his mother kept at the ranch house to shoot rattlesnakes and warn trespassers.
It certainly wasn't an accident.
You can't shoot yourself in the mouth accidentally with a .410.
The barrel is too long.
And it wasn't someone else's doing.
He left three notes, lined up side by side by the coffee table, two to his two boys and one that simply said, "No help from nobody but family."
So it was the bullet, or depression, or his willful trigger finger that caused his death, this spring, at the age of 37.
But the reason he did it, and the reason no one who knew him was surprised, that is where the fame comes in.
Eight years earlier he had saved a little girl's life, as the whole world watched, and, for a while, he was the center not only of his small universe, but of the real, known universe, the new one that sees everything simultaneously on CNN.
There was a parade, countless television appearances, a letter from the president, a handshake from the Vice President, a made-for-TV movie.
But eventually, the cameras went away, the world's attention moved on and he was left alone -- a man so changed by fame that he no longer belonged in his world, but not changed enough that he could leave that world behind.

WITH its sharply conservative editorial page and what some readers say is a liberal bent in its news coverage, The Wall Street Journal may be the most famously divided newspaper in journalism.


Politics of Payback: Clinton Offers Aid to Virginia Ex-Governor
In a move some view as payback for an endorsement that helped Democrats to a rare election triumph last fall, President Clinton and Virginia's Democratic Senator have agreed to assist a former opponent, L. Douglas Wilder, in retiring his campaign debts.
President Clinton agreed this week to head the receiving line when the Senator, Charles S. Robb, , holds a party next month to reduce the debt Mr.
Wilder amassed in his four-month campaign for the 1992 Democratic Presidential nomination and in his independent bid last year for Mr.
Robb's seat.


Lisa M. DiLallo, Thomas R. Clark
Lisa Margaret DiLallo, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Joseph DiLallo of Summit, N.J., was married there yesterday to Thomas Richard Clark, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Richard Clark of Short Hills, N.J.
The Rev.
Thomas G. Arminio performed the ceremony at St.
Theresa of Avila Roman Catholic Church.
Mrs.
Clark, 29, is the coordinating producer of "Moneyline" report on CNN in New York.
She graduated from the University of Arizona.
Her father is an internist specializing in geriatrics in Summit.
Her mother, Lilita DiLallo, retired as a biochemist from the Stritch School of Medicine at Loyola University in Chicago.


Diehard Drinkers Hail the Return of the Idiot
Glenn Wernig was drunk this St.
Patrick's Day and has only hazy memories of the grand reopening of the Village Idiot at its new 14th Street and Ninth Avenue site.
But he does recall a poster announcing the rebirth of this proudly raunchy bar.
It read: "Legends never die."
Although the old Idiot, as people call it, closed in 1993 after seven years on First Avenue and 10th Street, Mr.
Wernig included it in his 1994 guide to Lower East Side bars, "Having a Hell of a Time." Then, the 33-year-old artist wrote, "R.I.P. I miss the Village Idiot!"


They'll Bring Tears to Your Eyes
THERE are going to be lots of peppers this year.
Thirty-six varieties of sweet, 130 varieties of hot.
Varieties from Zimbabwe, Turkey, Thailand, Gambia.
Sixty-five varieties from Latin America alone.
Bird peppers -- peppers whose seeds must pass through the digestive system of a bird to shed their hulls and germinate.
And this year, for the first time, an incendiary device called the Red Savina, hundreds of times as hot as the jalapeno.
The peppers are growing in neat rows at Oak Grove Plantation, Ted and Susan Blew's 160-acre farm in the gentle hills of Hunterdon County.
The farm is organic, profitable, diverse and growing -- a leading supplier of peppers to consumers and merchants through the vast Union Square Greenmarket in Manhattan.
How it got that way is a story about family farmers coping in a time of agribusiness combines and real-estate development -- about finding a niche and building it.


Mall Proposal Pits Residents Against Builder
WHEN Anthony Patone was courting the woman he would later marry, he often walked with her along the village streets that climb from the Hudson River here, sharing plans for their future and dreams of opening a small business in the quaint downtown.
In the 11 years since they met, those dreams have come true, and Mr.
Patone and his wife, Joyce, now own two video stores, one on the main street here and another in nearby Irvington.
Peter N. Rockwood was also charmed by the village and moved here 20 years ago, leaving a marketing job in Manhattan to sell fine wines in the spot where the first Westchester liquor store opened after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.
He left the wood floors and tin ceiling of the old store intact, and although the business has "not been a runaway success," he said, "I've put my kids through college, made a good living and lived a good life."


French Intellectuals Wanted Truth Told
To the Editor:
In "French War Stories" (Op-Ed, July 19), Tony Judt goes so far in praising President Jacques Chirac for finally admitting French Government complicity in the deaths of 76,000 Jews during the Nazi occupation, and in attacking the French left, that he seriously distorts history.


Big, Expensive and Finally Here


Hasty Puddings
Summer puddings exploit the ooze factor of summer fruit.
That red splotch staining the raspberry container, or the indigo tears at the bottom of the blueberry box, can be elevated and exaggerated, raised to a near art form, when soft summer fruit is baked under a cookie crust or thinly sliced bread.
Given normal circumstances, berries and nectarines, peaches and plums need no intervention.
They are perfect unto themselves, best served as they are bought or found.
The cook might add some cream, or some gelato, but for the most part, summer fruit speaks for itself.


Irish Government Will Try Again to Lift Nation's Divorce Ban
The Irish Government has decided to press for the removal of Ireland's constitutional ban on divorce in a national referendum later this year, officials said Friday.
If the Government campaign succeeds, it will mean that overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Ireland, the only European Union country that still prohibits divorce, would permit it for the first time.
Removing the ban would also make it possible for the thousands of Irish who have obtained foreign divorces to remarry in this country.

Sweet, Cold Frenzy in the Hood
MAKING ice cream is just like making a cake, explains Robbie Guyette, the first-shift production supervisor at the H. P. Hood plant in Suffield.
You start off with a mixing bowl, stir in your ingredients and pop it away to finish it off.
But Mr.
Guyette's mixing bowl is a 1,000-gallon stainless steel tank, and his ingredient list starts with 4,000 pounds of milk, 2,400 pounds of cream and a half-ton of sugar.
This is the busy season for Hood's ice cream division off Route 159, a 142,450-square-foot building (with a smiling Harry Hood painted on the front) that opened 30 years ago this summer.
It was the biggest in North America when it opened, and still ranks among the largest, producing 21 million gallons of ice cream each year.
Two shifts a day work at full speed to meet summer demand for everything from Hoodsie cups, the plant's oldest product (introduced in 1946), to Celestial Seasonings frozen tea pops, introduced within the last year.


CHATTER: Censor the Internet; Paying for It
What, if anything, should be done to limit sexually explicit material on the Internet?
Anyone who uses a $2,000 computer to get pictures that are available for a buck and a half at the corner gas station is at least a few pepperonis shy of a full pizza.

Death Urged for Rootless Killer
A stealthy strangler that sucks the life from its victims like a vampire is on a silent, deadly rampage in Bryant Park.
Or at least in the ivy bed in the park's northwest corner.
The villain is cuscuta, more commonly known as dodder.
Its aliases are more ominous, and, according to horticulturalists, more apt: devil's sewing thread and hell bind.


BEHIND THE WHEEL/Chevrolet Suburban, Tahoe and Blazer; Sibling Rivalry in Chevy's Rugged Clan
IF Goldilocks still liked to wander in the woods, Chevrolet showrooms could offer her at least as many off-roading choices as she found on that storied day she came across the bears.
There is the Suburban, the papa bear of four-wheel-drive light trucks; the Blazer, the smallish but feisty sport utility that was redesigned for this year, and now the Tahoe, which is meant to fill the gap in between.


July 16-22: Question of Sanctions; Saddam Hussein Gets No Respect For a Prisoner Release
Saddam Hussein released two Americans who had been held prisoner in Iraq for four months, but the Clinton Administration took the view last week that no thanks were due: David Daliberti and William Barloon, the officials felt, were being let go merely as part of a charm offensive to persuade the world to lift economic sanctions.
Mr.
Daliberti and Mr.
Barloon, who work for American aircraft maintenance companies in Kuwait, were arrested March 13 after crossing into Iraq.
The Iraqis said they entered illegally; the two said they had made a wrong turn.


Haunting 'Splendora' at Bay Street Theater, Honoring Finesse and Surprise
IN Splendora, a dinky make-believe Texas town defined by corruption, ineptitude and budget cuts, an extravagant young woman and a mysterious young man appear one hot summer day, as if out of a storybook past.
In the prologue of a haunting new musical produced by the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor, five busybodies in the town square are singing of Miss Jessica Gatewood, remembered.
They evoke the time when she arrived from New Orleans to "put the splendor back in Splendora," by buying house that was once a model of Victoriana, with dolls and knickknacks everywhere.
But "fire ate up her flesh," the gossips tell us about the fate of "Miss Jessie." Whatever happened to her companion, Timothy John, who disappeared without a trace, is left to the imagining.


July 16-22: Zenith Sells; Koreans Buy the Last U.S.-Owned TV Maker
There was an air of inevitability about the decision last week by Zenith Electronics, the last American-owned television manufacturer, to sell control of the company to LG Electronics, a giant Korean competitor.
Zenith was simply too small to compete in the global business of consumer electronics and too strapped for cash to get big in a hurry.
At the same time, the company's reputation for quality and its patents in technologies like high-definition television were assets that management could sell to the highest bidder.
The takeover might have come sooner but for fears of a consumer backlash against whichever foreign company bought the last American entrant in an industry the United States invented.


July 16-22; Instrument of Crime?


A Little Giverny, a Lot of Culinary Skill
RESIDENTS of Fairfield would probably like to keep La Colline Verte a secret.
New as it is, the French restaurant is so so busy that reservations are essential.
The tiny space is jewel-like, with lemon walls, deep blue banquettes, rush-seated wood chairs with yellow backs and the same blue trim: the colors of the dining room in Claude Monet's Giverny.
The ceiling is a blue sky with clouds.
A mural evokes a van Gogh cafe in Arles.


In Hip-Hop Heaven


The Figure From 12 Earnest Viewpoints
THE 12 photographers in "Traces," on view at the Bronx Museum of the Arts here, focus on the figure but in ways that make it a pretext for the show rather than its subject.
This results in an earnest atmosphere, which for a while seems rather Victorian.
But then the viewer realizes that for allegorists of the 19th century, the human form was a means of personifying concepts while for their counterparts today it is more often a vehicle for political and social comment.
Accordingly, "Traces," which was organized by the museum's senior curator, Marysol Nieves, covers all the fashionable issues, from sex and race to identity, individual and collective.
Yet like most contemporary political shows it has nothing to offer in the way of doctrine unless the curator's reverent attitude toward her photographers counts as such.

Ideas &amp; Trends; In the Bluegrass Nation: For the Twang of It
SITTING in the shade thrown by a cordon of motor homes, M. D. Culpepper, 71, doffed his blue baseball cap, which was hand-embroidered with the words Bluegrass Junkie.
"When my wife died on the first of January, people said I should go to meetings," said the retired Kentucky-born coal miner.
But instead of going to church, Mr.
Culpepper sought solace in bluegrass, a raw-boned form of country music in which the singers play fiddles, banjos and guitars, harmonizing over love, usually lost, and liquor, preferably moonshine.
The blend of hillbilly strings and bluesy laments began 50 years ago with Bill Monroe and Earl Scruggs.

NOBLES: Get Ready For Ethelred
August should be a good month for Anglophiles.
The midday sun will be hot enough to share with mad dogs and Englishmen.
And a new computer data base called RoyaList will be released.
It claims to list and cross-index all of the British monarchs and their blood relatives.
Odd bits of trivia are included in the brief biographies, along with vital statistics on dates of birth and death.
For instance, "Ethelred  [ the Unready's ]  mother, Elfthryth, beat him with candles so hard and so often that he had a lifelong phobia of them."


Clintons Interviewed Under Oath By Counsel
President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were interviewed under oath at the White House today by the independent counsel who is investigating the range of issues known collectively as Whitewater, Government officials said.
Mr. and Mrs.

White House officials said the President's interview lasted about three and a half hours and was followed by Mrs.
Clinton's interview, which lasted about two hours.


Teamwork Starts at Top on Giants
Giants fans should send the Cleveland Browns' owner, Art Modell, a thank-you note.
It was Modell who introduced Wellington Mara and Bob Tisch over lunch in New York four and a half years ago, and although there were doubts at the time, that meeting has led to one of the most successful unions in sports ownership.
And as the Giants begin training camp today, the future for Giants ownership -- one that now includes Mara's son John -- has never looked brighter.
"I must admit, I wasn't sure if the relationship would work," said Modell.
"When you have two successful men who are used to doing things their way, these kinds of unions are hard to pull off. But it has proven to be great for them and great for the Giants."


Molly Kremers, Jeffrey Williams
Molly Kathleen Kremers, the daughter of Eileen Montgomery Kremers of Sayville, L.I., and Dr.

The bride's father is a professor of English at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, L.I., where her stepmother, Paula Wagner Kremers, is an admissions counselor.


For Safety's Sake and Their Own, Towns Learn to Pamper Pedestrians
New Jersey municipalities used to be primarily concerned with moving traffic through town as quickly as possible.
Now that concern is shifting -- from cars and trucks to people on foot.
By state law, motorists must yield to pedestrians in crosswalks.
But unlike California, where drivers actually do yield -- and are universally berated if they don't -- New Jersey seldom enforces the law.


Politics as a Numbers Game: G.O.P.'s No. 1 Is Threatened

In the 1960's, Hallmark and all the leading card companies depended heavily upon freelance submissions of humorous card ideas (a practice since pretty well abandoned).
I was one of the 20 or so best-selling freelancers who actually made a comfortable living in this then-lucrative market.
Today, Hallmark may have its rural retreat and its experts, but it amuses me to glance through a rack of cards and still find some of my original gags after all these years.

'The Sorcerer' Will Replace 'The Pirates of Penzance' at Purchase College
JOHN WELLINGTON WELLS, Gilbert and Sullivan's dealer in magic and spells, not to mention blessings and curses and ever-fill'd purses, is en route to Purchase College for performances next Saturday and Sunday of "The Sorcerer," replacing the fully staged production of "Pirates of Penzance" that had been promised, then postponed, precisely for lack of a filled purse.
"The Sorcerer" is not nearly so popular an opera as "Pirates," but it will be given in semi-staged concert form, thus saving a good part of the $400,000 it cost to mount last year's "H.M.S. Pinafore." It also brings back three of the same British singers who sailed the ocean blue -- Ann Howard, Eric Roberts and Gordon Sandison -- and will again have Paul Lustig Dunkel conducting the Westchester Philharmonic.

Congressional Memo; After Bad Week, G.O.P. Looks to Budget for Help
The Republicans had a bad week on Capitol Hill.
A Democratic filibuster killed regulatory legislation in the Senate.
Republicans from both houses admitted they had given up on enacting a line-item veto this year.
It became clear that the Republicans could not agree on a broad strategy to oppose affirmative action policies, the senators remained split on welfare and even in the more conservative House Republicans gave up on killing public broadcasting and legal services for the poor.


Permit Revoked for Toys 'R' Us; Store Vows to Fight
In a triumph for the Upper East Side coalition fighting the opening of a Toys 'R' Us superstore, the City's zoning board voted 3 to 2 last week to revoke the project's construction permit.
That forced crews to halt months of work converting a warehouse at 80th Street and Third Avenue for the store.
But the dispute is far from over: Toys 'R' Us vowed to appeal in court.

Extra-Large Funds Don't Deserve Sneers
BIG funds generally get a bad rap from investment advisers.
Watch out for huge funds, the advisers say, because they will have trouble producing the blockbuster returns that lured all that money in the first place.
Ballooning funds are forced to buy bigger stocks with less potential, the argument goes, and managers cannot make big bets on personal favorites without violating certain rules on concentration.
"All things being equal, I'd choose the smaller fund," said Craig A. Litman, a principal in Litman/Gregory, an investment management firm in San Francisco that specializes in mutual funds.


TEETH: Look, Ma, All Cavities!
Since 1989, Nancy (Dr. Bukk) Albert has cast more than 8,000 sets of plastic Hollywood Style Fake Teeth in the kitchen of her Augusta, Ga., home.
Bukk teeth, as in buckteeth, have model names like Gnarly, Mongrel, Zipper and Incest.
The demented dentata have become popular props for a cult of Southern well-breds (top photo) who appear at dance clubs as clodhopping inbreds (bottom photo, the original Dr. Bukk model).
Maybe they're working out a sense of Southern inferiority.
Or maybe the teeth are just the dental version of a redneck joke.
Folks with bad teeth are among the few remaining acceptable targets of nasty humor.

Hey, Kids, Get to Know Your Pals in Blue!
IN the recess yard at Our Lady of Perpetual Help grade school, Maple Shade, N.J., we would have been flabbergasted, circa 1959, to hear that kids of the future would be trading cop cards instead of baseball cards.
Back then, the only cop we routinely encountered was a patrolman we nicknamed Bluto, a menacing mouth-breather who looked like a Wurlitzer jukebox that somebody had left a tiny blue cap on top of.
Our entire concept of the criminal justice system was summed up by the phrase "Yikes, here comes Bluto."


Wharton Grave
To the Editor:
I visited Edith Wharton's grave in the Cimetiere des Gonards at Versailles this spring carrying the clipping of Barbara Shoup's article "In Search of Edith Wharton" (Jan. 23, 1994).
Barbara Shoup had reported the grave in poor condition, "weathered, mottled with bird droppings and mold." A caretaker in blue work clothes peered at the photo in the clipping and said he recognized the grave, which had recently been cleaned.
He showed me the location on a cemetery map and pointed up a hill where I found the grave, in glowing white stone, with fresh gravel pebbles around the borders, two pots of Scotch heather at the head.
I told him the grave looked well cared for.
The caretaker told me a movie had recently been made of Wharton's life -- he was probably thinking of "The Age of Innocence" -- and that was why her tomb had been cleaned.
He was cordial and thanked me for visiting.

Among the performers are Renee Jolles, violinist; Lois Martin, violist; Harry Clark, cellist, and Sanda Schuldmann, pianist.

[ APPEARANCES ] ; High Brow
AS SOON AS I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO READ Nancy Drew, I grasped the concept that eyebrows signal emotion.
His brows knit in concentration. . . .
Her brows flew up in surprise.
But it has only been through a series of awakenings that I've come to realize the extent to which eyebrows also signal fashion awareness, grooming philosophy, orientation in time and where one stands in the continuum between herd allegiance and self-expression.
As a kid, I may even have gawked at a few women whose thin, penciled crescents made them seem like escapees from old black-and-white movies, never considering what went into achieving such a look or that young women of my generation might be altering their brows.
Then one day, junior year in high school, L. walked into physics with swollen red bumps over her eyes.
This excited a lot of talk. (L. was a very pretty girl.) It turned out that L.'s mother had caused the swelling by plucking L.'s eyebrows, pulling out the hairs one by one.
I had read that American Indians did this to their beards, one of many fascinating tortures they went through to become warriors.
But it seemed inconceivable that a mother and daughter in Briarcliff Manor would have engaged in such a painful rite.

THEATER: UP AND COMING -- Caroline Seymour; 'A Difficult Peg to Fit' Finds Her Place in New York
AS JEAN, THE ACCOMMODATING but deeply anguished woman at the center of Mike Leigh's ensemble drama, "Ecstasy," Caroline Seymour is the embodiment of the wan, economically enslaved British working class, circa 1979.
Living in a squalid, one-room flat in north London, working at a gas station, Jean drinks, smokes, has semi-consensual sex with a galoot she hardly knows and lies to herself and to her equally trapped friends that life is bearable.
It is well into the second act before she lets slip a fantasy.
"My character says, 'I want to go to America,' " Ms.
Seymour said in an interview on the set at the Judith Anderson Theater on West 42d Street, where the play has just reopened after a move.
"And every night I think, 'Bloody 'ell, I made it! This girl didn't.' "


LIVE AND LET DIE
Harriet Brickman's story of her father's death highlights two important things to do, under similar stressful circumstances, in this age of medical miracles (Hers: "Live and Let Die," July 2).
First, find a personal physician when you don't really need one, when you are sound in mind and body and can talk about "heroic" measures.
Secondly, identify a hospital in your area that is not a "teaching institution" or a university hospital associated with a medical school.
This might be a community hospital or one associated with a religious order.
This type of hospital will not be populated with medical students, interns, residents, fellows and faculty members.
Teaching hospitals are fine and necessary, but not the place to die quietly and with dignity.

Indelible Visions of a Faded World
AMERICAN INDIANS ONCE hunted the bluffs over the deep glacial lake called Otsego in central New York -- the lake James Fenimore Cooper called Glimmerglass -- and much of what they saw still exists today.
Deer are a hazard on the old road between Cooperstown and nearby Cherry Valley; coyote, lynxes and wolves reportedly roam the forests again.
The hill-and-valley terrain boasts sudden, romantic changes of weather, and the stars are brilliant at night.
Cooperstown, a pristine waterside cluster of Early American houses 70 miles west of Albany, is best known as the mecca of baseball (the sport's Hall of Fame is here) and as the site of the Glimmerglass Opera.
But it is also home to the New York State Historical Association, a century-old research archive whose rich holdings in 19th-century American documents and paintings are housed on the site of a farm owned by Cooper.


Vanya Redux


Agents Turning To Service Fees
HENRY and Olga Yaniz, who own A. A. Yaniz Tours in Hollywood, Fla., do not charge their clients "service fees." "That's a no-no," Mr.
Yaniz said.
"We charge a processing fee." By whatever name, it is $10 for an airline ticket, and the agency has charged it since February without apparent loss of clients, he said.
Such fees are being encountered increasingly since the airlines announced in February that they would cut back agents' commissions on domestic tickets beginning in April, by putting a $50 ceiling on the 10 percent usually paid.
It is still easy to use an agency that does not levy one.
But most agencies are being pinched, and by a year from now, according to Judith Zacek of Newtonville, Mass., a leading consultant in the industry, some will be out of business, still more will be charging fees and the rest may be less willing to search out the right little hotel to go with your frequent-flier ticket.

For Very Strange Bedfellows, Try Redistricting
Late in June, on the day after the United States Supreme Court invalidated Georgia Congressional districting that had created three districts with majorities of black voters, State Representative Billy McKinney, a black Democrat, received telephone calls from three white Republican legislators.
The Court's ruling meant that the Legislature would have to redraw Congressional districts, and the Republicans, whose party in Georgia is overwhelmingly white, wanted to know whether Mr.
McKinney would work with them to try to preserve as many black districts as possible.

We Can't Afford Luxury of Financing the Arts
To the Editor:
The logic in "Legislators Against the Arts" (editorial, July 19) seems convoluted.
On one hand you insist that because our constituencies are dependent on the arts, we should be held accountable for voting to phase out the National Endowment for the Arts, but on the other hand you rightly point out that the "arts in New York will not, of course, die without Federal support."

POSTINGS: 7,500-Square-Foot Addition Planned; City Bar Association To Grow In Place
When the Association of the Bar of the City of New York was trying to find room in its building for more staff members and meeting rooms, it did what lawyers are trained to do: read the fine print.
By careful study of the floor plans, the association has found a way to add 7,500 square feet to the 38,000-square-foot, century-old structure at 42 West 44th Street, across from the New York Yacht Club.
When renovations are completed next year, as part of the group's 125th anniversary, the building should house 150 staff members, many of whom work next door at No. 36.

July 16-22; Tax Fraud Trips Up 2 Old Sluggers
Two aging stars from baseball's seemingly more innocent days turned up in Brooklyn last week, but this was no return to the sunshine of Ebbets Field.
Duke Snider, who hit 407 home runs in 18 seasons and starred in center field for the Brooklyn Dodgers in their headiest days, and Willie McCovey, who hit 521 in 22 seasons, were there to plead guilty to tax fraud charges in Federal Court.
In both cases, the accusations involved failure to report tens of thousands of dollars in income from memorabilia shows and promotional appearances over the course of several years; a 1989 sports memorabilia show in Atlantic City figured in both sets of charges.

Earlier in the year, the Yale lab had been the site of a near-fatal spill of Sabia virus, for which a visiting researcher was disciplined.

Some Familiar Faces, From Foreign Places
IN spite of the dry soil and soaring temperatures, some plants are getting along just fine this summer.
They are called weeds.
These particular plants are quite clever.
They huddle near ornamentals as if to disguise themselves, or worse, they grow so close in and under favored plants that they are sometimes not seen.

Objection!
To the Editor:
As the co-author with Michael Oppenheimer of "Dead Heat" (1990), I object to Gregg Easterbrook's letter of June 25, in which he falsely characterizes our book, which is about the threats posed by global warming, as advancing "dubious claims" and "spurious argument."


On Electronic Highway, Manhattan Is A Destination
YOU can't call it the software industry anymore, because its products go well beyond computer programs.
Multimedia is too all-encompassing, while information technology seems to exclude entertainment products.
Interactive technology probably comes closest, at least until some newly-coined expression -- infoware is a recent one -- takes hold.
But whatever this amorphous industry is called, the people who form its creative backbone -- the ones who dream up the steady stream of products flitting across the internet, powering business computers, starring in interactive television entertainment and fueling the insatiable lust for video games -- are flocking to this city.


Making Room for the Rubenesque
ON a Saturday night at Nell's on 14th Street, fashionably dressed, slim women sip drinks coyly at the bar.
Their eyes dart about, they run their hands self-consciously through their hair.
Men lean against the bar, predacious, chatting nominally with their pals.
The hunters and the hunted exchange glances, sometimes stares.
The scene is quintessential New York City nightlife.
But 30 blocks uptown, the scene has taken a twist of generous proportions.


Bud Feuchtwanger, Irene Kaminsky
Dr.
Irene Kaminsky, a psychologist in New York, was married on Friday to Joseph Bud Feuchtwanger 3d, a management consultant, also in New York.
Rabbi Myron Kinberg performed the ceremony on Cooper's Beach in Southampton, L.I.

Anatole Kaminsky.
The bride's father was a physician in general practice in New York.

If Your Thinking of Living In/Marble Hill; A Bit of Manhattan in the Bronx
YES, you have crossed the Harlem River and, yes, that is the northern tip of Manhattan island that you can see to the south.
But as residents of Marble Hill are quick to point out, you are not in the Bronx: because of a 19th-century public works project that reshaped Manhattan island and severed its topmost land, Marble Hill is across the river and into what logically should be the Bronx.
It is a quirky and little-known neighborhood whose residents consider it a well-kept secret.
Where else in Manhattan can you find a six-bedroom, three-story house on a quiet, tree-lined street with an attic, a basement, an enclosed front porch and a pretty facade for sale for $174,000?
Or a three-family house with six bedrooms on an architecturally magnificent street with an asking price of $295,000?


Correction
An article on June 4 about archeological digs for tourists in Israel included a telephone number erroneously.
A letter dated July 5 points out that United Tours no longer sets up the digs.
As the article said, arrangements can made through Archeological Seminars in Jerusalem, (972-2) 273515.


New Zealander Brings the Old Course to Its Knees
A freshening wind, the sort the Scots would call a "proper wind," blew hard out of the north across the Old Course today, and a fresh face rode it right into the lead of the British Open.
Michael Campbell, a 26-year-old native of New Zealand who is playing in just his second Open, shot a stunning round of 65 -- lowest of the championship and by three strokes the lowest round of the cold, blustery day -- and charged to the top of a leader board dominated by a golf version of the United Nations.
Nine countries are represented in the first 15 spots.


Nasdaq Index Flirts With 1,000, Perhaps Ahead of Its Time
Though it was hammered for much of last week, the Nasdaq composite stock index reached a milestone early on: It reached 1,000 points for the first time.
True, the event on Monday did not lead to excessive jubilation.
A stock-market rout followed on Tuesday and Wednesday as technology companies, pervasive in the index, turned in earnings that disappointed.


Building a Bridge
The nine-mile bridge that will connect Prince Edward Island to the Canadian mainland starting in May 1997 doesn't have a name yet, but it has its own tour.
The 35-minute excursion explains the technology required to build the link (which will consist of 44 concrete spans on pilings), the environmental safeguards being incorporated into it and the economic impact of the project.


We Can't Afford Luxury of Financing the Arts; Upstate Benefits Too
To the Editor:
"Legislators Against the Arts" (editorial, July 19) accuses me of "joining the anti-arts swing" in Congress.
You then go on to forgive me, saying, in effect, that the arts do not matter that much in upstate New York.
You are wrong on both counts.


Take It From a Composer: This Is How the Music Goes
VIRGIL THOMSON, WHO perfected the art of the sweeping generalization, used to say that conductors who were composers brought something to their music-making that conductors who were just performers, however brilliant, did not.
Composer-conductors might not be as technically proficient or as able to elicit sumptuous orchestral sound as their noncomposing counterparts, but they could show you how a piece of music was supposed to go.
Like many of Thomson's sweeping generalizations, this one, which is brought to mind by some new reissues of Benjamin Britten performances on Decca/London, stands up surprisingly well to analysis.
Think of Eugene Ormandy, a masterly orchestra builder.
Under Ormandy, the Philadelphia Orchestra was renowned for its technical excellence and rich sound. ("One would like to stroke its tone," Thomson once wrote of the string section.) But one did not turn to Ormandy for probing performances.
His work was always beautiful, always musical, seldom revelatory.


CHATTER: Censor the Internet; Against Censorship
What, if anything, should be done to limit sexually explicit material on the Internet?
Young or old, you have to look for sex on the Internet.
People who want to censor the Internet want to censor any discussion or description of sexual life.
That's wrong.

T-Shirts Don't Count
Anyone looking for a tacky T-shirt on his next trip to Washington will have to shop some place other than the Mall.
The long strip of parkland between the Capitol and the Washington Monument was cleared of most T-shirt vendors on July 2 when a Federal judge ruled that the only items that may be sold there are printed materials -- books, pamphlets, bumper stickers and the like -- pertaining to a political cause.


Foreign Afffairs; Enter Le Bulldozer
Now this could get interesting.
Jacques Chirac has only been President of France for two months, but in that brief span he has demonstrated that he is going to pose a very different challenge for Washington than his predecessors.
Mr.
Chirac has signaled that he won't be content playing the traditional French role of annoying the U.S., by ostentatiously asserting French independence but ultimately falling in line behind American leadership.
No, no, Mr.
Chirac is hunting bigger game.
He aspires to supplant Washington as leader of the Western alliance, period, full stop, hand over the keys.


The Troubled House of Starting Pitching Includes a Revolving Door
Not even their mothers would think their names are of the household variety.
Some of them materialize so quickly -- and stay so briefly -- that even a scorecard wouldn't help.
Many of them started games in the space of a few days last week: Dilson Torres and Melvin Bunch of Kansas City, Jose Lima of Detroit, Jeff Suppan of Boston, Mike Sirotka of the Chicago White Sox, Rafael Carmona of Seattle, Edwin Hurtado of Toronto, Brian Boehringer of the Yankees, Bryan Rekar of Colorado, Ugueth Urbina of Montreal, Steve Parris and John Ericks of Pittsburgh, Glenn Dishman of San Diego, Bill Pulsipher and Jason Isringhausen of the Mets.

July 16-22; The Greeks Knew About Fortune
These days, Democrats in Congress like to take the long view.
Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who has been majority leader, minority leader, majority leader again, president pro tempore, chairman of the Appropriations Committee and now is the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, does it best.


Bluegrass, Rock and Jazz, Live, on the Pier
IF you live around the South Street Seaport, you probably can tell when six o'clock rolls around.
How, you ask?
Is it the crush of harried commuters headed home?
The aroma of the crews cleaning up the Fulton Fish Market?
Or when the angle of the sun is just so?
Nope. It's when the music starts.


CHATTER: Censor the Internet; Don't Seek, Don't Find
What, if anything, should be done to limit sexually explicit material on the Internet?
I haven't seen a bit of porn, because I haven't looked for any.
At my local drugstore, I can't locate a copy of Time magazine without scanning the displays of lewd ones.
At least on the Internet, we have a choice.

Passions Loosed In Queens For Soccer
Ivo Perelman left his studio apartment on the Lower East Side, stepped onto an uptown F train and headed toward the giant television screens of Queens.
A jazz musician and immigrant from Brazil, he wanted to be as close to Latin America as he could get during the America Cup soccer tournament that ends today.
His destination: Jackson Heights.
In a neighborhood that has become a crossroads of a diverse range of Latin American social clubs and discotecas -- where Uruguayan bars abut Ecuadoran, Argentine and Chilean restaurants -- Mr.
Perelman settled into a Colombian restaurant called Chibcha on Roosevelt Avenue.
As he watched the United States-Brazil game on Thursday night, he seemed to inhale the fervor of the other patrons, fellow Latin American immigrants.


The World; Iron Fist Meets Rubber Face
RUSSIANS have always loved a political joke, mostly because the punchline has always been illicit.
Before 1917, people could be put in jail for publicly mocking the Czar.
In Communist times, the slightest crack about party leaders landed people in Siberia. (Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, not usually known for his sense of humor, was sent to the Gulag for irreverently describing Stalin as "the mustached one," in a letter to a friend.)
Under Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, the rules slackened a bit, and high-minded satire began slipping onto radio and television, but never anything as low-down and biting as the average Reagan skit on "Saturday Night Live."


Jackson Hole
Forty years ago, residents thought gambling was a big tourist draw in this western Wyoming resort town.
Games of chance were illegal, but leaders in Jackson persuaded state government and law enforcement to look the other way.
In 1955, however, Gov.
Milward L. Simpson couldn't ignore it any longer, despite local pleas that cracking down would ruin tourism.
Pressured by out-of-state publicity, the governor seized the slot machines and gaming tables at the Wort Hotel.
Jackson's merchants, as it turned out, had little to worry about -- there were plenty of other attractions.
An estimated 1.8 million tourists are expected here this summer to live the cowboy life at a dude ranch, hike nature trails, climb the Tetons or run the Snake River.
The arts have also flourished amid the natural splendor, with the 34th annual Grand Teton Music Festival continuing through Aug. 26 and Western art on permanent display in the National Wildlife Art Museum.


The Week That Was Bad, and Real Bad
Oh, so that is what a really bad day in the stock market feels like.
Until lunchtime last Wednesday, bad days had become so infrequent that professional traders seemed momentarily addled when technology stocks led a lemming-like plunge in midday prices across all the major stock markets.


Devils Raise Prices
The Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils may have decided against going south, but their ticket prices have gone north.


FUNDS WATCH
True Candor From Fund Proves Timely
T.
Rowe Price sent a cautionary letter about unrealistic performance expectations to some technology fund shareholders just weeks after John C. Bogle, chairman of the Vanguard Group, wrote a similar one to investors in the Vanguard Index funds.


Fort Totten Proposal: Give It to the Gateway
With a little more than a month to go before the future of Fort Totten is decided, a proposal to convert the historic base into a park is gaining support among community leaders.
Sean Walsh, chairman of the United Civic Council of Queens, a group of civic presidents, has offered a proposal to local community boards and the Queens borough president's office which would merge the base into Gateway National Park.
"This is a practical idea because it's cheaper to run than the military base and what's already out here could stay," he said.

POSTINGS: Photographs by Karl Strauss at Equitable Gallery; A New York City That Has Vanished
Illuminated hands of a clock point to 5:40 on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Tower at East 24th Street.
A light caps the tower.
Street lamps glow below.
It is a moment in 1909, the year the tower by Cass Gilbert was completed, captured in a platinum print by the New York-born photographer and cinematographer Karl Struss (1886-1981).
The vintage print, "Metropolitan Tower at Twilight," is one of more than 100 in "New York to Hollywood: The Photography of Karl Struss," an exhibit opening Friday at the Equitable Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue at 51st Street.
"Among the most intriguing images are views of the city that no longer exist," said Pari Stave, the gallery director.
"He captured the now-vanished Penn Station and a moment in history when the horse-drawn carriage was being replaced by the elevated train."

CHATTER: Censor the Internet; Don't Mind the Neighbors
What, if anything, should be done to limit sexually explicit material on the Internet?
America, try raising your kids instead of the moral fiber of your neighbors.

The guy next door doesn't care what you think.
I know.

Stalking a Man of Words With Music
THE LEAST LIKELY OF recent American operas, "Modern Painters," will be given its premiere at the Santa Fe Opera on Saturday.
It has for its central character John Ruskin (1819-1900), esthetic dictator, architectural preservationist, social reformer and incomparable poet in prose.
With his "Stones of Venice," his "Seven Lamps of Architecture" and, above all, the 2,000 and more pages of his "Modern Painters" (1843-60), Ruskin gave a new dimension to writing on art for a broad public. (He also campaigned for the old-age pension and for universal state education in Britain.)

Puerto Rico Reeling Under Scourge Of Drugs and Rising Gang Violence
It used to be that robberies and the occasional assault were the worst crimes in this coastal town of 40,000 people west of San Juan.
That was before "the massacre of Caserio Zorrilla" or the discovery of the bullet-riddled body of a 12-year-old boy by a nearby river.
"Overnight, a monster awakened," said Sgt.
Eugenio Montes of the police, who specializes in homicide investigations.


New Leader Of Mormons Takes Joy In Changes
Among the big-screen movies showing here, "Legacy," an official production of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is one of the hottest tickets in town.
Shown 10 times daily on a 62-foot-wide screen, with symphonic Dolby sound, it tells a fictional love story set against the backdrop of the Mormon trek to Utah, a covered-wagon journey beset by winter weather, sickness and vigilante attack.
In the church's estimate, two million people have seen the hourlong film since July 1993.

THEY FEEL FOR YOU
Gerri Hirshey's article on greeting cards left me, appropriately, without words ("Happy  [ ]  Day to You," July 2).
But I found no explanation for a curiosity I have noticed: Mother's Day cards seem to be almost the size of doormats while those for Father's Day have the dimensions of a postage stamp.

Clinton Regains His Voice With 3 Speeches
Inside the White House they call them "the trilogy" -- the series of highly personal speeches President Clinton has delivered this summer in an effort to re-establish his voice and the power of the President to lead as much through oratory as through legislative agility.
In doing so, Mr.
Clinton has harkened back to 1991, when as governor of Arkansas he went three times to his alma mater of Georgetown University to deliver a series of speeches setting out his vision of a "new covenant" between the government and the American people.


Why the Stocks Aren't Splitting
THE stock market may have sputtered a bit this week, but behind its overall ascent in 1995 lies a mystery: Why haven't companies been splitting their stock left and right?
Through July 14 there have been only 57 splits of three shares for two, or greater, on the New York Stock Exchange, according to Standard &amp; Poor's.
That pace is about equal to the 110 such splits in all of 1994, even though the S.&amp; P. 500 fell 1.5 percent last year and is up 18.6 percent in midyear 1995.
The 1995 pace also looks slow compared with the rate in other bullish periods, like 1993, when there were 142 splits, and 1983, when there were 225.


A Co-op Buyer's Checklist
WHEN Saul Katz bought his house on Staten Island he wanted to insure that his dream home wouldn't turn into a nightmare after the closing.
So he hired a pest inspector to check for termites, a construction expert to check for structural problems, a surveyor to check the property lines and a lawyer to check up on everything else.


The Nation; On Capitol Hill, Politics Both High and Low
SOME of the proudest moments in modern American politics have occurred during Congressional investigations.
Take, for instance, the scene from the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954, so often replayed on television, when Joseph Welch, the counsel for the Army, unraveled Senator Joseph R. McCarthy with the lament: "Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?" Or consider the solemn votes in the House Judiciary Committee 21 summers ago to impeach President Richard M. Nixon.


Lung Power
To the Editor:
While my wife and I agree with all of Margo Jefferson's points about the inferiority of the Broadway musical "Sunset Boulevard" to its cinematic source  [ "Two Ways to Travel From Screen to Stage," July 9 ] , the theatrical version made us think about an issue that Billy Wilder's movie never addressed: Why couldn't Norma Desmond get a job in talkies?


PHOTOGRAPHER'S JOURNAL


A Worry in Queens: Newark Airport's Monorail Might Work
Workers have not quite finished laying the tracks for a monorail system that is to snake from terminal to terminal at Newark International Airport, but the project has already turned into an odd pilgrimage site.
The visitors, though, are not coming joyfully.
They are officials from Queens, and they are trooping out here to see the monorail because they fear that it is a threat to two of their borough's most valuable assets, Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports.
When the system is done by 1999, passengers should be able to use mass transit to travel between Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan and Newark Airport in just 20 minutes.


Old Studio 54 Recycled Again: Virtual Reality
The playground of the future is coming to New York City, and it will be in one of the city's glitziest playgrounds of the past -- the former Studio 54.
"We're bringing the grand lady back," said Rex Shaw, who has teamed up with Herbert Marion to turn the 30,000 square-foot-space at 254 West 54th Street into a multilevel virtual reality center.
The partners, known as the 145A Corporation, squared away the lease a couple of weeks ago, and expect to spend $6 million on the space, once home to the peerless 70's nightclub of Ian Schrager and the late Steve Rubell.


Jennifer Lister, Anthony Oldfield
Jennifer Ann Lister, a daughter of Dr.
Julius Lister of Weston, Mass., and the late Jean Jenkins Lister, was married yesterday to Anthony John Oldfield, a son of Peter and Anita Oldfield of Lewes, England.
The Rev.
Charles Parthum performed the ceremony at St.
Peter's Episcopal Church in Weston, Mass.
Mrs.
Oldfield, 27, is the executive vice president of Agora Cosmetics, a cosmetics manufacturer in New York.
She graduated from Wellesley College.
Her father is the chief of pediatric surgery at the Metrowest Medical Center in Framingham, Mass., and is a visiting surgeon at Children's Hospital in Boston.


Buses With Lifts
To the Editor
I read with interest "Making Way for Wheelchairs" (Practical Traveler, June 11).
Adirondack Trailways, like Greyhound of Canada, has recently added two wheelchair-accessible coaches to our fleet of 100, with a third scheduled for July.
Our service, and that of our affiliates Pine Hill and New York Trailways, extends from New York City to Albany, Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester, Lake Placid, Lake George, Saratoga, Cooperstown and many smaller communities throughout the state.
We also operate daily service to Toronto from New York City and to Long Island points from Upstate New York.


Passengers Flee Fire On a Subway Train
A motor in the undercarriage of a northbound D train burst into flames yesterday in a Harlem station, filling the platform with thick, black smoke and sending passengers and subway employees scrambling for exits, the police said.
Two police officers, a token booth clerk and five passengers on the train suffered minor smoke inhalation, and four of the injured were taken to St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, the Emergency Medical Service said.

MOVIES THIS WEEK
Love blossoms in different soils in a good batch of films on television this week.
John Ford's dusty STAGECOACH (1939) is a marvelously detailed frontier mural.
Ford's camera misses nothing.
Though the director allots due footage to each passenger, jouncing across Indian terrain, he clearly favors John Wayne as a unworldly cowboy and Claire Trevor as a prostitute.
Their gradually growing love is touching and entirely credible, and is carried into a musical coda.
The picture is so engrossing you may feel like an eavesdropper.
This began the director's cavalcade of great westerns -- Saturday at 10:30 A.M., 3:20 P.M. and 3:35 A.M. on Bravo.


Visionary's Creations Flow From Center in Water Mill
ROBERT WILSON'S stage is all the world.
"There's more government money for the arts in Europe," one of Mr.
Wilson's collaborators, Maita di Niscemi, said, knowing that it is politically expedient to reiterate the obvious.
"And that's why he's more famous in Europe than in America."


Honored by Firemen
Thomas Saccomanno, 9, of Somers, who has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, received a fireman's hat and a plaque when doors were dedicated to him at Engine Company 237 on Morgan Avenue in Brooklyn.
The doors were painted by the graffiti artist Jean 13 in blue, white, gray and black, the favorite colors of Thomas, seated behind his mother, Donna Saccomanno, a trustee of the New York chapter of the Parent Project for Muscular Dystrophy Research.
The event raised $5,000 for the project. (Andrew Lichenstein for The New York Times)


Inquiry Clears Jail of Cover-Up
ALLEGATIONS that official documents at the County Correctional Complex here were altered following two days of unrest last year are unfounded, according to findings released this month by a commission appointed to investigate security and safety issues at the jail.
The 67-page report is the result of months of hearings by the Marbach Commission, appointed by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke in December.
The commission -- headed by retired Justice John C. Marbach of State Supreme Court -- began its investigation after reports in Gannett Suburban Newspapers alleged that incidents at the jail on Nov. 29 and 30 were more serious than Department of Corrections officials had portrayed.


The Trouble at Washington Irving High
BLEDY CAPELLAN was 13 when he got lost between the Fort Greene projects and wherever the test for Stuyvesant, Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech was being held.
Thus he ended up in the struggle for the soul of Washington Irving, the high school on my street.
"Sounds like fate to me," I said.


Facing Homophobia, or Maybe Just Bureaucracy
This languid hamlet overlooking the Hudson River has been rattled by what some residents consider a routine dispute over a nightclub's sprinkler system but others view as a battle for tolerance of homosexuals in conservative rural areas.
The center of the fight is a faded roadhouse along scenic 9W just below Kingston, N.Y., that calls itself the Club.
In an April newspaper advertisement, it promised that it would be the state's largest gay nightclub outside New York City, but it has yet to open.
Two state judges have ordered local officials to let the Club open, but they have balked.
The Club's windows remain boarded, and its new operators are spending their time dealing with vandalism like graffiti warning of AIDS.


Robin Lipsett, Bradley Berggren
Robin Lynn Lipsett, a daughter of Susan and Shelly M. Lipsett of Westport, Conn., was married last evening to Bradley Scott Berggren, the son of Lorraine and J. Philip Berggren of Essex, Conn.
Rabbi Judith Lewis performed the ceremony at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Old Greenwich, Conn.
Mrs.
Berggren, 28, graduated from the University of Vermont, as did the bridegroom.
The bride received a master's degree in education from Hunter College and teaches the first grade at the Calhoun School in New York.


Jennifer Rhodes, Matthew Kropf
Jennifer Eve Rhodes, a daughter of Drs.
Karen and Robert Rhodes of Wesley Hills, N.Y., was married yesterday in Central Valley, N.Y., to Matthew G. Kropf, the son of Robin Kropf of Alpine Meadows, Calif., and Col.
Arnold Kropf of McLean, Va.
The Rev.
Sidney Kay Wilde, a Unitarian minister, performed the ceremony at the Inn at Central Valley.
The bride and the bridegroom, both 24, graduated from Duke University, where Mr.
Kropf is a candidate for a Ph.D. in economics.
Mrs.
Rhodes-Kropf is a third-year medical student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.


David Scott and Cyndi Wolfman
CYNDI WOLFMAN, the senior producer on "The Gordon Elliot Show," and David Scott, a producer for "Donahue," met six years ago while working on "Geraldo." They have produced talk shows on satanic cults as well as on people without legs, fathers, lovers or the ability to diet.
In a typical workweek, Mr.
Scott, 32, might put together a show, say, about a husband who plotted to kill his wife, while Ms.
Wolfman might oversee one about a bridegroom who jumped out a church window just as his bride was walking down the aisle.


We Can't Afford Luxury of Financing the Arts; A True Advocate
To the Editor:
"Legislators Against the Arts" (editorial, July 19) is right in stating the importance of the National Endowment for the Arts to citizens of New York as well as the rest of the nation.
But you misstate the role of Representative Amo Houghton when you suggest his vote on final passage of the Interior Appropriations bill indicates opposition to continued Federal support for the arts agency.


Miss Dopsovic, Captain Darcy
Elizabeth Ann Dopsovic, a daughter of Richard and Patricia Dopsovic of Brightwaters, L.I., was married yesterday to Capt.
Christopher Joseph Darcy, a son of Joseph and Elizabeth Darcy, also of Brightwaters.
The Rev.
Bernard Blood performed the ceremony at St.
Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in Bay Shore, L.I.
Mrs.
Darcy, 26, is a legislative assistant in the Washington office of United States Representative Rick A. Lazio, Republican of New York.
The bride graduated from Villanova University.

Her father is the president of the Republic New York Corporation, the bank holding company in New York.


Bands On Tour: Integrity Bound?
FOR TWO DECADES, THE BIG rock tour has been a routine task.
Lately, however, some performers have been trying to find integrity on the tour circuit -- a tough place to make a stand against commercialism.
From Pearl Jam's on-again, off-again summer tour to the annual Lollapalooza Festival, which comes to Randalls Island on Friday, rockers have been trying to make good and do good at the same time.
"If you hate something," Eddie Vedder sings in Pearl Jam's "Not for You," "don't you do it too."
Performers who reach the level of arena headliner can rely on a professional rock infrastructure, from sound and light crews to truckers, T-shirt sellers and security guards.
Since the 1970's, all the musicians have had to do is perform, visit local radio stations and hire someone trustworthy to count the money.


Chaposa Springs Takes Test
They may not be Serena's Song, but they are prize 3-year-old fillies who can run, and nine of them ran the 70th Test Stakes at Saratoga today with Chaposa Springs outsprinting Miss Golden Circle to the wire by 2 1/2 lengths.
The Test Stakes brought together some of the best sprinting fillies in the country as well as some preparing for the Alabama Stakes at a mile and a quarter on Aug. 12, a race that usually looms as a milestone on the road to the championship of the class.
Serena's Song is occupied racing colts these days and may also skip the Alabama because of the distance.
But they are all headed for the Breeders' Cup on Oct. 28 and, somewhere down the line, the horses who ran best today will meet the queen of the class.


Car Mileage Charges: A Feeler That Fizzled
Car rental companies have mostly given up trying to charge renters extra for driving more than 100 miles a day, writing off the attempt as a pricing experiment that did not work out.
Facing rising costs and tough competition, the companies have been looking hard for ways to increase rates, and in April and May Alamo began charging drivers if they put more than 100 miles a day on its cars.
In an example of the copycat school of pricing, others followed.
In June, Budget said that it would begin charging 20 cents a mile on larger models.
Renters were driving its vehicles farther and farther, Budget said, and the auto manufacturers were, in turn, paying Budget less when the rental company sold its inventory back to them.
Avis and Hertz went along in some markets, charging an extra 25 cents for each mile above 100.


Todd Hundley Is Injured As Mets Fall to Rockies
Mets catcher Todd Hundley will be out of action indefinitely after spraining his left thumb and wrist during a home-plate collision with Eric Young in the third inning of New York's 5-4 loss to the Colorado Rockies tonight.
X-rays revealed no broken bones, but Hundley will have a magnetic resonance imaging test Sunday in New York to determine whether there is ligament and tendon damage.
Hundley injured the wrist while making the tag on a hard-charging Young, who was thrown out by second baseman Jeff Kent.


U.N. Chief Focuses on Africa's 'Underdog Conflicts'
Ending a punishing trip across Central Africa, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the United Nations Secretary General, was characteristically at peace with himself.
For a week, as the United Nations mission in faraway Bosnia was rapidly unraveling, he had been lecturing, analyzing and cajoling his way through three of what he calls his "underdog conflicts," in Rwanda, Angola and Burundi.
He was not repentant, or even defensive, about his priorities.
As his small chartered plane nosed north from Bujumbura to Addis Ababa, he asked a reporter what could he have done in New York or Europe during this time that would have been of equivalent value?Would waiting on the sidelines while the Americans, British and French grappled for a policy have been better than fulfilling a promise to African nations torn by even deadlier civil wars?


Getting the Players Ready for Prime Time
Consider what will happen a minute or two after 8 o'clock on Tuesday evening: The conductor Gerard Schwarz will enter from stage left, the way he always does.
The audience will applaud, the way it always does.
And the Mostly Moszart Orchestra will start playing, the way it always does.
Just another concert, right?
Wrong.
This one will be telecast on "Live from Lincoln Center." (Tuesday at 8 P.M. on Channel 13).
And though the 3,000 ticketholders in Avery Fisher Hall may not notice, it will be different.


Old Favorites In the West Village
AU TROQUET * (212) 924-3413; 328 West 12th Street, corner of Greenwich Street; $$; all major credit cards
This romantic little West Village bistro is a cozy, low-key spot with white-framed windows and lacy curtains, subdued lighting and a charming young French staff.
Its appealing, moderately priced menu includes starters of lean salmon marinated in basil and black pepper; salad of endive with Roquefort; escargots in a cream sauce with garlic and basil, and country pate.
Among the main courses are baby chicken in natural juices with onions and mushrooms; a tasty fricassee of shrimp Provencal (sadly, slightly overcooked on a recent visit); tournedos au poivre; grilled salmon with basil-cream sauce, and a savory roast rack of lamb. (Review: 12/9/ 88; revisited: 7/11/95)


Kristen Shaughnessy, Joseph Bush
Kristen Jean Shaughnessy, the daughter of John and Alice Shaughnessy of Pine Bush, N.Y., was married yesterday to Joseph Patrick Bush, a son of Marilee Bush of Cranford, N.J.
The Rev.
Norris Lee Cook performed the ceremony at the Hopewell Presbyterian Church in Thompson Ridge, N.Y.
The couple are both 27 and graduated from Hofstra University.
She is a reporter and weekend anchor on NY1 News, a cable news channel in New York.
Her father teaches physical education at the Crispell Middle School in Pine Bush.
Her mother teaches kindergarten at Circleville (N.Y.) Elementary School.


Showalter, Once Master of Control, Is Losing It
Buck Showalter has lost control of the Yankees.
Not full control and maybe not even enough control to totally spoil whatever run this flawed team might orchestrate in the next 10 weeks, but he has lost some control and that is a monumental occurrence because the Yankee manager thrives on complete control.
The media guides behind his desk are filed in alphabetical order, his pens are in one holder while his markers are stored in another and his shined cleats are neatly aligned beside his closet.
There is order to everything he does.
Order equals control.
Control fosters adequate preparation.
Preparation breeds the finest chance for success.
This creed is inscribed on Showalter's toothbrush.


Janet Vasquez, Maurice Campbell
Janet Mercedez Vasquez, the daughter of Josefa and Armando Vasquez of Manhattan, was married yesterday to Maurice Anthony Campbell, a son of Daphnie Grant of St.
Albans, Queens.
The Rev.
Calvin Pressley, a United Methodist minister, performed the nondenominational ceremony at Terrace on the Park, a catering establishment in Flushing, Queens.
Ms.
Vasquez, who is 26 and is keeping her name, is a social worker at the Central Brooklyn Coordinating Council, a social service agency.
She graduated magna cum laude from Hunter College and received a master's degree in social work from Fordham University.


Women of Substance
To the Editor:
In his otherwise graceful review of Frederick R. Karl's biography "George Eliot, Voice of a Century" (June 25), John Bayley makes a great deal of Eliot's harsh fictional treatment of conventional women in characters like Hetty Sorrel and Rosamond Vincy.
One line of the review in particular makes me want to rush to Eliot's defense: patronizingly citing Eliot as "naive," Mr.
Bayley claims she "possibly did not grasp how apparent to her readers must have been her dislike of physical beauty in her own sex." The unpleasant implication is, of course, that Eliot, not known for her physical charms, was actually jealous of her own characters (!) and "persecuted" them (Mr. Bayley's own word) to exact revenge.

She looks like a futuristic Valkyrie, a Power Ranger bolstered by implants and steroids.
Community Board 5 voted her in with a vote of 35 to 3, and 1 abstention (esthetics had nothing to do with it) on May 11.
Gretchen Dykstra, head of the Times Square Business Improvement District, can't wait until she's gone in December.
"Whatever it is, I'm glad it's short-lived," said Ms.
Dykstra.
"I don't personally like it. The image is hard-edged, unfriendly. As a woman I find it offensive."


Real Estate Values
When you've moved three times in four years, you discover the nearly impenetrable codes embedded in New York real estate ads and, more surprising, in your own heart.
This lesson in self-discovery can be disconcerting.
I consider myself progressive in outlook, admiring of technology, suspicious of sentimental backward glances and heavy drapes, and yet I now know that I must have a prewar apartment.
It's not "Old World elegance" (translation: the rooms are all brown) that I'm after.
Rather, it's the complexity of the floor plan and the integrity of the detailing.
Views and pure space, I've learned, do not impress.
Panoramic vistas belong to window seats in jumbo jets.
As for space, too much of it makes me feel -- even worse, makes anyone with me look -- puny.
I would much rather wend my way from room to room as if following an interesting conversation.
To me, a loft is the visual equivalent of a place mat.


Following Southampton's Lead: Fighting an Incinerator
After the town of Southampton, L.I., turned down an energy company's plan to build an incinerator near the Pine Barrens, the company set its sights on East New York.
Now residents and city officials are trying to force the company to look elsewhere again.
"I don't like it," said James Saunders, who lives a few blocks from 895 Essex Street, where the Atlas Bio-Energy Corporation wants to build a wood-burning incinerator to generate electricity.


Vintage Costumes On View in Paris
The rotunda of the Opera Garnier in Paris is inhabited at the moment (and until Dec. 31) by a graceful assembly of black foam mannequins wearing the dazzling costumes of three centuries of opera and ballet.
Accompanied by opera music, the mannequins climb the stairs or lounge on the balustrades in a mise en scene conceived by Alain Germain, a dance theater director.
There are about 200 costumes on display, including a collection of tutus.
The oldest outfit was worn at the court of Louis XIV.
Others, more modern, were designed by Yves Saint Laurent, Picasso and Cocteau.


A Classic Tale Springs From the Cupboard
Clueless  Alicia Silverstone, Stacey Dash, Wallace Shawn, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd Directed by Amy Heckerling PG-13 97 minutes
A different group of teen-agers -- with names like Tai, Cher, Dionne and Amber -- spend their time in Beverly Hills shopping for clothes, becoming Betties (desirable women) and dating Baldwins (hunks).
Cher (Ms. Silverstone) performs good deeds: transforming a clueless transfer student and trying to match up her debate teacher (Mr. Shawn) with a female faculty member.


A Bed for When a King Comes Calling
THE LAVISHLY CURTAINED FOUR-POSTER bed, installed in the new English galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is just about as far from a futon as sleeping gear gets.
And yet this bed was as functional when it was made 300 years ago as the roll-up mattress is today.
What has changed since the 17th century are the concerns of sleepers: minimal now, they were extravagant then.
The bed was just coming into its own as a status symbol when William of Orange became King William III in 1689.
By restoring formality to the court, he inspired the grand beds that soon began appearing in the homes of British aristocrats.


When Parents Offer Extras To Schools
At P.S. 6 on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, parents raised money this year with a concert featuring an alumnus, Peter Yarrow of the group Peter, Paul and Mary.
They also closed off the section of East 81st Street in front of the school for an Oktoberfest and waged a telethon, soliciting donations from parents and alumni.
The total take: about $200,000.
At P.S. 124, in a section of Park Slope, Brooklyn, with a high immigrant population, the P.T.A. sold candy.
It sponsored the school photographs.
And one parent sought help from two major foundations, unsuccessfully.
The P.T.A.'s total earnings: between $3,000 and $4,000.
As a result, P.S. 6 has more computers, more class trips and more new books in the library.

The News From Britain, Sort Of
THE ANCHORMAN AT THE DESK IS EX- tremely annoyed because his co-anchor, a younger woman he refers to around the newsroom as "viewer-friendly but intellectually challenged," has been chosen to cover a big story on the road.
He has seniority!
He should get all the juicy stories!
It's only a sitcom plot, though as you watch it you might imagine Dan Rather and Connie Chung speed-dialing their libel lawyers.
They wouldn't have a case, because the show, an installment of the English newsroom satire "Drop the Dead Donkey," was made last year, long before the Dan-Connie falling out.
The series, which has been a hit in Britain for five years, recently arrived here.
It is being shown on Comedy Central, on Mondays at 8:30 P.M. (and repeated Sundays at 11:30 P.M.), a hit-making slot following the channel's most famous British import, "Absolutely Fabulous."


Baby Pigeons Sighted! Urban Mystery Solved!
Whenever a worthy subject receives a better or more complete presentation than has hitherto been accorded it, our civilized life is advanced a little. -- Opening line of "The Pigeon," a 667-page encyclopedia.
I didn't used to be the sort of person who goes around quoting from "The Pigeon." I used to have a perfectly normal attitude toward these birds.
When I moved last fall to an apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side and discovered that my new neighbors included a colony of pigeons, my first reaction was: Exterminate the brutes!
I cringed at their mating calls each morning.
I watched the squadron of dark flapping figures rising above the courtyard and thought of the sinister flying monkeys in "The Wizard of Oz," although I also agreed with my wife, Dana, when she cursed them as winged rodents.
I attacked them with broom and water pistol.


Vietnam to New Jersey: A Family's 20-Year Quest
It has been 30 years since D. Jacqueline Lee left South Vietnam with her new husband, a Korean businessman.
They moved to Hong Kong, then Switzerland, then Korea, and finally this affluent town in northern Bergen County, where they brought up two children.
Back home in Vietnam, of course, everything was changing rapidly and violently.
Mrs.
Lee, who is now in her 50's, did not know whether her family -- her father, who had been leader of the opposition in the National Assembly of South Vietnam; her stepmother, sister and four brothers -- were dead or alive.
And so for years, she has enlisted every politician and human rights group she could collar to help find them and get them out.

Safety in Italy

After reading Elida Pollex's "warning" (Letters, June 11) to avoid southern Italy because of her unfortunate experience, I would like your readers to know that her misfortune is not an everyday occurrence.


On to an Age Where Rational Doesn't Make Sense
COWARDICE HAS KEPT ME FROM writing about the Millennium, the residential high-rise on Broadway between 67th and 68th Streets that was completed early this year.
I like the building.
But Upper West Siders hate it.
They're outraged by the height of the 46-story building.
They also write mean letters -- more power to them -- and the Millennium isn't so spectacularly great a work of architecture as to merit triggering an avalanche of hate mail by giving it a favorable review.
Indeed, from any rational point of view the building is completely indefensible.
The question I've been turning over, though, is whether it is at all useful to demand that skyscrapers be rational.
I remain a great admirer of the Miesian steel-and-glass tower that defined the American skyline at mid-century.
And my appreciation for this style is, if anything, enhanced by my awareness that Mies's rational esthetic is partly a fraud.
There's nothing rational about the impulse to put up tall buildings.
They're not particularly practical as a building type.
But they are excellent at satisfying emotional cravings: the desire for heights, for views, for feeling superior to your neighbors and for working up a fury among those left standing on the ground.


Martha Clarke's Midlife Dream
IN 1984, THE CHOREOGRAPHER Martha Clarke burst upon the theatrical world with "The Garden of Earthly Delights," a blend of theater, dance and music that was at once beautiful, sensual and terrifying in its re-enactment of the fantastic canvas of Hieronymous Bosch.
His beleaguered humanity suffered the delights of the temporal world, the pitiless retributions of Hell.
Ten dancers cavorted on stage, seemingly naked; they crawled on the floor; tossed about in whirlwinds; they ascended to the rafters.
They literally flew through the air.
Ms.
Clarke appeared to have invented a new art form -- dance-theater, combining movement and narrative with a pictorial analysis of grand themes.
Stanley Kauffmann, writing in The New Republic, said "Garden" transformed "our whole notion of theater." It "epitomizes everything that is unique" about the theater, he wrote, "its grace, its capacity for inspiring awe."


After Frantic Off Season, N.F.L. Gets Down to Business as Not-Quite-Usual
It has been a busy off season for the National Football League, with two new expansion teams set to kick off the 1995 season and a record 179 free agents changing teams.
Six teams changed head coaches and there were 18 new defensive coordinators hired in the league.
New faces, new places (Rams in St. Louis, Raiders back in Oakland) and new ideas will converge in earnest beginning this week when all of the N.F.L. teams will be in training camp.
The Carolina Panthers have been at training camp -- voluntary camp -- at Wisconsin-Steven Points since July 8.
The Jets will be the last team to officially open when they get started on Tuesday.

Mother in South Carolina Guilty Of Murder in Drowning of 2 Sons
A jury tonight found Susan Smith guilty of two counts of murder, one for each of the little boys she left under the water of John D. Long Lake.
Mrs.
Smith trembled but her eyes were dry as a clerk read off the verdict in a state Circuit courtroom.
The 12-member jury took two and a half hours to decide what Mrs.
Smith, 23, had already confessed to, that last Oct. 25 she allowed her car to roll down a boat ramp and into the lake as her two children, strapped in their car seats, cried and screamed inside.


Q. &amp; A.
Binders: Do They Seal Deals?
Q Are there advantages to using a binder in purchasing real estate?
Will a binder hold together a transaction until a detailed contract of sale can be written up and agreed to by the buyer and seller? . . .
Dominic Whitaker, Yonkers.
A Peter Bell, chairman of Balch Realty, a buyer's broker based in Bronxville, N.Y., said that as a representative of buyers only in real estate transactions, he favors the use of binders.


A QUESTION FOR: Tim McCarver
Q: What's the most boring part of baseball?
A: When the pitcher gets on base and they stop the game to bring him a jacket -- so the guy's arm won't get cold.
That's boring.
What does he need a jacket for?
His arm's not going to get cold.
Another boring part is the small talk a first baseman will make with a base runner.
They'll ask: "How ya hittin' 'em? How's the family?" And they could care less.
It's the "Have a nice day" syndrome.
I hated it, and  [ Hall of Fame pitcher ]  Bob Gibson really hated it.
One time, against the Expos, Bob got on and  [ first baseman ]  Ron Fairly told him, "Hey, you're throwing well." Fairly came up to bat a couple innings later and Gibson hit him square in the ribs.
I think more players ought to retaliate like that.


July 16-22; Tax Fraud Trips Up 2 Old Sluggers
Two aging stars from baseball's seemingly more innocent days turned up in Brooklyn last week, but this was no return to the sunshine of Ebbets Field.
Duke Snider, who hit 407 home runs in 18 seasons and starred in center field for the Brooklyn Dodgers in their headiest days, and Willie McCovey, who hit 521 in 22 seasons, were there to plead guilty to tax fraud charges in Federal Court.
In both cases, the accusations involved failure to report tens of thousands of dollars in income from memorabilia shows and promotional appearances over the course of several years; a 1989 sports memorabilia show in Atlantic City figured in both sets of charges.


Where the Thrills of Old Keep Coming Round
THE VIEW OF THE WESTERN Pennsylvania hills and the rusting mills lining the Monongahela River could hardly be better.
But the perch leaves something to be desired: I'm dangling from a steel cable, 200 feet above the pavement.
The idea of the Skycoaster, the hottest ride at Kennywood Park, just east of Pittsburgh, is to simulate bungee jumping.
And I've just remembered that bungee jumping was pretty far down my to-do list, just behind swimming the Bosphorus.


Financing a Legal Education
To the Editor:
I would like to thank you for "Bridging the Income Gap After Law School" (July 2), regarding the need for many law students to finance their educations, and the uphill battle many of them face in repaying those student loans.


Julia Gross, Andrew Judelson
Julia Lynne Gross, the daughter of Norma and Richard Gross of Spring Lake Heights, N.J., was married yesterday to Andrew Rundin Judelson, the son of Lucille Evans of Weston, Conn., and the late Stephen Judelson.
George Hunter Roberts, a town justice of Lewisboro, N.Y., performed the ceremony at Le Chateau, a restaurant in South Salem, N.Y.
Mrs.
Judelson, 26, teaches the seventh grade at Saxe Middle School in New Canaan, Conn.
She graduated from Tulane University and received her master's degree in education from Sacred Heart University.
Her father is an avionics program manager at Vitronics Inc., a contracting company in Eatontown, N.J.


A Singer Lends Her Name to a Camp
On a sunlit summer day, near the still waters of Lake Beaver, 30 children sat nervously under a white tent, waiting to perform for the pop singer Mariah Carey.
They had chosen Ms.
Carey's song "Hero" to sing at the dedication of Camp Mariah, the Fresh Air Fund's career awareness camp that was being named in her honor.
"I met her before," said Sonseray Cummings, a 13-year-old from the Bronx, "She's a regular person. She's a superstar, but she's down to earth."


Value of Insurance Agents
To the Editor:
"Life Insurance Without Those Sales Charges" (June 18) promotes the virtues of fee-only financial planners but gives short shrift to the benefits of working with a professional agent in the purchase of life insurance products.


French Intellectuals Wanted Truth Told; The Children

It was with great joy that I read your report on President Jacques Chirac's redeeming admission of official French culpability in the fate of thousands of Jews during World War II (news article, July 17).


Out of Burundi, a Star Runner Lights Up the Sky
The memories of most young athletes are stocked with images of their predecessors.
A high school quarterback closes his eyes and sees Joe Montana or Dan Marino.
A youngster dribbles a soccer ball and draws on Jurgen Klinsmann or Maradona.
A sprinter cannot escape Carl Lewis.
But Venuste Niyongabo's sporting memory bank is nearly empty.


Corrections
An article last Sunday about the reaction of staff members to the closing of New York Newsday misstated the timing of a letter from the publisher of The Herald Tribune, John Hay Whitney, to a staff member, Dennis Duggan, who later became a New York Newsday columnist.
The letter, dated Aug. 16, 1966, was written after a decision was made not to resume publication of The Herald Tribune; it was not written after the demise of The World Journal Tribune, which closed in May 1967.


July 16-22: Chicago Politics; In This Heat Wave, The City Didn't Work
The heat wave that claimed more than 400 lives in Chicago this month was unprecedented in the city's history but the political finger-pointing that started before the first funerals was as common as the lies of a cheating husband.
Weather and politics are old allies in Chicago.
At least one mayor, Michael Bilandic, was thrown out of office by the voters in 1979 for the way he handled a snowstorm.
Now, bad weather has put the current Mayor, Richard M. Daley, on the defensive.
For much of last week, he was ducking charges that his administration moved too slowly to warn the city, especially its elderly, about the heat's deadly potential.


Women at Work on Sand Traps and Swings
DESPITE a heavy influx of women in recent years, golf has remained a game dominated by men, and in more ways than one -- the vast majority of teaching golf professionals are men, as are course superintendents and most others connected with the game.
Even in the Ladies Professional Golf Association, which operates the women's professional tour, the commissioner, the deputy commissioner and the special assistant to the commissioner are all men.
And at many country clubs women still are not allowed to play on weekends, or at least not until late in the day on Saturdays and Sundays.
Indeed, not much has changed in the way the game is run since Angela Aulenti was handed a sawed-off 3-iron at the age of 8 at the Longshore Golf Course in her hometown of Westport and began hacking away at some golf balls almost 30 years ago.
Yet, in a way, Ms.
Aulenti has been something of a pioneer.


Reviving the Rialto
Once upon a time, the intersection of Broadway and 42d Street on the island of Manhattan in the city of New York was the glittering "crossroads of the world" -- Times Square, the exciting center of entertainment in America's grandest metropolis.
The glitter turned into sleaze some years ago, when theaters that staged the likes of Ziegfeld Follies became XXX-rated movie houses.
But the good old days appear to be coming back now, in fancy -- and costly -- modern dress.
Led by the Walt Disney Company with a generous helping of city and state subsidies, tentative plans for key elements of the sleaziest block in the neighborhood -- the stretch of 42d between Seventh and Eighth Avenues -- have now become firm.
With the signing of three substantial deals this month, others seem more likely.


True Believers Gather To Honor White Race
Beneath tall, whispering pines and a large swastika banner hanging from a church tower, white supremacists from around the country and Canada gathered here this weekend for the Aryan World Congress, an annual celebration of the white race and anti-Semitism.
Amid Sieg Heil salutes and with Nazi symbols festooning their clothes, participants paid $45 each to enter the gates of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian Aryan Nations for two days of speeches and ceremonies, which will be highlighted by tonight's solemn cross-burning service.


When Business Partners Are Marriage Partners
JAMI AND KLAUS HEIDEGGER met in 1982 when she was an aerobics instructor and he was a rising star on Austria's Olympic ski team.
Three years later they were married, and now they run Kiehl's, a Manhattan-based cosmetics company.
The enterprise, with yearly revenue of $10 million, surely makes money.
But, in the couple's eyes, it makes their marriage, too.

Yes, Things Have Changed, But the Biltmore Swings On
To the Editor:
Your article about the deejay Ian Bromfield a.k.a.
Hawkman spinning his stuff at the Biltmore Ballroom in Flatbush ("Hawkman's Circuit," July 9) brought back some memories.
Between 1954 and 1963 my three cousins, my brother and I were Bar Mitzvahed at the Biltmore, then run by the always debonair Mr.
Hechtman (as kids, we never called adults by their first names).


DIARY
STOCKS Sugar Blues for the Market Let's see.
The stock market soars, led by technology stocks.
Microsoft, the highest of tech, reports surprisingly strong earnings.
So naturally the market nose-dives, led by technology stocks.
At one point in Wednesday's free-fall, in fact, with the Dow down 130, Microsoft shares were $18 below where they'd been two days earlier.
What happened?
Perhaps it was that dreaded "correction" -- an odd term implying that the notoriously illogical market has some "correct" level from which foolish investors deviate.
Or perhaps it was the Wall Street equivalent of gorging on sweets and then crashing after the sugar high.
In any case, traders pulled out of it and the market held steady for the rest of the week.
Bill Gates won't have to go to work at McDonald's.
GREENSPAN WATCH Flirting With Clarity Alan Greenspan may have had something to do with that market bump, too.
If he ever made himself totally clear, of course, the Dow would probably rise or fall 1,000 points in a day.
There's no remote danger of him doing that, but last week he did skate perilously close to clarity, saying the economy "may have passed the point of maximum risk." In his usual hedging fashion, he added, "We have certainly not yet reached the point" where no risk remains.
But the markets seemed to fix on his optimism, which might mean he has no plans for further interest-rate cuts.
Or it might not.
ELECTRONICS U.S.
TV Maker?
No Such Thing Considering that the average American lives and breathes by the almighty Tube, you'd think making TV sets would be the ideal home-town business.
Far from it.
Yes, many of the names sound all-American: G.E., RCA, Motorola, Zenith, Magnavox.
But G.E. and RCA sets are sold by Thomson of France, Magnavox sets by the Dutch company Philips, and Motorola sets have been renamed Quasars by their Japanese manufacturer, Matsushita.
Zenith held on alone -- until last week.
A South Korean company called LG Electronics, which makes the Goldstar brand, bought control of Zenith.
Now Americans can only sit and watch, at which they're proven experts.
TRANSPORTATION Metro-North Strike: Never Mind For all the fuss, you'd think there had been a strike.
Westchester and Connecticut commuters fretted or stayed home or plotted the least painful trek to the subway's far reaches.
They watched and waited and talked, talked, talked -- the Strike That Wasn't provided endless conversational fodder.
But then Metro-North pulled a trick out of its hat -- a Railway Labor Act cooling-off period -- and, Presto!, no strike threat for four months.
Negotiators can get some sleep now, and commuters, after three days at the edge of their train seats, are left wondering whether the whole mess will be back in November.
And why does no one mention, by the way, that Metro-North hasn't even raised New York fares for over five years?
TOBACCO Is the Marlboro Man Happy?
A survey out last week showed a sharp rise in teen-age smoking -- a big surprise, since that rate had held steady while adult smoking fell.
But now, a tough question: Is this good news or bad for the tobacco industry?
Last month Philip Morris announced a plan to cut smoking by minors, so presumably it would find this news disturbing.
Yet rarely does anyone but a teen-ager start smoking, and if they don't start, there'll be no customers.
But let's take Philip Morris at its word, making the next question this: How do you keep kids from starting?
It's already illegal to sell minors cigarettes, of course, but that means little.
Another survey shows that, nationwide, minors can buy cigarettes 75 percent of the places they try.
And why is Albert Dunlap smiling?
Well, he's chairman of Scott Paper, and he could wind up with $100 million.
Nothing to, uh, sneeze at.
FRAUD Twice Bitten at Towers?
Two years ago, the gloom was deep for creditors of Towers Financial.
Towers descended into bankruptcy; its founder, Steven Hoffenberg, pleaded guilty to fraud, and creditors were out hundreds of millions in an unimaginably vast Ponzi scheme.
Then came that fuzzy, golden moment when the pure of heart ride in and do their virtuous best to patch things up.
A Los Angeles businessman named John Hall entered the scene, with the hope that he'd do all he could for creditors with Towers' tattered remains.
But the fairy tale ends there.
A lawsuit now contends that Mr.
Hall, too, was merely intent on lining his own pockets -- that he siphoned millions from the patched-up venture by having it pay grossly inflated prices for worthless assets.
REGULATION Safety Rules: Hard to Kill Business is dying to get rid of a lot of environmental, health and safety regulations, and it seemed the reigning Republicans would oblige them.
Regulation-slaying legislation, way up there on Congress's checklist, was moving along nicely.
But last week, outnumbered Democrats managed to kill it, borrowing the tactic that had sunk Henry Foster's chance to be Surgeon General: talk it to death.
And as with Dr.
Foster, backers of the bill couldn't quite come up with the votes to cut off debate.
"I regret that we have failed the American people again," said Bob Dole, who would have loved to add the bill to his resume as he applies for that job up Pennsylvania Avenue.
But environmentalists surely saw no failure.
PUBLISHING Let 'em Read Balance Sheets "I like our core businesses," said Mark Willes.
Well, if you say so.
It was a bit hard to tell last week.
Mr.
Willes, after all, is the new head of Times Mirror, whose "core business" is newspapers, and he had just closed New York Newsday, cutting 750 jobs.
Just days later, as part of a broad sweep of the broom, he said he would cut 1,000 more newspaper jobs, including 700 at The Los Angeles Times.
Yes, costs must be cut, shareholders must be kept cozy and warm, and Mr.
Willes, once a General Mills financial executive, is certainly trying to do that.
"Core businesses" -- that's the way business people talk, not journalists.


In the Region/Westchester; How Yonkers Parcels Out Former Iona Campus
AFTER two and a half years of uncertainty, the fate of the 21-acre Yonkers campus of Iona College, near the banks of the Hudson River, was decided last month when the City Council approved the city's purchase of two-thirds of the site for use by its school district.
Iona acquired the campus in 1989 from Elizabeth Seton College, but shut it down just four years later because of financial difficulties and put it on the market.


We Can't Afford Luxury of Financing the Arts; Package Deal
To the Editor:
"Legislators Against the Arts" (editorial, July 19) is misleading, inaccurate and a disservice to your readers.
I voted against the Chabot amendment to strike the $99.5 million in the Interior Appropriations bill for the National Endowment for the Humanities and against the Stearns amendment to cut $10 million more from the $99.5 million in the bill for the National Endowment for the Arts.
Both amendments -- the only ones considered affecting these agencies -- were defeated.


So, Where Is Strawberry?
The wait for Darryl Strawberry, building to ever-increasing dramatic heights, dragged on yesterday without a sighting.
Speculation had raged that the former Met and New York's most noted prodigal son would be called up by the Yankees from Class AAA Columbus in time for today's game.
However, the day passed without the required roster move and so, too, might today, when the Yankees play the third game of their four-game series against Texas.


Gale Kaufman, Michael van Biema
Gale Deborah Kaufman, a vice president of new program initiatives at the New York City Housing Partnership, a nonprofit developer of affordable housing, is to be married today to Michael Stephen van Biema, a director of operations for the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
Rabbi Donna Berman is to perform the ceremony at the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park.
Ms.
Kaufman, who is 33 and is keeping her name, graduated from Brandeis University and received an M.B.A. from Columbia University.
She is a daughter of Richard and Rosalind Kaufman of Harrison, N.Y.
The bride's father is an international economic consultant and financial adviser in Harrison.
Her mother is a partner in the Jacob D. Fuchsberg law firm in New York, a practice founded by Judge Fuchsberg of Rye, N.Y., who is the bride's maternal grandfather and who retired from the New York State Court of Appeals in Albany.


Soccer as Social Glue
Over the last few weeks, thousands of Central and South American immigrants have ventured to Jackson Heights, Queens, to watch soccer matches beamed from Uruguay.
The America Cup tournament provides them an intense moment of reconnection to their homelands.

Law Helps Mental Hospitals Screen for Violence
A new law giving state mental hospitals access to the criminal records of patients will allow the hospitals to intensify their monitoring of potentially dangerous patients, with the aim of preventing violent encounters with the public, officials said yesterday.
The law, signed Friday at the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens by Gov.
George E. Pataki, was prompted by dozens of escapes by mental patients who had been committed by the courts.
One of the most publicized cases was that of Reuben Harris, who is accused of leaving the grounds of the Manhattan Psychiatric Center on Wards Island in January and pushing a 63-year-old woman to her death under a subway train.


For Guide Dogs, Boot Camp Is Tough (No Chewing Allowed)
BILLIE GATES was led by her instructor into a large room and seated in a folding chair.
Akir was led in to the other end of the room through a sliding glass door.
She sat nervously listening for a moment and then called out in a voice full of anticipation, "Akir, come." In an instant, Akir bolted across the room and jumped on Mrs.
Gates's lap and began licking her face.
This was the first step in breaking down the walls of darkness.
For Billie Gates, a 56-year-old blind housewife from Huntsville, Tex., this joyful encounter was the beginning.
For Akir, a black Labrador retriever, the union with Mrs.
Gates was the result of careful scientific breeding, a strict selection process and rigorous training.
Akir is one of more than 5,000 guide dogs that have been bred and trained by Guiding Eyes for the Blind to enable the visually impaired to live with independence and dignity.


A Classic Tale Springs From the Cupboard
The Indian in the Cupboard  Hal Scardino, Litefoot, Rishi Bhat, David Keith Directed by Frank Oz PG 97 minutes
In this interpretation of Lynne Reid Banks's classic book, 9-year-old Omri discovers he can bring his toys to life by placing them inside an old cupboard.
First, he transforms a plastic toy Indian into a living three-inch-tall man.
Then he brings a toy cowboy to life and sets off a war.


The Master Of Creation In 26 Minutes
UNTIL HE DIED ON THE FOURTH OF JULY AT the age of 52, the most famous artist on the face of the earth, and I use the word artist loosely, may well have been Bob Ross.
His name doesn't ring a bell?
Don't panic; you're not going to find him in the standard reference books.
You'd do better to go channel-surfing on your television, which for the last dozen years was Ross's domain.
He was the bearded, fuzzy-haired host of "The Joy of Painting," the public television series on which he gently guided couch potatoes through the intricacies of painting a landscape in 26 minutes.
Speaking in an anodyne voice much like the one police officers use to coax jumpers off ledges, Ross encouraged viewers to paint "happy little clouds" and insisted that anyone who followed his simple instructions could succeed.
He provided art's version of "A Better Body in 30 Days." Each week, millions of viewers, from Akron to Ankara, from Harrisburg to Hong Kong, tuned in -- a whopping 97 percent, according to Ross's calculation, just to hear his voice.
His laid-back on-screen image belied his off-screen drive as a businessman.
He wrote popular books with easy-to-follow recipes for painting snowcapped mountains and lakeside vistas.
He designed courses to train instructors, hundreds of whom have spread across the country, preaching the gospel according to Bob.
He even marketed his own line of art supplies, with his smiling face emblazoned on each tube of paint.


Maria L. Siff, Philip L. Yang Jr.
Maria Lisa Siff, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Andrew P. Siff of New York, is to be married today to Philip Lim Yang Jr., the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Yang of Manila.
The Rev.
Sam Matarazzo is to perform the ceremony at the Roman Catholic Church of St.
Vincent Ferrer.
The bride, 33, was until recently a senior appellate court attorney for the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court, First Department, in Manhattan.
She graduated magna cum laude from Barnard College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and received a law degree from Columbia University.
Her father is a lawyer in New York.
Her mother, Julie Cummings Siff, is a broker at Brown Harris Stevens, a real estate company in New York.

IN SHORT: FICTION
MEMNOCH THE DEVIL  The Vampire Chronicles. By Anne Rice. Knopf, $25.


Let Affirmative Action Die
As an ideology, affirmative action in 1995 is beginning to resemble Soviet Communism in 1989.
Outside the sheltered elites, the majority of people loathe it.
The circumstances in which it was dreamed up no longer exist.
It is clearly teetering, its legitimacy under mortal threat.
The decision by the University of California's Board of Regents to abolish preferences in its admissions policy is the unmistakable sound of a wall coming down.
President Clinton doesn't understand this.
There is no doubt that he is earnest in his defense of racial social engineering.
His speech on Wednesday was moving and eloquent: one of those moments when conviction and this President seem to coincide.
His evident sincerity at least called to mind why many of us backed his candidacy three years ago.


Unnatural Light
Artistic success and a lasting reputation depend on talent, timing, a healthy dose of self-promotion and an extensive network of collaborators.
By the time he started making photographic portraits in 1854, Felix Tournachon, known as Nadar, had already established a name as a writer and a caricaturist.
He seemed to know everyone in Parisian intellectual and artistic circles; he later claimed to have 5,000 friends.
Many of them sat for him, and Nadar's images of French writers and artists are considered among the best photographic portraits ever made.
NADAR (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Abrams, $65) includes some of the photographer's work from his most creative years.
As restless as he was enterprising, Nadar (1820-1910) used electric light to photograph Paris's catacombs and sewers, but most of his artistic passion was spent on portraiture.
Thanks to technological advances, sitters no longer needed to be clamped rigidly into place.
This freedom, along with his use of light, large prints and simple compositions, allowed Nadar to achieve his characteristic vitality.
Most of his subjects -- including Daumier, Bernhardt and Delacroix -- are fully engaged with the photographer and, by extension, with the viewer.
Commercial success nudged Nadar into producing more conventional images typical of the Second Empire, but his restless spirit soon found a new fad -- ballooning; in 1858 Nadar produced the world's first aerial photographs.
Maria Morris Hambourg, a curator of photographs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, provides a lively examination of Nadar's early years; essays by Francoise Heilbrun, a curator of photographs at the Musee d'Orsay, and Philippe Neagu, another curator there who died in 1994, illuminate French culture, intellectual life and photography in the 19th century.

NOT SO FAST
HERE'S A SHORT CHEMISTRY LESSON.
Grasp it and you will grasp the reason the environmental era has barely begun; perhaps you will grasp the history of the next 50 years.
Put a gallon of gasoline in the tank of your car and go out for a drive.
Assuming your engine's well tuned, burning that gallon of petroleum should put about half a pound of carbon in the form of carbon monoxide -- CO -- into the air.
A generation ago that number was closer to one pound; by decade's end, as new technologies clean the exhaust, it should drop to barely a tenth of a pound.
The steady decrease in CO emissions, as well as in those of nitrous oxide and particulates, is the reason the air is clearer and safer now in Los Angeles than it was a generation ago.


Blood Transfusion Is Focus of Inquiry
The State Department of Health has begun an investigation to determine whether a paramedic with the city's Emergency Medical Service, injured in a car accident, was given the wrong blood during a transfusion at Coney Island Hospital.
Officials with the union for the E.M.S. workers have charged that the 30-year-old paramedic, Ira Medjuck, was given two units of the wrong blood type hours after he had undergone surgery on Thursday to repair extensive internal injuries.


Richard L. Dugoff, Rachel J. Gordon
Rachel Jessica Gordon, a daughter of Carole and Neal Gordon of New York, was married last evening to Richard Lawrence Dugoff, the son of Dr.
Sandra Dugoff and Howard Dugoff, both of Potomac, Md.
Rabbi Richard Chapin performed the ceremony at the Water's Edge, a restaurant in Long Island City, Queens.
Mrs.
Dugoff, 27, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.
She and her husband received M.B.A. degrees from Columbia University.
She is an associate product manager at Best Foods, the consumer products manufacturer, in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
Her father is a vice president and the general counsel of Cartier International, the jewelry company, in New York.
Her mother is the owner of Carole Gordon Associates, an advertising agency in New York.


Hooked on Boy Books
BOOKSTORES AND LIBRARIES CAN DIVIDE up their books however they want, but there are really only two important categories: boy books and girl books.
Boy books are biographies of dead presidents, books by almost any Eastern European intellectual ("How much Solzhenitsyn have you gotten through?" sneers a woman friend) or anything else in which the point is the ideas (Italo Calvino), the landscape (Cormac McCarthy) or the action (Robert Ludlum).
It is generally guys who are in thrall to Pete Dexter or Tom Clancy.


A Barbecue Restaurant With Down-Home Style
NEW YORK is a barbecue wasteland, where sauce slathered on sliced roast beef is often called barbecue.
Knowledgeable barbecue lovers often take Horace Greeley's advice.
They go west or south or anywhere else.
They certainly do not go east to Long Island.
Aside from a few tiny, funky, reasonably authentic joints, there is nowhere to go for pulled pork, slabs of ribs, chopped beef or smoked pork sausage.
Therefore, the opening last month of Rick's Smokin' Barbecue, a nearly 200-seat restaurant at 292 Merrick Road in Amityville (691-4423), was big news.


Women Profit From Club Experience
ON a cool Tuesday evening in a living room on Mayhew Avenue here, Sandy Constabile laid out plates of chocolate-chip cookies and a carafe of coffee.
For the next two hours, she and another half-dozen women talked stocks.
Ms.
Constabile is the unofficial president of the Optimists Investment Club, a group of women in their 40's and 50's who meet each month to discuss -- and play -- the stock market.
Since 1987, they have each paid $400 a year into the club's stock fund, and together they have amassed a portfolio worth $51,698, including nearly $10,000 in profits.
But more important, they say, they have become smarter about investing.
"We're more concerned about the educational aspect than we are about how much money we make," said a club member, Suzanne Carpenter.


To Be Young, Russian and Middle-Class
They are from 23 to 26 years old, all of them devotees of capitalism, and all doing just fine in Russia's new free market.
They, too, are the "new rich," at least comparatively, and there isn't a criminal among them.
Instead, the four Russians -- Dmitri Blekher, a real-estate agent; Yelena Shalneva, a press officer; Sergei Skatershchikov, a financial analyst, and Leonid Bershidsky, a journalist -- are part of an emerging class of young professionals, similar to those in almost any Western country.


A Diva Renews Her Ties to the Earth and Reflects
A SUMMER MORNING IN SKANE, the southernmost province of Sweden; green fields alternate with the golden hue of mustard flower.
At the 12th-century church of her native parish, Birgit Nilsson, one of the greatest singers of the century, now in retirement at 77, freshened the flowers at the grave of her parents, Nils and Justina Svensson.
Above her father's name is inscribed the word "Lantbrukare" ("Land Cultivator").
"He was the sixth generation of farmers," Ms.
Nilsson said.
She translated lines from an old hymn that are engraved on the stone: "One generation follows another,/ The pilgrims' song is never silenced in heaven." She sang the opening phrase softly, almost to herself, cherishing the simple melody.


Theological Spin
To the Editor:
I suppose all interpretations of "Hamlet" have validity  [ "Other Methods, Other Madness and Always Slings and Arrows," July 2 ] .
But is our generation so antireligious that it can't do more than pay lip service to the religious issues in "Hamlet"?


CHATTER: Censor the Internet; Taking Responsibility
What, if anything, should be done to limit sexually explicit material on the Internet?
It should be the user's responsibility to determine what should and should not be seen on the computer.
And there is software available to block pornographic stuff.
Leave the Government out of our communications superhighway!
They have too much control already.

George T. Douris, 67, Reporter And Public Relations Executive
George T. Douris, a New York public relations executive whose clients benefited from his prominence in the city's Greek-American community and the extensive contacts he cultivated during his years as a newspaper reporter covering City Hall, died on Friday at the Roosevelt Hospital Division of St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.
He was 67 and lived in Manhattan.
His family said the cause was prostate cancer.


On the Roads: 12 Trouble Spots To Avoid This Week (if You Can)

One lane from upper and lowel level of George Washington Bridge to westbound Route 4 closed, through Nov. 15.


Some Familiar Faces, From Foreign Places
IN spite of the dry soil and soaring temperatures, some plants are getting along just fine this summer.
They are called weeds.
These particular plants are quite clever.
They huddle near ornamentals as if to disguise themselves, or worse, they grow so close in and under favored plants that they are sometimes not seen.

A Classic Tale Springs From the Cupboard
Kids  Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chloe Sevigny, Rosario Dawson Directed by Larry Clark Unrated 95 minutes
A group of New York teen-agers spend 24 hours talking about sex, seeking sex, having sex, buying drugs and using drugs.
The story begins with a seduction and ends with an all-night party that looks like a cross between "La Dolce Vita" and Jonestown.
Much of the action takes place in apartments whose resident adults seem to be out of town or nonexistent.
The main character, Telly (Mr. Fitzpatrick), makes it his goal to deflower two virgins in one day.
Every event in the film takes on new meaning when one character tests positive for the AIDS virus.


Survivors Tell of Serb Atrocities in Fallen Enclave
Selik Hasamovic's arms, powerful from years of working in the mines, looked even stronger today, stripped of all but skin and muscle after 12 days of scrounging for food in the mountains.
His arms hung bare from the shoulders of his plaid shirt, for he had ripped off the sleeves to wrap around his badly swollen feet.
He and thousands of other men had been on the run from the Serbian Army since the Serbs captured the United Nations-designated "safe area" at Srebrenica two weeks ago.
They gave their accounts today, and they and United Nations officials said there had been signs -- though no firm evidence -- that soldiers from the regular Yugoslav Army had joined Bosnian Serbs in the attack.


Take Cuttings and Watch Out for Pests
Take cuttings of fragrant geraniums now, while plants are thriving outside.
I stick five-inch cuttings all about the pots on my roof garden, where other plants provide enough shade to protect the cuttings from too-bright sun while they are growing roots.
I've been amazed to see new leaves after only a few weeks.
Fragrant geraniums are some of my favorite winter house plants; just brushing against a leaf can send the fresh fragrance of lemon or peppermint into the air.
This is a good time to repot house plants if they are root-bound or need dividing.
Soak old pots in a solution of nine parts water to one part bleach; scrub with a wire brush.
This guards against spread of disease or insects.
Never increase the pot diameter for a crowded plant by more than three inches.


Paige Smith, Kenton Jernigan
Paige Smith, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Robert Hoyt Smith of Pine Bluff, Ark., was married yesterday to Kenton Jernigan, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Samuel Jernigan of Newport, R.I.

Dollar Differential
To the Editor:
In his article "Americans in a Land of Opportunity: Europe"  [ July 2 ] , Alan Riding neglects to explain why young American writers and painters no longer go to Europe to develop as artists.
Besides the growing insularity of Americans in general, surely the main reason for this is economic, i.e., the weak dollar.


New York City Need Not Have Lost Its Major Credit Rating
To the Editor:
Regarding Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's July 16 letter and Standard &amp; Poor's downgrading of New York City's debt, I regret the inability of this Mayor to keep the city's one major investment grade rating.
Like it or not, that rating represents the best indicator of the city's creditworthiness. (Fitch's rating is not considered "major" by investors.)


Celebrations of Life After Battling Cancer
PAT COMBS, standing arm in arm with her husband, Ted, surveyed the crowd seated under the white tent.
It was not a group Mrs.
Combs had ever envisioned being part of.
But now that she was, she wanted to remain so, because these were survivors.
"I'm rather new at this," said Mrs.
Combs, 51 years old, whose lung cancer was not diagnosed until this March, when it had spread to her brain.
She underwent surgery and, on a warm recent day, celebrated her survival with other patients at the Helen and Harry Gray Cancer Center at Hartford Hospital.


Giants Can't Wait to Tackle Early Tests
It has been a raucous spring for the Giants, and all indications are that the team is champing at the bit.
One defensive lineman, Chris Maumalanga, hit a free agent linebacker so hard he knocked him down with one punch.
There was one fight in the locker room in which one player body-slammed another.
And this was the off season.


Word for Word / Conspiracy Theories; The Unending Search for Demons In the American Imagination
WHISPERS are stalking the land: The United Nations is poised to take over the United States.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms wants to disarm the country.
Black helicopters are spying on the citizenry.
If today's conspiracy theories provoke a shiver in the night, some bedtime reading may help.
A vast array of Cassandras echo through American history -- usually on the fringes of politics but occasionally accepted by the mainstream.
Through the centuries the villains of the pieces have shifted -- from Masons to Catholics to Jews, for example -- but the alleged plots also have a lot in common: a foreign (or otherwise alien) connection, a tie to big money, a secret organization more powerful than any state.


The Lament of the Belgian Director
Like the Ancient Mariner, Jean-Luc Vandenbroucke sits outside the action, waiting to tug at the sleeves of passersby and recount his tale of woe.
He was at it again today as the Tour de France neared its finish with a 46.5-kilometer (29-mile) individual time trial around the Lac de Vassiviere, a man-made lake near the porcelain center of Limoges in southwest France.
Bowed but not totally broken, Vandenbroucke hailed the latest wedding guest.


Abby Farrington, Thomas O'Malley
Abby Alida Farrington, the daughter of Lillian B. Farrington of Sea Bright, N.J., and the late Edgar R. Farrington, was married yesterday to Thomas Patrick O'Malley, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Francis D. O'Malley of West Islip, L.I.
The Rev.
Joseph W. Hughes, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at Holy Cross Church in Rumson, N.J.
Mrs.
O'Malley, 28, is a sales manager in the subsidiary rights department at John Wiley &amp; Sons, the publishing house, in New York.
She graduated from Hamilton College.
Her father was the chairman of the Cresset Company, a former typography concern in New York.


Output Is Up; So Are Complaints on Quality
GENERAL MOTORS is selling every sport utility vehicle it can make, but a survey has found that soon after they find a home, they generate far more customer complaints than do new cars.
No wonder.
In my test of Chevrolet's Blazer, Tahoe and Suburban, an ashtray fell out of the dash and a seat adjuster proved balky (Blazer), a power window came off its track (Tahoe), a plastic shield on a shoulder belt was not properly fastened and easily came off, screw covers were not secure, another seat was balky and a light under the hood flickered (Suburban).
A colleague recently drove a Tahoe with a Chevrolet engineer and both agreed it had a noisy wiper motor.


Yanks Toil Through The Trouble
Give the 1995 Yankees credit.
Eleven games into what is shaping up to be the 14-game homestand from Hades off the field, the Yankees are regrouping on the field.
Yesterday, shaking off the effects of life in this toddling tabloid town, the Yankees went out and beat the Texas Rangers and the tough Bob Tewksbury.
The Yankees' 7-4 victory was their fourth straight and seventh in 11 games since the All-Star Game break.


SERBS KEEPING UP A HEAVY BARRAGE ON 3 'SAFE AREAS'
Rebel Serbs pressed their attack against the United Nations "safe area" of Zepa in eastern Bosnia today and continued their heavy shelling of Sarajevo.
The Bihac enclave, in northern Bosnia, also came under fire.
The attacks came a day after NATO allies threatened the Bosnian Serbs with heavy bombing if they attacked Gorazde, another United Nations-declared "safe area."

Mayor Finds Obstacles In Regulating Sex Shops
It would seem to be an easy triumph for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's swashbuckling quality-of-life campaign: drive the sex shops out of residential neighborhoods and darken those flashy triple-X storefronts once and for all.
But judging from the range of responses, passing the new zoning regulations for sex-related businesses may prove to be an uphill battle for the Mayor.
As the City Planning Commission prepares to hold public hearings on the zoning amendment Wednesday and Thursday, the city is sharply divided on whether the proposal is too restrictive or does not go far enough.
Manhattan and Brooklyn oppose it for very different reasons; Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island support it with modifications.


How a City Block Became a Spiritual Path
At first glance, Parsons Boulevard between Normal Road and 87th Avenue looks like any other row of small businesses.
There's a stationery store, health food shop, florist, barber, dry cleaner, luncheonette, clothing boutique, grocery and law office.
But spend a few minutes inside and outside these stores, and some unusual things become very apparent.
The stationery and health food stores are each called "Guru," and many of the clean-cut, physically fit employees and customers in these stores wear shirts with poems inscribed on them.
Most of the stores have posters in their windows promoting the teachings of Sri Chinmoy, an Indian spiritual leader.


North and South Meet in the Italian Marches
ABOUT three hours' drive east of Rome lies the Marches region of Italy (le Marche, in Italian), extending from the Apennines to the Adriatic.
The region is characterized by fortified hill towns, rugged mountains and deep gorges, and a flat coastal ribbon.
Its name derives from its medieval role as border land (a marca), and even today it is sort of a buffer zone between north and south, as its cuisine shows: very generally speaking, the affinities in the northern half of the region are with neighboring Emilia-Romagna and in the south with Abruzzo.
We spent a long weekend in the northern Marche provinces of Ancona and Pesaro, mostly near the sea, about a fortnight before the great July invasion of beachgoers along the Adriatic Coast.
We discovered a small group of fine restaurants whose owners and chefs are dedicated to interpreting the region's best ingredients and traditions and to its excellent wines.
The gracious Marchigiani don't expect visitors, even from as near as Rome, to be knowledgeable about the region's products, even its famous verdicchio wine, and are eager to explain and suggest.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
Indomitable Triathloner
COMPETING in a one-person triathlon across Long Island offers positives and negatives.
A big positive is that if you finish you always come in first.
A big negative is trying to finish.
Long Island traffic waits for no man.
Especially a lone man who is trying to bike, run and swim across the busiest byways.
"The logistics are a nightmare," said Joe Tantillo of Patchogue, who competed last weekend in the Cross Island Challenge, the challenge being his own.
Mr.
Tantillo's goal was to travel from Long Island Sound in Port Jefferson to Davis Park on Fire Island.
On land he had to cross busy intersections and railroad tracks.
"So I had to check the train schedules," he said.
Then there was the ferry schedule.


NATO Diplomats Question Details of Plan for Air Raids
Despite the warning by the United States, Britain and France that they would bomb Bosnian Serb forces if they attack the Gorazde "safe area" in eastern Bosnia, senior NATO diplomats and military officers said today that there were serious questions about how the threat would be carried out.
"The history of this conflict is that people often agree to threats on the political level, but when it comes down to the military details, all kinds of objections crop up," one NATO diplomat said.


Vassar Offers Creativity On the Summer Circuit

It is not commerce; it is camaraderie and collaboration.
And it is art.


U.S. Lists 10 Soviet-Built Nuclear Reactors as High Risks
Underscoring previous warnings from Western experts about the dangers of Soviet-built nuclear power plants, a Federal intelligence report says 10 reactors in Slovakia, Lithuania, Russia, Bulgaria and Ukraine face an abnormally high risk of failure.
The danger is attributed to design flaws, tattered economies, political disorder and weak regulatory oversight.

She graduated from Cornell University, from which she also received an M.B.A.
Her father is a writer and a distinguished teaching professor of philosophy at the State University in Binghamton, N.Y.
Her mother was the director of the domestic violence action committee program for Catholic Charities of Chenango County in Norwich, N.Y.
Nan's Place, a safe house for abused women in Norwich, was established in her memory.


Lisa N. Edstrom, Gregory E. Hagin
Lisa N. Edstrom, the daughter of Pamela and Michael J. Edstrom of Brooklyn, was married yesterday to Gregory E. Hagin, a son of Eugene H. Hagin of Princeton, N.J., and the late Rita G. Hagin.
Judge Bert A. Bunyan of the Civil Court of Kings County, officiated on the beach at Lonelyville, on Fire Island.
Ms.
Edstrom, 24, is keeping her name.
She teaches kindergarten at the Mount Kisco (N.Y.) Elementary School.
She graduated from Harvard University and received a master's degree in education from Bank Street College of Education.
Her father, a graphic artist, is also an adjunct professor of graphic arts at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.
Her mother is a social-work supervisor at the Human Resources Administration's Domestic Violence Program in New York.


What's Bill Got That Worked for John, Dick and Yes, Harry
Over the years, people have tried to predict market performance based on such factors as hemline lengths, baseball or football championships and the position of the stars in the sky.
Another favorite tactic is to correlate returns with presidential elections, which may not be so unreasonable after all.
Phoenix Investments, a fund and money management company in Hartford, noted in a recent study that stocks perform best in the third year of a presidential cycle, and the company encourages investors to get in the game before it's too late.


Constitution Island: How It Was Named
Britain does not have a constitution as the June 25 article "Guarding Constitution Island for Its Role in the Revolution" implies: "Originally called Martelaer's Rock, the island was named Constitution by colonists fighting for their rights under the British Constitution." RICHARD SILVERSTEIN Dobbs Ferry Editor's note: Britain does not have a written constitution.
Dr.
Steve Grove, Military Academy Historian at West Point, says that when he speaks to tour groups, questions about the colonists' naming of Constitution Island invariably come up.
He says that the colonists would have been familiar with the British constitution and wanted to show that they were adherents to its concepts.
The British constitution is a collection of documents and unwritten conventions, including the Magna Carta, legal decisons and acts of Parliament.
The Constitution of the United States was not adopted until 1789, well after the naming of Constitution Island.

SO they made a deal: She'd get the huge party-in closet (much bigger than walk-in) and he'd be close to Central Park, where he likes to jog.
Together, they'd find a "bonus" to set their apartment off from those of most of the other wage-slaving, claustrophobic apartment-living New Yorkers.

Wartime Dreams Revisited
WHAT TERM COULD BE more oxymoronic than "wartime nostalgia"?
Does anyone really want a return to the days of Hitler, Hiroshima and Auschwitz?
Yet in America, where no bombs fell and no storm troopers landed during World War II, Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley created a seductive wartime dream world of heroics and hearts and flowers that grows more appealing as the decades slip away.
Fifty years after the end of the World War II, the music that wafted through our national dream life in the early 1940's is regarded by many as the country's finest pop moment.
Nostalgia for the 40's dates back to the early 1970's when Bette Midler scored a top 10 single with "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy," a 1941 Andrews Sisters hit.
More recently, cabaret singers like Maureen McGovern, Andrea Marcovicci and Mary Cleere Haran have devoted entire programs to the 1940's, and Barry Manilow has recorded an album of big-band standards.
Harry Connick Jr. presents himself as a born-in-New-Orleans reincarnation of Frank Sinatra and Dick Haymes.


W.E. Woolfenden, 77, Dies; American Art Archives Chief

He was 77.
A resident of Southbury, Conn., he had retired in 1983 after serving 19 years as director of the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art.

Whitewater: New Ground
It is comforting to learn that after the suicide of Vincent Foster, the troubled deputy counsel to President Clinton, someone in the Government recognized that the White House was contaminating the investigation and had the integrity to say so.
If the Senate's Whitewater committee were merely plowing old ground, as the Administration claims, then it would not be turning up just this sort of valuable new information.
This is stuff that was buried in secrecy and almost covered over by last summer's easygoing hearings run by the President's party.
It may or may not lead to legal charges, but there is no question about the public value of exposing official bungling and lying.


Are America's Wide Open Spaces Too Big for the Small Screen?
HERE's the idea: five young people who have never met board a Winnebago and set off across the country.
Every few days, they get a new clue -- in a pouch around a dog's neck, for example -- that presents them with a new destination and a new challenge, like working at an alligator farm or parachuting out of a plane.
Their adventures, their fights, their accomplishments and their whining -- in short their every move -- is recorded by video cameras.
This is the idea behind "Road Rules," a new MTV series on Monday nights at 10 for the next 13 weeks.
The show draws most obviously on its MTV predecessor "The Real World," a series that put a group of nubile strangers together in a house for several weeks of on-air angst.
But there is also a strong allusion to a more venerable, if often underappreciated television tradition: the road show.
"Road Rules" is "Route 66" with better outfits and more sex.


2-Tier Pricing in Prague: Foreigners Pay More
TOURISTS have become an inescapable part of daily life in this city, a situation that doesn't thrill residents as they try to wend their way around narrow streets clogged with visitors.
More tourists entered the Czech Republic last year -- 100 million, according to the World Tourism Organization -- than visited France.
It is perhaps hardly surprising that some businesses take advantage of the newcomers by charging them substantially higher prices than they charge Czechs.
And in charging, say, double for foreigners, Czech proprietors appear to be protected by the law.
Or let's say one important branch of the Czech Government, the Ministry of Finance, has blessed what has become a two-tiered pricing system.

Polish Tours
To the Editor
Having recently returned from our fourth visit to Poland since 1992, we are happy to report much more positive experiences with the Warsaw-based Our Roots travel agency than the 1990 experiences that Alan Finkelstein described (Letters, April 30).
Our Roots has been fair and professional on two individual tours we arranged and two group tours in which we were involved.
In our just-completed visit, our guide and driver went out of their way to accommodate our needs and respond to our many and varied questions.

Coming to Jersey City: A Path From Bus to Train
On Tuesday, Federal, state and local officials will dedicate the Exchange Place Transit Mall in Jersey City, a pedestrian plaza that bans cars and allows buses only during the morning and evening rush hours.
The plaza, which extends from Hudson and Montgomery Streets east to the Hudson River, is expected to open in two weeks.
It is the first of several such malls N.J.
Transit hopes to construct in Hudson County to encourage more public transit.
Others, in various stages of design, are scheduled for Gateway Park-Ride, just west of Liberty State Park; Hoboken Terminal, Port Imperial in Weehawken and the Vince Lombardi rest area of the New Jersey Turnpike.

Caroline Tso, Theodore Chen
Caroline Gin Tso, a daughter of Arthur Y. Tso and Virginia C. Tso of East Brunswick, N.J., was married yesterday to Theodore Carl Chen, a son of Dr.
Pi-Fuay Chen and Bertha L. Chen of Alexandria, Va.
The Rev.
Dr.
John W. Hayward, a Baptist minister, performed the ceremony in the Kirkpatrick Chapel of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J.
The bride, 29, is an associate at the New York law firm of Levy Phillips &amp; Konigsberg.
She graduated from Rutgers and received her law degree from American University.
Her father is a heat-transfer engineer at the Mobil Research and Development Corporation in Princeton, N.J.
Her mother is the business manager at the Center for Plastics Recycling and Packaging Engineering at the Rutgers campus in Piscataway, N.J.


Seeking Converts for Dianthus
I have always harbored a mild interest in dianthus.
These plants are not difficult to grow, they have a long and colorful history, they're totally in character with my cottage garden and the blossoms are delightfully fragrant.
So I amassed a modest collection of heirloom varieties with names like Inchmery and Queen of Sheba, while keeping an eye peeled for rarities like Bat's Double Red.
But pinks held merely a passing attraction until Rand B. Lee came into my life.
In horticulture there are a handful of ardent souls who exist solely to glorify a certain species.
Salvias, hostas, pelargoniums and clematis all have their champions.
Mr.
Lee is unabashedly dotty about dianthus.


Mr. Gingrich's World
House Speaker Newt Gingrich's views on international affairs have been making quite a splash recently.
Two weeks ago, on "Face the Nation," he breezily suggested that the United States overturn two decades of China policy and recognize Taiwan.
Then he said he did not mean it.
Never mind.
He was inviting further attention to his foreign policy ideas, all the while protesting that he had not really had enough time to polish his thoughts.
Profiled on the front page of last Tuesday's Times, Mr.
Gingrich reminded readers of his rapid rise from a west Georgia assistant professorship to the global stage.
What with most of his attention on domestic affairs these days, he freely acknowledged that when it comes to foreign policy he still has a lot to learn.


In Mark Morris's Utopia, Dancers Are Music
"THE THEATER WAS A VERB before it was a noun." Martha Graham said that, and it sent me straight to my dictionary and back through Middle English and Latin to Greek: "theasthai, to view, from thea, the act of seeing; akin to thauma, meaning miracle." She used to tell that to the acting students who studied dance with her; theater's roots were inseparable from dance and from music of some kind.
Louise Brooks said she learned to act by watching Graham dance and to dance by watching Charlie Chaplin act.
And it's worth remembering that America has made its boldest contributions to theater through musicals and through dance: the spiritual intimacies of modern dance and the social intricacies of vernacular dance.
A play has to depend on the tensions its story and characters incite.
Dances and musicals have tension built into them, tension that starts with the pull between a body and the music it moves to, or between words and music: the demands of speech and the strictures of song.
It's a contest and a courtship from the start; it spurs our senses and keeps our loyalties shifting in unexpected ways. 'L'Allegro, Il Penseroso Ed Il Moderato'
The choreographer Mark Morris's "Allegro, Il Penseroso ed Il Moderato" is a wonderful theater piece.
Created in 1988, it could be seen for a scant four days as part of the current Serious Fun Festival at Lincoln Center.
It gave off a celebratory air at the New York State Theater, with not only the Mark Morris Dance Group on stage but the New York Chamber Symphony, the Pro Arte Chorale and five vocal soloists in the orchestra pit.


Dr. Landesberg, Ms. Schwartz
Helene Elissa Schwartz, the daughter of Joan and Richard Schwartz of Melville, L.I., is to be married today to Dr.
Leonard John Landesberg, a son of Lucy and Dr.
Joseph Landesberg of Rockville Centre, L.I.
Rabbi William Berman is to perform the ceremony at the Woodbury (L.I.) Jewish Center.
The bride, 26, is to become an associate at McKinsey &amp; Company, the management consultant concern in New York, in September.
She graduated summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and from which she also received an M.B.A. degree in May.
Her father retired as a partner in Ernst &amp; Young, the accounting firm in New York.


Advice to a Newspaper Dreamer
Print journalism has become rife with trouble: a strike (Detroit), downsizing (Los Angeles Times) and closings (New York Newsday).
So what would New York Newsday journalists advise a young person about pursuing a newspaper career?
ROBIN POGREBIN JIMMY BRESLIN, columnist: What are you going to do, go to banking?
I would just go into the business.
If you don't come out of rough times in this business, you don't belong.
I came out of the toughest, and I can walk through fire.
They better make sure they have their verbs in order before they start.
If you've got sentences nobody can remember, then you better be allowed to kill yourself.
SHERYL McCARTHY, columnist: I would not encourage a young person to go into journalism.
It's not quite the same as becoming a minister, yet it is a kind of calling.
You really have to be driven.
If you want to have an interesting life, and if you want people to invite you into their homes and tell you their most intimate secrets - that's why you do it.
PETE HAMILL, columnist: It depends on why you're going into it.
If you're going into it in order to have a pension plan, don't do it.
If you want to be famous, go and sell out your community and get a book deal or kill your wife or your husband.
But, if somebody has that crazy, driven need to do it, you must do it.
It was a lot more fun when the field was full of bohemian anarchists who stuck around for a while, threw a typewriter out the window and moved on.
When I broke in, and there were seven functioning newspapers, so at least you could go down the block if some butcher on the copy desk destroyed your masterpiece that morning.
But it's the most honorable work I can think of doing.
Start in Pascaloosa, if you have to.
KAREN ROTHMYER, assistant business editor: If you desperately want to be a newspaper person, do it.
You'll be happy.
It's a great life.
If you're young, you can afford to be out in the middle of nowhere, writing three stories a day.
AT 22, of course you should still do it.
But if you're in your 30's and considering a career shift, I might say, maybe youshould think about it.
If you've got a couple of kids and another 30 years of career ahead of you, I don't know.
Maybe software is the answer, I really don't know.

LUDERS CELEBRATION &lt;&gt;HE&gt;
Westchester redsidents who now own or once owned a Luders-built boat may want to spend some nostalgic time in Stamford hobnobbing with other Luders aficionados.
The city is celebrating a cherished former resident -- the Luders Marine Construction Company -- with a harbor reunion of Luders-made yachts, sailboats and military vessels from Thursday through next Sunday.
Luders's former shipyard, in operation from 1911 to 1968, is now the Yacht Haven West Marina.
Among its more prestigious projects was the America's Cup winner Weatherly and the contender American Eagle as well as Navy minesweepers and patrol craft in World War II.
All Luders boat owners are eligible to join Stamford Historical Society members and former Luders employees at a Connecticut Maritime Association barbecue and beach party Thursday at 6 P.M.
The charge will be $40 for a complete dinner, hors d'oeuvres, wine and beer at Eletson Maritime, 40-44 Signal Road.
Call (203) 622-4014 for reservations.
A musical evening featuring songs of the sea and a box supper aboard the vessel Indian Harbor at Yacht Haven West will cost $25 and begin at 7 P.M. on Friday, and a buffet dinner at the Stamford Yacht Club on Saturday at 8 P.M. will cost $35.
For reservations, call (203) 329-1183.
Nongustatory events unrelated to Luders ownership include a boat-care clinic, especially for old wooden boats, scheduled next Saturday from 9 to 11:30 A.M. at Yacht Haven West, where a Boat Open House and an Antique and Marine Tag Sale will be in progress throughout the day.
Also on Saturday 90-minute harbor tours will depart from the marina at 1 and 3 P.M. and cost $10, while a sunset cruise from 6 to 9 P.M. includes a potluck supper at $25.
Call (203) 323-1978.
Three freebies are a Luders Slide Show on Saturday at 1 P.M. at the Ponus Yacht Club, and on Sunday a Yacht Parade into the harbor at 10 A.M. -- best seen from Cove Island, and a jazz concert at Cove Island Park from 5 to 7 P.M.
Through Sept. 17 an exhibition of Luders boat models, pictures, artifacts and drawings may be seen at the Stamford Historical Society, 1508 High Ridge Road, open Tuesday through Sunday from noon to 4 P.M.
Admission is $2, $1 for children.
Call (203) 329-1183 for more information.
THEATER DOINGS
Carmel's Parks and Recreation Department has reopened its Long Pond Showcase Theater in Sycamore Park, Mahopac, to present its production of the musical "They're Playing Our Song." The book is by Neil Simon, music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Carol Bayer Sager.
The original 1980's Broadway production starred Robert Klein and Luci Arnaz.
Performances are scheduled for Friday and next Sunday at 8 P.M. and Aug. 4 and 6, also at 8 o'clock..
Tickets are $7, $5 for children younger than 13 and adults older than 65.
The Long Pond Enchanted Theater for children will present "Doggie Bone Bare" today and next Sunday at 5 P.M. and on Saturday at 11 A.M.
Tickets are $3.
Call 628-7888 for reservations to both shows.
CZECH BAND
After bluegrass and new grass comes second grass, spelled Druha Trava in Czech.
That is the name of a country band from the Czech Republic, which is making its first appearance at the Towne Crier Cafe in Pawling tonight at 8:30 P.M.
The four-year-old group has performed in the United States and Europe to favorable reviews and recorded briskly selling records in English and Czech.
Their style is original and contemporary but grounded in American bluegrass, the cafe says.
The lead vocalist and guitarist, Robert Krestan, is known as the Bob Dylan of the Czech Republic.
The remaining members are Lubos Malina on banjo, fiddle and sax, Lubos Novotny on Dobro and lap steel, Pavel Malina on guitar and Jiri Meisner on bass.
All of them sing as well.
Tickets are $15.
Fans of Loudon Wainwright 3d's way with a memorable tune and a sharp lyric can catch his performance at the Towne Crier on Friday at 9:30 P.M. for a ticket price of $17.50.
The cafe is at 62 Route 22, and the phone number for reservations is 855-1300.
VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT
People with developmental disabilities like to go to museums, go fishing, bowling and horseback riding or play cards and checkers like anyone else.
But the availability of friends, relatives and even the Westchester Association for Retarded Citizens in White Plains, serving 1,500 children, adults and families, is insufficient to meet the need.
Volunteers interested in taking someone to a sporting event or a concert or spending an hour or so in a mutually agreeable activity two days a month or more should call 428-8330.

C.W. Boldyreff, 85, Anti-Soviet Crusader
Constantin W. Boldyreff, a Russian emigre who fought Soviet Communism as a youth in the Soviet Union and later as a college professor in the United States, died on Tuesday at the Tolstoy Center Nursing Home in Valley Cottage, N.Y.
He was 85.
The son of a general in the White Russian Army who was shot by the Communists in 1932, Mr.
Boldyreff fled to Yugoslavia, where he received an engineering degree, managed British-American mining operations and, by his later account, joined other young Russian emigres in establishing the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, an underground anti-Communist group.

The Day the Jobs Got Up and Moved Away
HERE among the open fields and winding roads of suburban Mercer County, a sprawling steel and brown-brick factory has long provided jobs for hundreds of people, from janitors to rocket scientists.
Opened by RCA in 1958, it foreshadowed a regional economy that would flourish in the 1970's and 80's, as office buildings and corporate campuses sprang up between Princeton and Trenton.
But in recent months, what was once the unthinkable became the inevitable: the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the current owner of the East Windsor factory, joined three other major employers to announce plans to leave Mercer, taking a total of 5,400 jobs.
The losses amounted to 3,200 positions at Lockheed, which designs and manufactures spacecraft; 900 at the Mobil Corporation's research and development office in Hopewell Junction; 800 at Hill Refrigeration in Trenton, and 500 at a condom factory owned by Carter-Wallace, also in Trenton.

Daly Buries Some Old Demons in Auld Sod of Scotland
It was the wildest end to the craziest British Open this Old Course has ever seen, a drama with multiple acts and more twists and turns than the A91 from St.
Andrews down to Edinburgh.
So, when it was all over, when the final triple bogey had been made at the Road Hole and the last whoop and holler had died out among the spires and the alleys of the Auld Grey Toon, it was fitting that the winner was none other than the man the Scots call Wild Thing.
John Daly picked today at this haunted old spot to bury a whole bunch of demons, not to mention all the pre-tournament favorites.
On a hard, cold and windy day, Daly won the British Open in a four-hole playoff over Costantino Rocca of Italy.
He did it by keeping his patience when everybody around him was losing theirs.
He did it by hitting all the shots that conventional wisdom said he couldn't hit.
And, finally, he did it by heeding his own version of the famous Churchill one-line commencement address.


One Killed in Crash of Bus Carrying a Church Choir
A bus carrying a church group from western New York to a religious retreat apparently lost its brakes on a steep hill near Lake George yesterday, crashed through a guardrail and tumbled down a 300-foot embankment, killing one person on board and injuring 31 others, 7 seriously, the authorities said.
The chartered bus crashed at 2:15 P.M. in Bolton Landing, a small town about 70 miles north of Albany and 5 miles east of Interstate 87.
It was about 15 miles south of its destination, Silver Bay.
The weather was clear at the time, said Trooper Robin Walsh, a spokeswoman with the State Police, and because there were no skid marks, the authorities said that the bus driver appeared unable to brake.


Rockies' 4 Homers Bury Jones And Mets
Bobby Jones knew he was in trouble while he was warming up in the bullpen at Coors Field for today's start against the Colorado Rockies.
"Nothing was working," Jones said.
"My breaking ball wasn't moving and my fastball wasn't doing much either. I knew I'd have to try to make some adjustments when I got on the mound."
The Rockies never gave the right-hander a chance to find a workable solution.
By the time the first inning was over, they had pounded Jones for five runs on home runs by Dante Bichette, Vinny Castilla and Ellis Burks.
Burks added a two-run homer in the third, which provided the winning margin in an 8-5 victory, giving the Mets their first two-game losing streak since the All-Star Game break.

Most Wanted; Making History But Not Much News
Michael Jackson's new album is not yet history.
But it's starting to look like old news on the pop charts.
"HIStory: Past and Present," which opened at No. 1 on June 20 and slipped to No. 2 two weeks later, has fallen to fourth place.


Cruise Ship Again Struck By Sickness
One year after an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease struck passengers on the cruise ship Horizon, about 220 passengers on the same ship reported symptoms of salmonella poisoning, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said yesterday.
The sickened passengers, among 1,600 aboard the ship, began suffering diarrhea, stomach cramps and fevers beginning last Tuesday, three days after the Horizon left New York on a weeklong cruise to Bermuda and back, said Bob Howard, a spokesman for the C.D.C. in Atlanta.


Medicare Cuts Will Kill
To the Editor:
Re proposed Republican Medicare cuts masquerading as reforms to expand choice (front page, July 17): Too many seniors and people with disabilities are forgoing food and other basic needs to pay for prescription drugs and nursing care because Medicare won't pay for them.
With $270 billion cut from the Medicare program, our frailest, sickest citizens may have to go without health care altogether.


Kerdyk Now Has Reason to Play Favorites
By her own admission, Tracy Kerdyk was convinced that she was going to "take the L.P.G.A. tour by storm" when she turned professional in the fall of 1989.
Kerdyk could hardly be blamed for her optimism.
She had been a two-time all-American at the University of Miami and the collegiate player of the year in 1988.
That same year, she was named to the Curtis Cup team.
And the year before, Kerdyk had won the Canadian Amateur championship and was runner-up in the United States Women's Amateur championship.

Motorcycle Crash Hurts 6 in Mid-Manhattan


4 Review Finalists For People's Bank
People's Bank has selected four finalists in a review on its account that began last month.
The billings on the account, which had been handled by the TBWA Advertising unit of the Omnicom Group for the last seven years, were estimated at $6 million to $8 million.
Jane Sharpe, a spokeswoman for the bank in Bridgeport, Conn., identified the finalists on Friday as Angotti, Thomas, Hedge in New York; the Earle Palmer Brown North unit of the Earle Palmer Brown Companies in New York; Keiler &amp; Company in Farmington, Conn., and North Castle Partners in Stamford, Conn.
A decision is expected by early fall, she added.


For I.B.M. Faithful, Questions About Windows 95
"Every time I say I am an OS/2 user, I get immediately marginalized," an elderly woman confided to a young man sitting next to her at last week's OS/2 World convention in Boston.
"It's amazing what saying you are an OS/2 user brings out in people."
She could afford to bare her soul in public because she knew that she was surrounded by a sympathetic group: a few thousand devotees of I.B.M.'s long-overshadowed personal computer operating system.


Japanese Schools Are Different, Not Better; Cultural Conditioning
To the Editor:
My 20 years as a student of the Japanese educational system lead me to different conclusions from your July 18 front-page article.


Jury Must Fit Penalty To a Mother's Crime
Although Susan Smith was convicted on Saturday evening in the drowning deaths of her two young sons, the jury's verdict is just a beginning to a whole new parade of testimony and emotions that have tugged at the town of Union, S.C..
As the trial enters its penalty phase today, with execution in the electric chair at stake for the 23-year-old secretary, both sides will have to do what many people in Union dread.
The prosecutors and lawyers will scrape harder at the community that shaped Mrs.
Smith, and the people closest to her will share the blame.


Corrections
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Wednesday about the United States trade deficit in May referred incorrectly to the ranking of the $11.4 billion deficit.
It was a record, but only for the period since January 1992, when the Government changed the way it calculates the figures.
While it is hard to compare the new calculations with earlier ones, other Government statistics indicate that the monthly deficit was consistently larger in 1986 and 1987 than in recent months.


Treasury to Auction Both Bills and Notes
The Treasury's schedule of financings this week will be confined to the bills and notes markets including today's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills and two- and five-year notes being auctioned tomorrow and Wednesday.
By the close of the New York cash market on Friday, traders said, the rate on outstanding three-month bills was 5.43 percent and six-month bills were at 5.43 percent.
In when-issued trading, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.97 percent, and the five-year note at 6.27 percent.


Japan's Leaders to Stay On Despite Poor Election Showing
Voters humiliated Japan's governing coalition in nationwide elections on Sunday, weakening its authority but apparently allowing it to remain in power for the time being.
The immediate result may be to paralyze decision-making even further.
But in the medium term, it could bring forward new general elections and stimulate a far-reaching political realignment in Japan.


How Jewish Ledger Covers Intermarriage
To the Editor:
William Safire (column, July 17), discussing the controversy over the Connecticut Jewish Ledger's decision to reaffirm its policy not to publish announcements of intermarriages, claims the answer to the problem "is not in editors making those who intermarry feel like outcasts."
What Mr.
Safire doesn't understand is that The Ledger is not making anyone an "outcast." It is making a statement about what we feel is, and is not, appropriate for inclusion in a weekly Jewish newspaper.


Chief's Suspension Is Sought
A Town Councilman says Chief Robert Spina of the West Orange police should be suspended while an investigation is conducted into findings by a Superior Court judge that Mr.
Spina abused his wife.
On Friday, Judge Katherine Hayden ordered Chief Spina to stay away from his wife and to surrender off-duty weapons.


In Haiti, Democracy Still Flounders
Last month's elections in Haiti were a messy affair.
The electoral commission president, Anselme Remy, was widely condemned for mismanagement and political insensitivity.
In some places people did not get to vote.
In others, ballot boxes were not secured.
A largely illiterate electorate was badly prepared to deal with needlessly complex ballots.
Even so, observers concluded that massive fraud, of the type that characterized elections in the Dominican Republic in 1994, did not occur.
Now a report from the Carter Center, which sent observers to the Haitian election, has raised legitimate concerns while drawing some conclusions that are unnecessarily alarmist.


Legacy of a dead newspaper: A bottom-line vocabulary.
IF Mark H. Willes did not exist, the newspaper industry would have invented him.
Two months ago, Mr.
Willes said he had read New York Newsday once in his life -- when he was being considered to run Times Mirror, the company that published the paper for 10 years and vowed to stick with it forever.
But Mr.
Willes did not hesitate to close the paper on July 16, during his sixth week as chief executive.
New York Newsday, he said, did not seem likely to earn an "appropriate rate of return."


Whither CBS?
If the Westinghouse Electric Corporation completes a bid for CBS Inc., the reaction inside CBS may be muted relief that the eight-year reign of Laurence A. Tisch as chairman will end.
But the only truly happy people may be at CBS's competitors, cheered that the new owner would be Westinghouse and not an entrepreneurial company with better prospects of reviving the network's sagging fortunes.
Executives from the competing networks and analysts said a CBS-Westinghouse combination would pose little threat of a quick comeback for the network.


Bosnian War Bewilders a Midwestern Town
Donna Stath was embarrassed.
"I try to follow the war in Bosnia, but it's so confusing," she said.
"It's been going on for 300 or 400 years. I know there are atrocities going on. I understand Serbs are raping Muslim women, and kidnapping their sons.
"I think it's sad," Mrs.
Stath, the secretary of the Merrillville Community School Board, went on.
"I think, 'Golly, is this a similar situation to Nazi Germany?' And everybody ignored that for how many years?"


Lure of Entanglements Home-Grown and Lasting
BEACH MUSIC  By Pat Conroy  Illustrated. 628 pages. Nan A. Talese/ Doubleday. $27.50.
The title of Pat Conroy's latest extravagant novel, "Beach Music," refers to the songs that Jack McCall and Shyla Fox danced to as high-school seniors in a falling-down house on the coast of South Carolina the night they fell in love.
Especially their favorite, "Save the Last Dance for Me," by the Drifters.


Pulse: Beach Closings
There were nearly 500 beach closings in the region last year, according to a report last month by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
Experts say New Jersey, Connecticut and New York are three of the best states for comprehensive monitoring of their beaches.
These three states, Indiana and Pennsylvania are the only ones that consistently close beaches every time water quality standards are violated.
Sewer and stormwater overflow, often caused by heavy rain, is the main source of coastal pollution in the region and the nation.
The cost of comprehensive beach monitoring is small when compared with the economic activity generated by coastal tourism.
New Jersey spent about $400,000 to monitor the entire Jersey Shore in 1994; in the same year, coastal tourism in the state generated approximately $12.1 billion.


With Heat's Toll Still Being Tallied, Chicagoans Line Up for the Grieving
A delivery truck pulled into the driveway of A. A. Rayner &amp; Sons here on Friday and unloaded another rush order: eight gleaming coffins.
The day before, the truck had dropped off 20 at Rayner's red brick building, a funeral home on Chicago's South Side in one of the areas hit hardest by the heat wave that claimed more than 450 lives here a week ago.


Clemens Slated for Tests For the Sinking Red Sox
Twins 8, Red Sox 3
Roger Clemens was rocked for eight runs in one and a third innings yesterday in the Minnesota Twins' 8-3 victory over the Red Sox at Fenway Park.
Clemens (3-3) gave up nine hits and walked two in tying the second-shortest start of his career.


In New Book, D'Amato Settles Some Old Scores
George Bush "had no political compass." Mario M. Cuomo was "obsessed with the need to win with a bigger margin than me." Elizabeth Holtzman "thought nothing of destroying people to get a headline." John S. Dyson "lacked any real gray matter."
Coming from any other sitting United States Senator, the response to putting such observations in writing might be, "Why?" But from Alfonse M. D'Amato, who has never made a secret of his opinions, a more likely question is "Why now?"


Those Lucky Few Youngsters Who Escape Tragic Streets
Tomorrow night, "Dateline" gives its full hour to a celebration of several young people who have beaten the odds against growing up safe and sane in their Brooklyn neighborhood.
It's a muted celebration.
Their achievement -- high school graduation, some college, a steady job -- would be taken for granted in most other American communities.
What makes it special is that they were raised in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, where a murder a week is the average.
The producers of "Class Photo" managed to track down 21 of the 25 young men and women, all black, who posed for the fourth-grade picture in the 1981-82 school year.
Len Cannon's interviews bring out the dangers and lures of their streets.
One young man tells of leaving school in the 11th grade to escape beatings from tougher kids, "It was either go to school and take the chance of being killed, or dropping out." Others tell simply of craving money to keep up with the neighborhood swaggerers.
One says that dealing drugs and mugging people "ain't the only way, but it's the fastest way."


It's the Same Old Song: Indurain Wins His Fifth Tour de France in a Row
For tens of thousands of Spaniards, the Champs-Elysees was the staging area for a fiesta today, and for the fifth successive year, the master of the revels was Miguel Indurain.
As his fans danced, sang, cheered, chanted and applauded, he cruised eight times up and down the broad avenue in the heart of Paris as the easy winner of the 82d Tour de France.


Dudley B. Bonsal Dies at 88; Was U.S. District Court Judge
Judge Dudley B. Bonsal, a senior United States district judge for the Southern District of New York and a former president of the New York City Bar Association, died on Saturday at his home in Bedford, N.Y.
He was 88.
Judge Bonsal (pronounced BON-sel) joined the bench in 1961, sitting in the courthouse at Foley Square in Manhattan.
He acquired senior status 15 years later and resigned from regular case duty when he was 85.


Corrections
The Sports of The Times column on Wednesday referred incorrectly to the history of African-American head coaches at Rutgers University.
Vivian Stringer, who was hired on July 14 as women's basketball coach, is not the first.
Sandra Petway coached women's track and field in the early 1980's, and Craig Littlepage coached men's basketball from 1985-86 to 1987-88.


No Headline
If I condone the bombing of the Serbs, or the arming of the Bosnians, am I not saying 'it's O.K.' to violence?
If nothing is done, am I not being passive to genocide?

It's painful. -- SAMMIE MALETTA, a Catholic priest in Merrillville, Ind.  [ A7:1. ]


Navy Certainly Needs Seawolf Submarine
To the Editor:
"The Pentagon Jackpot" (editorial, July 10) is inaccurate in its suggestion that the Navy does not want or need ships funded by the Senate Armed Services Committee.
The Navy, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President have all repeatedly said that the third Seawolf submarine, authorized by the committee, is an important, appropriate investment.

Build Fewer Prisons
To the Editor:
In a July 10 news article you quote Ted Deeds of the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, an advocate of "no-frills" jails, as saying: "If the leadership says they can't control the facility without televisions and weight-training rooms, then we really need to be asking ourselves why we are sending prisoners there."

A picture caption on Friday about children in Brooklyn looking at a grasshopper misstated the age of the youngest child, Julye Geller.

Veterans Home Plan Is Assailed
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of Hackensack, is taking aim at a plan by Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman to turn over the Paramus Veterans Home to private hands.
The Congressman said he would introduce legislation today that would bar Federal financing for state-run veterans' homes if privatization results in diminished services.
The Paramus home houses about 300 former armed services members and is one of three such homes operated by the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs.


Girl, 12, Is Groped At a Pool in Queens
The police arrested seven youths accused of sexually groping a 12-year-old girl after surrounding her in a city swimming pool in Astoria, Queens, on Saturday, officials said.
The arrests of the teen-agers stemmed from the summer's first reported incident at a city pool of "whirlpooling," in which boys surround a girl and try to remove her bathing suit and sexually accost her.


Heavenly Prize Rises, Fourstardave Fades
Fourstardave didn't get it done at Saratoga today, but Heavenly Prize did.
She gave one of the commanding performances of the year by racing spectacularly from next-to-last place to win the Go For Wand Stakes by 11 lengths over Forcing Bid.
This was the champion 3-year-old filly of last year in all her glory as the leading candidate for champion older filly of this year.


Corestates Drops Proposed Merger With Bank of Boston
Corestates Financial of Philadelphia and the Bank of Bostonannounced yesterday that they had called off a $4.2 billion merger.
It was the third time that a potential merger has fallen through for the Boston bank.
The banks said yesterday that they "were unable to agree on a plan that provides sufficient benefits to our shareholders, customers, employees and communities." They had intended to announce the merger this morning.


Girl Drowns At a Beach In Queens
A 17-year-old Brooklyn girl drowned off Rockaway Beach in Queens early yesterday while swimming with a woman and two men, a Police Department spokesman said.
The spokesman, Capt.
Rocco Romano of the 100th Precinct, said the police received a 911 call about 6 A.M., and after arriving on the beach just off Beach 97th Street, spotted a woman and two men in the water about 100 feet from shore.


C. W. Boldyreff, 85, University Professor Who Fought Soviets
Constantin W. Boldyreff, a Russian emigre who fought Communism as a youth in the Soviet Union and later as a college professor in the United States, died on Tuesday at the Tolstoy Center Nursing Home in Valley Cottage, N.Y.
He was 85.
The son of a general in the White Russian Army who was shot by the Communists in 1932, Mr.
Boldyreff fled to Yugoslavia, where he received an engineering degree, managed British-American mining operations, and, by his later account, joined other young Russian emigres in establishing N.T.S., the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, an underground anti-Communist organization.


1997 Festival Is Canceled
Facing growing costs and growing opportunities for athletes to compete elsewhere, the United States Olympic Committee has canceled the next scheduled Olympic Festival, which was to be held in 1997.
The 1999 festival is also uncertain.


:New Microsoft network will offer a wealth of privacy.
GIVEN the intense scrutiny by government, press and competitors over the last few months, it seems unthinkable that anything has been left unsaid about the Microsoft Network.
But in fact, very little has been made of the fact that MSN will be a global on-line service from the start -- Aug. 24, the day of the Windows 95 release.
And even less has been said about MSN's design, which Microsoft has said complies with the new data-privacy rules that the European Union is expected to adopt in September.
Two European Union members, France and Germany, already have adopted similar rules.


Uruguay Wins America Cup
Uruguay, looking to reassert itself after missing the 1994 World Cup, beat Brazil, 5-3, on penalty kicks today to win the America Cup.
After the teams played to a 1-1 tie in regulation, goalkeeper Fernando Alvez saved Brazil's third penalty kick by Tulio, enabling Uruguay to win a record 14th South American championship.
Brazil had not lost in 25 straight international games dating to 1993.


Editorial Notebook; Some Like It Cool
There are not a lot of places to ice skate in July, and hardly any outdoors.
But the Sun Valley resort in the mountains of southern Idaho has rinks outside and inside, and there you will find every summer a subspecies of New Yorkers who refuse to see skating as a cold-weather sport.
Their winter habitat is the little rink at Rockefeller Center in the canyons of Manhattan.
Come summer, they head to bigger ice in the wide-open spaces out West.
These are not the hordes of out-of-towners who crowd the Rockefeller rink at Christmastime to skate round and round under the tree.
These are a few dozen serious figure skaters who take to the ice in early morning all winter, before tourists are out of bed, to glide, to spin, to dance and, in the words of one veteran, "to perpetuate their illusions."


Reporter's Notebook; Defense Takes Detour To Soften Sheik's Image
Call it the sheik's softer side.
Or, as his lawyer put it, look at the accused terrorist as Dear Abby.
For six months, Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have been portraying Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a Muslim cleric, as a fundamentalist fanatic who led a terror-bombing conspiracy in New York that included the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, which killed six people, and aborted plots to blow up the United Nations and the Hudson River commuter tunnels.


Postcards With Quite An Edge
It's the rare summer when PBS doesn't whip up a travelogue series for armchair tourists.
This year's concoction, imported from Britain as usual, is "Clive James's Postcards." Mr.
James is what's known at the BBC, for lack of a more precise characterization, as a personality and critic.
He was last seen here as host of a series called "Fame in the 20th Century." He obviously loves to chat, wryly, and to do silly things like donning studded leather to dance the night away at a trendy club in New York, stopping to recall fondly the days when he "had hair and a waist."
These "postcards" from places like New York, Cairo and Berlin are really notes or jottings, random observations held together by Mr.
James's ego.
But they do have an uncanny way of capturing the essence of a place.
Looking as if he should be played by Sir Ralph Richardson, Mr.
James wanders about genially while sneering politely at the world about him.
In last week's trip to London, for instance, after trudging over to Buckingham Palace to watch the changing of the guard, he warned that "to get a good position, you have to stand on a child."


Lightning Strikes 5 as Storm, Swift and Fierce, Whirls In
A fierce storm swept across the New York region late yesterday, flooding highways and leaving five people injured by lightning in New Jersey.
In Long Island, several trees were uprooted by a suspected tornado.
The five struck by lightning were seeking refuge from the storm under a tree in Englewood when they were hit, officials said.
The five, including a young girl, were admitted to Englewood Hospital where they were being treated last night.


Robert Crandall, 80, Retired Editor, Dies
Robert S. Crandall, who was The New York Times's travel editor and held other editing positions at The Times from 1952 until he retired in 1979, died on July 6 at Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers, Fla.
He was 80 and lived in Cape Coral, Fla.
His family informed The Times of his death on Friday.
The cause was prostate cancer, said his brother, Philip.


Little Joy Left at the Fun House
Coney Island U.S.A., the oddest spectacle on the Coney Island Boardwalk, has entertained nearly a million people over the last 11 years with processions of bearded ladies, sword swallowers and snake charmers.

Peacekeepers at Fallen Enclave Confirm Some Atrocities but Say They Saw No Rapes
Dutch peacekeeping troops evacuated from Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia said today that Bosnian Serb invaders executed at least 10 Muslim defenders and abducted between 150 and 300 men between the ages of 16 and 60.
Since the fall of Srebrenica, refugees who were shipped to the town of Tuzla last week have drawn a grisly picture of Bosnian Serbs raping women and massacring untold hundreds of Muslim men between the ages of 16 and 60.


Fairness Denied in New York
Patrick Buchanan, the conservative commentator who is running for the Republican Presidential nomination, has been lecturing New Yorkers on the basic tenets of democracy.
Even those who cannot abide his views should give him a hearing.
Mr.
Buchanan speaks the truth when he says that the state's Presidential primary laws are indefensible and that the Republican Presidential primary scheduled for March 1996 "comes very close to being a political fix."
"Close" is an understatement.
The primary has been fixed, pure and simple -- courtesy of Senator Alfonse D'Amato's skillful manipulation of the state's complex voting laws to help his chosen candidate, Senator Bob Dole.
Among the state's top Republicans, only Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and State Senator Roy Goodman have protested what amounts to a hijacking of democracy.


George T. Douris, 67, Public Relations Executive
George T. Douris, a New York public relations executive whose clients benefited from his prominence in the city's Greek-American community and the extensive contacts he cultivated during his years as a newspaper reporter covering City Hall, died on Friday at the Roosevelt Hospital Division of St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.
He was 67 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.


Latest Taiwan Uproar Brings Back Old Hand
"I thought she was dead," said the old Flying Tiger veteran, devoted five-decades-strong to Mrs.

"But she is alive -- a great lady, a hell of a politician and a rousing speaker," exulted Myron D. Levy, 77, who was an enlisted man in one of the war's Flying Tiger units of American fighter planes that darted about like musketeers in defense of the Chinese, fiercely inspired by the doughty Mrs.
Chiang.


Now the British Want to Change the Rules on Irish Peace Talks

No peace process based on inequality can work.
Sinn Fein has a democratic mandate which the British Government must respect.

GARY LeMEL has been president of music for Warner Brothers studios for nine years and has been responsible for the soundtracks of dozens of movies, ranging from the Batman films to "The Big Chill" to "The Bridges of Madison County."

Universities Start to Invest In Riskier Markets  Facing bigger student financial-aid needs and shrinking government support, a growing number of top universities are pulling endowment money from conservative investments like blue-chip stocks and bonds and putting it into much riskier, high-flying corners of the financial markets: venture capital, leveraged buyouts, hedge funds and emerging markets like Poland and Mexico.

Sinn Fein Leader Says He Met In Secret With British Official
Gerry Adams, the political leader of the Irish Republican Army, said today that he had a secret meeting last week with the chief British official in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, to try to break the impasse in the Northern Ireland peace effort.
Mr.
Adams said the meeting, which was confirmed by British officials, "shows their sense of urgency" in trying to reach peace, but he declined to disclose specifics of the discussion.
Both he and a senior British official, Michael Ancram, said there would probably be further top-level talks.

Relief for Now at Times Mirror Unit
A sigh of relief spread through Times Mirror Magazines last week with the announcement that the parent company's drastic cost-cutting program would not include selling the magazine division.
The Times Mirror Company closed New York Newsday on July 16 as part of a plan to cut 1,750 jobs at its newspapers, including 150 at The Los Angeles Times.
But it is unclear if the magazines have really been spared or if Mark H. Willes, Times Mirror's new chief executive, will eventually decide to sell them as a group or individually.


Patents; The man who gave the world vinyl wins a place in the Inventors Hall of Fame.
IN 1928, Waldo Lonsbury Semon concocted a substance that would alter the texture and smell of everyday life.
Technically that substance is called polyvinyl chloride, but most people refer to it simply as vinyl.
Vinyl has been used to make phonograph records, go-go boots, irrigation pipes, raincoats, garden hoses, tents, siding for houses, garment bags, floor tiles, dresses, bumper stickers and umbrellas.
Vinyl used in the interiors of automobiles is what gives new cars that new-car smell.
Today, some 67 years after it was invented, vinyl is the second-most-used plastic, after polyethelene, which is used widely for packaging.
Worldwide, vinyl constitutes a $20-billion-a-year industry; 44 billion pounds are produced each year.


Japanese Schools Are Different, Not Better; Conformity in U.S. Too
To the Editor:

In many ways the Japanese schools in the town of Omiya do present a striking contrast to American public schools.
In many other ways, the two are much the same.


A Backhoe for a Bank Job
Three men hot-wired a backhoe yesterday and tried to steal the night deposit box from a Chemical Bank branch in midtown Manhattan, the police said.
The failed robbery began around 5 P.M. when the three apparently used a screwdriver to start a backhoe that was idle at a construction site close to the bank, on Park Avenue South near East 23d Street.
Maneuvering the vehicle's claw, they smashed through a window and were about to scoop out the night deposit box when police sirens scared them away, witnesses told the police.


Fans' Fingers Crossed for Mattingly
The fans who had been expected to come to Yankee Stadium yesterday to bury pitcher Jack McDowell instead chose to praise first baseman Don Mattingly in an emotional show of support for the embattled team captain.
The 32,675 fans put on an impressive display of spontaneous combustion after a Mattingly home run helped insure what would become an 11-4 victory over the Texas Rangers.


To Compete, Hospitals Get Hoteliers' Service Lessons
While patients should probably not expect 24-hour room service, plush terry robes and a little Swiss chocolate on their pillows, hospitals in New York City, faced with the realities of a competitive marketplace, have now turned for advice to hoteliers, management consultants and other experts in the previously alien world of customer service.
At New York Hospital not long ago, Isadore Sharp, the chairman and president of the Four Seasons Hotels and a certified specialist in the comfort arts, lectured specialists in the healing arts: surgeons and nurses, bureaucrats and executives.

The hundreds of thousands of young (and mostly female) factory workers in Central America who earn next to nothing and often live in squalor have been an absolute boon to American clothing company executives like Donald G. Fisher, the chief executive of the Gap and Banana Republic empire, who lives in splendor and paid himself more than $2 million last year.
Judith Viera is an 18-year-old who worked at a maquiladora plant in El Salvador that made clothing for the Gap and other companies.
She was paid a pathetic 56 cents an hour.
If she wanted to use the bathroom, she had to go through the humiliation of asking a supervisor for a ticket.
Anyone who stayed in the bathroom too long was punished by being sent outside to sweep the grounds in the hot sun.


Taking In the Sites; From the Detroit Picket Line to On Line
Labor disputes, which for many years played out on picket lines and in smoke-filled rooms, are moving onto the World Wide Web.
The Woodie Guthries of today write hypertext documents, not ballads, and the Henry Fords can take their cases to a nationwide audience within minutes of a walkout.
The response to a strike by six unions against Detroit's two largest newspapers, The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press, and their operating company, the Detroit Newspaper Agency, makes it appear as if management, more than the unions, set up an electronic picket line.


Western Generals Personally Warn Serb Commander
The United States, Britain and France sent three generals to Belgrade today to warn the Bosnian Serbs' military leader personally that an assault on the Gorazde enclave would result in allied air attacks "at unprecendented levels," the White House said.
In a 90-minute meeting with the Bosnian Serb commander, Gen.
Ratko Mladic, the generals also demanded an end to attacks on all other enclaves designated as safe areas by the United Nations, the White House said in a written statement.
The statement said General Mladic also was told that the allies and the United Nations would take "any steps which may become necessary" to resupply United Nations troops in Bosnia.


Eclectic Monet, Bathed in Chicago's Ballyhoo
It is hard to believe that the Claude Monet exhibition just opened at the Art Institute of Chicago is the first major overview of his paintings to be organized in the United States in a generation.
It seems as if every third-rate Impressionist, never mind Monet, has had a show already.
The public's infatuation with the movement has been matched only by the eagerness of museums to capitalize on it.
And why not?
People love the works, Monet's above all, even if they can be glimpsed only through a mass of milling backs at blockbuster shows, like this one, which have turned the phrase "crowd control" from police argot into a matter of museum policy.
The Art Institute promises that, in compliance with fire codes, only 800 visitors an hour will be allowed into the galleries.
What a relief.


Credibility Problem Undermining Allies
The Western allies have issued their strongest ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs in three years, but the way the ultimatum was agreed upon highlighted the differences among the nations laying it down.
The statements of delegations among the 16 countries involved contain caveats and ambiguities that detracted from the fact that Britain and France had agreed to Washington's plan for large-scale retaliation against the Bosnian Serbs.


First Lady Takes a Page From Eleanor Roosevelt
The first First Lady to become a major media figure was Eleanor Roosevelt, whose syndicated column, "My Day" began in 1936 and continued, in one form or another, for more than two decades, at its peak reaching hundreds of newspapers and making news with Mrs.
Roosevelt's stands on major issues like civil rights and labor relations.
Mrs.
Roosevelt filed the column six days a week from all over the world, lugging a typewriter on her tour of South Pacific bases in 1943 and even composing aboard a destroyer.
When Franklin D. Roosevelt once complained about Washington columnists, a reporter reminded him that his wife was one, but he replied, "She simply writes a daily diary."


The Man Behind Giuliani's Relations With the Unions
IT'S likely that Randy L. Levine won't be able to do everything he says he will do.
He may not reinvent labor relations in New York City or transform the tradition-bound Board of Education or cut the work force without hurting city services or make municipal employees more productive, and happier in the bargain.
But talk to the Commissioner of Labor Relations, an enthusiastic, voluble personality in a government of little-known, media-shy administrators, and you believe he will deliver on every last item on his list.
Or at least that he believes he will, and is well on the way.


Affirmative Action's End? Now, It's Not That Simple
Three days after the University of California Board of Regents ostensibly did away with all campus affirmative action programs based on race or sex, the intended goal of that mandate was threatened on two fronts: the loss of Federal largess and perceived loopholes in the order itself.
This morning, President Clinton's chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, said that the University of California made a "terrible mistake" on Thursday in its affirmative action vote, and he said that the Justice Department would begin a review of the billions of Federal dollars that flow to the state's universities.

Ambiguous Ultimatum: Allies Show Differences
The paradox of the conference on Bosnia held in London on Friday is this: it resulted in the Western allies' strongest ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs in three years, but the way the ultimatum was agreed upon showed the differences and even confusion among the nations laying it down.
The danger now, diplomats here say, is that the Bosnian Serbs will read the differences as disunity and lack of resolve and so press ahead with their military campaign to take Bosnian enclaves ostensibly protected by the United Nations.

Drivers Find Privatized License Offices Fumbling
Two weeks into the privatization of 23 field offices, the New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles is still struggling with a bruised image and unhappy customers.
Wrinkles persist in what Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman had promoted as a wrinkle-free step to reduce staffing levels, increase efficiency and save taxpayers $3.8 million.
The Governor ordered the privatization of the field offices of the Motor Vehicles Division in January, giving her aides seven months to plan for the change.
But in the end, the private agencies opened July 10 with patched-together staffs, including 141 workers recruited from 10 temporary-employment agencies and put to work after only a weekend of training.
Half the temporary workers were still working today, suggesting that staffing problems remain.
Under the plan, 334 unionized employees will be replaced with nonunion workers, who will get lower pay and fewer benefits.
Independent agents will run the 23 offices.


Tri Valley Growers Picks Miller Meester
Tri Valley Growers in San Francisco, a cooperative owned by more than 650 California fruit and vegetable growers, has named Miller Meester Advertising in Minneapolis to handle advertising, direct marketing and new-brand assignments for products sold under labels including S &amp; W and Red Pack.
Though the billings were not disclosed, the total marketing budget last year was more than $50 million.


For Rocca, Nice Guy Finishes 2d In Britain
He sort of shambled up through the crowd, his cap pulled low and his shoulders slumping slightly.
Costantino Rocca was headed for the far side of the Royal and Ancient clubhouse, to a television interview area where a beaming John Daly was talking to the BBC, and as Rocca walked people were reaching out and patting him on the back.
He is golf's Everyman.
And this amiable golfer from Italy nearly pulled off every man's dream today when he got into a playoff for the British Open title.
He lost, but the improbable route he traveled to get there was a parallel to his unlikely road into professional golf.
Still, at this moment, he was disappointed and it showed on his expressive face.

The cause was a heart attack, said Michael Thoele, a family friend.
Mr.

Donations Up in '94 For Public Service
The amount of time and space donated to public service campaigns produced by the Advertising Council rose sharply last year from 1993.
The council, which coordinates the advertising industry's public-service efforts, said on Friday that the media donated $891.6 million in commercial time and ad space in 1994, up 45.7 percent from $612 million in the previous year.
Ruth Wooden, president, attributed the gains to factors that included the creation of materials for new venues like Yellow Pages directories and offering the media a wider variety of campaign materials.

13 Technical Mistakes in Apollo 13
Some people just cannot help themselves; they have to find fault.
You know the type.
They watch the movie "Quiz Show" and notice that the numbers on Herb Stempel's house in Queens don't match the address shown on a piece of paper.
In thrillers, they count the shots fired and sneer that in real life the hero would be out of ammo.
They can tell you if an actor was wearing a blue shirt when he entered the bar and a white shirt when he left.
And when the movie is a techno-wonder like Universal Pictures "Apollo 13," some engineers just can't help themselves.
They look for errors and anomalies - and they find them.
The movie in question tells the true story of the Apollo 13 astronauts - Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) - and their ill-starred trip to the moon in April of 1970.


A Britten Curiosity Is Rescued
Benjamin Britten's "Paul Bunyan," his first operatic work and his only collaboration with the poet W. H. Auden, is a theatrical mongrel.
Written mostly during 1939-40, when Britten was living in the New York area, the opera was intended to be a pragmatic theater piece suitable for performance by high-school students.
The resulting work has elements of opera with extended choral ensembles, much spoken dialogue, parody, Kurt Weill-like cabaret and even a rather incongruous guitar-strumming balladeer who acts as a narrator.
It was received with poor reviews at Columbia University in 1941, and Britten soon withdrew it.
But in 1974 he revised it.
And it's this version that the prestigious Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., has revived in a handsome, vibrant and creative production that makes a strong case for this virtually unknown work.


White House Says Hearings By G.O.P. Hurt Budget
Continuing an Administration campaign to portray Republicans as the party of gridlock, Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said today that the Government could face a "train wreck" on the budget in October because Republicans were spending time holding hearings on issues like the Waco raid and Whitewater.
Many Republicans criticized Democratic gridlock in Congress during successful Congressional campaigns last year.
With President Clinton threatening to veto Republican budget initiatives in the coming months, the Administration is making an early effort to deflect any possible blame.


Taiwan Reports Nearby Firing Of 4 Test Missiles by China
The Taiwan military authorities said today that China had fired four test missiles off its southern coast on Friday and Saturday, about 85 miles north of Taiwan.
The missile tests, announced last week by the Chinese Army, appear to be one of several steps taken by China to highlight its displeasure with recent efforts by Taiwan to gain international recognition.

Her hands are more valuable wielding a scalpel than an aluminum bat, orthopedics being a higher calling and more financially rewarding than softball.
But Dot Richardson's sport is coming to the Summer Olympics for the first time, and her medical career, like elective surgery, can wait.
The most dominant Americans in Atlanta next summer may not be basketball's Dream Team, but rather the women's national softball squad.
The United States has not lost a game since 1986 while rolling up 105 consecutive victories and three world championships on its international odometer, ruling softball the way Cuba rules amateur baseball.


Place Called Home for Cyber-Families of Future
Never mind the all-electric kitchen and the two-car garage.
Today, the American dream house has fiber optic wiring and a two-port outlet in every room.
For about $465,000 you, too, can own the Information Highway House, complete with a high-speed data communications network that will allow you to have a computer in nearly every room.
A model of this home (3BR + office, LR, FDR, EIK, 2,500 sq. ft. liv space) is being shown in Corte Madera, Calif., 10 miles north of San Francisco in Marin County.
The model home is part of a 150-house complex, called Madera del Presidio, that is being built by HCV Pacific Partners, a developer based in San Francisco.


Tai Journal; At an African Border, Hospitality Comes to Grief
In recent years, outsiders who strayed through this tiny border town, with its thousands of refugees from the civil war in Liberia, often remarked that Tai hardly seemed to be a part of this country.
While the street signs were in French, Liberian English was more commonly heard, and debates tended to be about the lawless land to the west rather than over the Ivory Coast's own staid politics.

Bridge
In the semifinal stage of the Von Zedtwitz Double Knockout Team Championship, which attracts most of the top-ranked players in the New York metropolitan area, the survivors are teams captained by Lapt Chan, Dorothy Truscott, Robb Gordon and Robin Kay.
The Chan team, unbeaten and therefore favored to win the title, will play Kay's team, while Truscott opposes Gordon.
In one recent quarterfinal match, the diagramed deal played a key role.
North and South for the Truscott team were Carol Simon of Summit, N.J., and John Lowenthal of Manhattan, who were overambitious in the auction and reached a precarious five-heart contract.
South's eventual four-spade bid was "kickback," a Blackwood substitute, and he put on the brakes when he discovered the partnership was missing either two aces or one ace and the heart king.

Japanese Schools Are Different, Not Better
To the Editor:
"Japan's Schools: Safe, Clean, Not Much Fun" (front page, July 18) compares Japanese and American students on topics ranging from international math exam scores to suicide rates.
Japan is an island-nation whose populace is racially, religiously and economically homogeneous, and whose boundaries are protected from drugs and weapons smuggling because of its isolated location.


On a California Campus, Diversity Goals Go Unchanged
An acrylic sculpture in front of the law school here seems an apt metaphor for the University of California regents' debate over affirmative action this week.
The sculpture, by the late artist Robert Arneson, consists of two giant egg heads, their mouths open, apparently in angry argument.
Conspicuously, they have no ears.
Last week, when the Board of Regents voted to strike down the university system's race- and gender-based affirmative action policies, they were not listening to the defenders of those programs: the president who oversees the system, the nine chancellors who run the system's universities, the faculty senate or a wide variety of student organizations.


U.N. COMBAT FORCE SENT TO SARAJEVO TO COUNTER SERBS
More than 800 British and French troops, equipped with heavy artillery batteries, moved toward this besieged capital today to mount an aggressive campaign against Bosnian Serb gunners in one of the riskiest moves yet taken here by the United Nations.
The troops are to secure a supply route into the city and respond to rebels who are shelling and blasting Sarajevo with deadly intensity.


Tanqueray pulls out the stops for bike events to benefit AIDS patients, and Mr. Jenkins rides along.
IF Mr.
Jenkins, the imaginary sybarite who peddles Tanqueray gin, were to support a cause, it would probably be the Second Yacht for Mr.
Jenkins Foundation.
So it's surprising to see the character featured in an extensive advertising and promotional program devoted to the brand's sponsorship of a series of bicycle rides that benefit organizations helping AIDS patients.
Indeed, the program, which extends from magazines and telephone kiosks to bars and the Internet, is itself surprising in that the Schieffelin &amp; Somerset Company, the unit of Guinness P.L.C. that imports Tanqueray, is devoting 15 to 20 percent of the brand's total annual American marketing communications budget of $27 million to the AIDS rides program.
The rides, which began last year in California, are being expanded to the East Coast in September and are scheduled to spread to the Midwest and the South in 1996.


Amid Old Brooklyn Factories, A Shrinking Canvas
In the last 15 years, artists by the hundreds have advanced on a desolate warren of empty factory buildings and cobblestone streets in Brooklyn known as Dumbo, for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass.
As traffic rumbled overhead, the artists propped up their canvases and put up curtains in sooty Civil War-era buildings abandoned by manufacturers.
They began a Friday pizza night as babies were born.
They did their laundry by hiring a car service to take them to gentrified Brooklyn Heights next-door.
They became patrons of a local espresso bar that serves freshly baked biscotti and cappuccino with extra foam.
They felt blessed to be in a quiet old factory district much like SoHo before it became SoHo.


The First Lady's Newest Role: Newspaper Columnist
One of the most scrutinized women in America made her debut in a new role today, musing lightly as a weekly syndicated columnist in more than 100 newspapers and magazines worldwide about the pleasures of driving her own car or of being mistaken for a mere look-alike of her well-known self.
But even as Hillary Rodham Clinton embarked on her latest effort to explain herself as something other than someone else's cardboard conception, she found herself back in another spotlight as well: in front-page headlines as the uncalled witness and unspoken target of the latest round of Congressional investigations into the lingering soap opera of Whitewater.


Universities Taking On Risks To Overcome Fiscal Squeeze
Facing bigger student financial-aid needs and shrinking government support, a growing number of top universities are pulling endowment money out of stodgy investments like blue-chip stocks and bonds and putting it into much riskier, high-flying corners of the financial markets: venture capital, leveraged buyouts, hedge funds and emerging markets like Poland and Mexico.
Yale University, which pioneered the approach and has embraced it most aggressively, now puts roughly 60 percent of its portfolio into less-conventional -- and generally riskier -- investments.
Duke assigns half its endowment to such investments, and Brown and Notre Dame a third each.


Essay; Vincent Foster's 'Can of Worms'

Woman Stabbed to Death In Upper East Side Home
Before the Rollerbladers awaken, before the bistro brunch dates, Sunday morning on the Upper East Side is as quiet as Manhattan gets.
But yesterday, just after 9 A.M., the Sunday silence was broken by terrified screams as a woman was stabbed to death in her apartment at 1729 First Avenue, just two blocks from the Mayor's residence.
The victim, whose name was withheld pending notification of relatives but described by the police as 45 to 55 years old, lived alone in a fourth-floor studio.
She had just returned home from buying a newspaper and groceries when a man pushed his way into her apartment and attacked her with a knife or other sharp object, the police said.


Congressional Memo; Packwood Complaints Have a Nervous Senate Hearing Echoes of Anita Hill
For more than two years, the Senate has done its best to keep Bob Packwood's troubles on the back burner.
But this week, they could be forced front and center, pushing the Senate into the last thing it wants: a replay of the Anita Hill disaster.
Senator Packwood is the Oregon Republican who is alleged to have made unwanted sexual advances to women.
There were other accusations of official misconduct against the Senator, including tampering with evidence, but they never caught the public imagination in quite the same way.


A Surprise Film Hit About Rich Teen-Age Girls
In the midst of a summer of mostly desultory films, along came "Clueless." The wickedly funny farce about rich teen-age girls in Beverly Hills emerged this weekend as a sleeper hit of the summer.

"I just wanted to do something about the teen-age experience; it's such a wonderful and horrible time of life."


FIRST LADY TO GET PANEL'S SCRUTINY
A Senate committee investigating the Whitewater affair is expected to begin to examine this week whether Hillary Rodham Clinton played any role in the handling of papers in the office of the deputy White House counsel, Vincent W. Foster Jr., after he committed suicide two years ago.
Entering its second week of hearings, the committee is preparing to question some of the closest aides to the President and Mrs.
Clinton about whether she had told officials to remove papers from Mr.
Foster's office before any investigators got there.
The committee will also ask witnesses whether Mrs.
Clinton participated in the decision to prevent Federal investigators from looking at sensitive papers in the office.

Sports of The Times; Good Show Makes It An Expletive Deleted
THE Great Digital Dis Flap turned limp on Jack McDowell's first pitch against the Texas Rangers yesterday afternoon.

McDowell's first pitch, a called strike on Otis Nixon, drew cheers from the fans in Yankee Stadium.
They cheered when Nixon grounded out to second base.
They cheered when Will Clark struck out to end the inning, and when McDowell, with three up and three down, departed the mound and strode to the dugout, the fans cheered, some standing.


Israel-P.L.O. Talks Grind On Despite Deadlines

Dispute Could Send Strawberry Elsewhere
Darryl Strawberry never even got to don a Yankees uniform before finding himself in a full-fledged brawl with George Steinbrenner over his $850,000 contract, a fight that may have doomed the odd couple's short-lived relationship.
The dispute, simmering for days, erupted to such an extent last evening that Bill Goodstein, Strawberry's attorney, now plans to file a grievance against the Yankees with the Players Association today.


Just a Few Distractions In the Giants' Mixture
In most ways, the Giants come into training camp in great shape.
Most of their draft picks are signed.
They pretty much know which players are going to be where, something that was more uncertain last year.
And they have a great coach who seems more hungry than ever.
But there are some minor contractual problems with some key players that could become an annoyance.

Overtime Costs Eat Up Sanitation Savings
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani touts it as a major success in his effort to make New York City's unionized workers more productive: the contract he negotiated last year to force sanitation workers to pick up more trash.
And indeed, nine months later, workers are on average collecting 20 percent more garbage a day than before.
There's just one problem: The city has not saved much money.


Horror and Despair in the Balkans
From the takeover of Srebrenica to the assault on Zepa, television anchors and correspondents, by now masters of Serbo-Croat consonants, have been shelling the safe havens of America's living rooms with images of Serb aggression, Muslim despair and Western waffling.
Night after night has brought fierce contrasts from the ferocious war:
*Frightened, exhausted women and children, the sweepings of ethnic cleansing, set against polished emissaries exchanging phrases in the polished chambers of the United Nations.


Vernon I. Cheadle, 85, Botanist And U. of California Chancellor
Vernon I. Cheadle, a former Chancellor of the University of California at Santa Barbara whose 15-year tenure was marked by rapid campus growth as well as student unrest, died on Sunday at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara.
He was 85.
Dr.
Cheadle, who lived in Santa Barbara, was an internationally known botanist.
He was Chancellor from 1962 to 1977.
In that time, the number of disciplines taught on the campus rose to 100 from 36, master's programs to 42 from 15, and Ph.D. programs to 27 from 2.
Enrollment grew to more than 12,000 from 4,700.

How Many Species Are Being Lost? Scientists Try New Yardstick
FEW if any conservation biologists doubt that humans are driving other living species to extinction at a growing rate, and in recent years estimates of the magnitude of the apparent extinction crisis have flooded forth: A million species gone by the year 2000.
A quarter of all species by 2015.
Twenty-seven thousand species a year.
Three every hour.
The list goes on.
These global estimates have always been crude at best, heavy on theory but lighter on data, and have stimulated controversy.
Many scientists, while still convinced that humans are precipitating extinctions on an epic scale, now say it is futile to try to estimate future extinctions with any exactitude.


Unusual Slaying Spotlights Mystery of an Unusual Life
Everyone -- the cobbler, the grocer, the butcher, the neighbors upstairs and downstairs -- was familiar with the 49-year-old woman who was stabbed to death on Sunday inside her studio apartment on the Upper East Side, but no one knew a thing about her.
Even the police, whose job it is to piece together motives and personal histories, are struggling to learn something about the woman, Sherry Hollis Gini, and why she was killed.
So far, no relatives or friends have come forward.
Detectives, who are still looking for a suspect, said they had been able to find out little about Ms.
Gini, other than that she had paid for her apartment in cash and probably did not have a job.


Working With a Girl's Best Friend
"Dealers Among Dealers" is not the first television documentary about the diamond trade, but it is, guaranteed, the cheeriest.
Gem cutters in blue smocks and yarmulkes sing a Hebrew song while they work: Sholom Aleichem meets Walt Disney.
Traders trade quips along with million-dollar gems ("Buy me even if you can't afford me," says a seller speaking for his merchandise) and part amicably even when they can't come to terms.
At fashion shows, jewels glitter from decolletages; auctions, with bids rising in $100,000 increments, seem like funny-money games.
Even the dealer who has been driven by bad luck or times or judgment to drive the limousine he once hired is ready to try again.
Maybe it's the camera that brings out the smiles, but even if you have trouble believing that high spirits prevail so consistently in such a high-risk line, you may find your own spirits lifted by the program's pace and zest.
Gaylen Ross, the producer, catches the communitylike flavor of the business.
Everybody knows everybody: first names are the rule, and deals are made with a handshake.
Sons with nicely coiffed hair follow bearded fathers into the game; competitors study together in synagogue and dance together at weddings, men here, women over there.

The witness, Dr.

Strawberry Talks Are Moving Ahead Amid Some Snags
One of George Steinbrenner's proposals for Darryl Strawberry's contract would have subjected Strawberry's children to drug tests as beneficiaries of a trust created with his Yankee salary.
Another proposal Steinbrenner made after their original agreement would have given the club the right to release Strawberry if he violated a deal the owner wanted him to make with the Internal Revenue Service.
Strawberry's agent rejected those proposals and others, people familiar with the dispute said yesterday, and that's why Strawberry didn't join the Yankees, as scheduled, on Sunday.
But talks between the two sides yesterday led several people to say they were closing in on an agreement, and one person said he expected Strawberry to join the team later this week.

But how you take your espresso has become secondary to Mr.
Girotto, the chief executive of Luigi Lavazza S.p.A., Italy's biggest coffee company, and these days he shudders all the way to the bank.
Lavazza, which controls 43 percent of Italy's coffee market, is cashing in on America's flirtation with Italian foods, and above all its craze for exotic new coffees.

A Return to Barneys
Isaac Mizrahi is back in Barneys New York but will no longer sell to Bloomingdale's, where his shop has already been eliminated.
Jennifer Peck Barnett, the president of Isaac Mizrahi, said there was no connection between the two stores' situations.
But rivalry among retailers typically plays a part in such decisions.
Two years ago, when Barneys opened on Madison Avenue at 61st Street, several designers, including Mr.
Mizrahi, balked at selling there because of loyalty to (and pressure from) longtime players in the neighborhood like Saks, Bergdorf Goodman, Charivari and Bloomingdale's.
Mr.
Mizrahi's collection was dropped from the downtown Barneys when he refused to sell it uptown.

The head of the carpenters union in the New York City area, whose administration was under fire on charges of corruption, nepotism and favoritism to mobsters, appears to have been re-elected, according to an unofficial vote count completed last night.
A major issue in the campaign was the disclosures that aides to Frederick W. Devine, who was re-elected to a second term, had doled out lucrative jobs at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to mobsters and former convicts.

There was a time, and it wasn't very long ago, that Daly would have shown up an hour late, issued a few sullen, perfunctory remarks, and left.

Clinton Attacks the G.O.P. On Priorities in Budget Plan
Vowing strong opposition to a Congressional budget plan, President Clinton today accused Republicans of abandoning necessary Government programs for the "luxuries" of carrying out large tax cuts and balancing the budget in seven years.
In a speech that aides said was the beginning of a period of concerted lobbying on the budget, Mr.
Clinton came close to issuing a blanket veto threat if Republicans failed to heed his own spending priorities in areas like education, Medicare and environmental protection.
He said such programs were the "common ground" -- a phrase echoing more frequently in the President's oratory -- and had long had bipartisan support.


Connecticut Upholds Ban On Weapons
The Connecticut Supreme Court today upheld a state law banning assault weapons, declaring that the State Constitution's guarantee of the right to bear arms "does not guarantee the right to possess any weapon of the individual's choosing."
The decision, upholding a 1993 law that banned 67 semiautomatic assault weapons by brand name, makes Connecticut the first state with the right of self-defense specified in its Constitution to have an assault-weapons ban pass legal challenge, said Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who represented the state in the case.

Euro Disney's revenue is expected to be higher because of improved attendance prompted by a cut in entry fees of as much as 20 percent and the opening of the new Space Mountain ride on June 1.
Analysts also cited a financial revamping that has reduced interest payments on debt.

On Nazis, Truth and Treachery, With Songs
The Nazi imprisonment of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German theologian and pastor, and his execution only weeks before the Third Reich collapsed, is a peculiarly dramatic episode.
The eloquent Bonhoeffer was a complex man, and the confrontation between him and the Nazis brings into sharp focus the agony of an individual conscience facing evil as national destiny.
In "Bonhoeffer 1945," the playwright D. Paul Thomas, an actor who also takes the title role, uses a series of interrogations by a judge advocate (Nicholas Hormann) to explore some of the spiritual suffering Bonhoeffer wrote about in prison.
But as directed by Albert Sinkys at the Second Stage Theater (2162 Broadway, at 76th Street), the play is overloaded with symbolism and acting gimmicks, at times seeming like "Thomas 1995."

Talking Peace in Ireland
Peace is looking a bit less shaky in Northern Ireland.
According to news accounts that have not been officially confirmed, the British and Irish Governments have outlined a plan to break the impasse that has stopped the peace process from going to its next natural stage.
That stage would be all-party talks to end the civil conflict.
For the first time, it seems that the critical issue of disarming the Irish Republican Army might be resolved.
Until now, the British and the Protestant Unionists have refused to sit down with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the I.R.A., until the I.R.A. abandons its weapons.
The British and the Unionists, who wish to preserve British rule, insist the arms issue is all that stands in the way of peace talks.
Sinn Fein has maintained that decommissioning its weapons amounts to surrender.
The Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams points out that the I.R.A. has voluntarily observed a cease-fire for 11 months and that this should be evidence aplenty of its good will.

Allies Search For the 'Key' In Bomb Plan
Three days after the United States, Britain and France threatened Bosnian Serbs with heavy air strikes if they attacked the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, the NATO allies still have not decided who would be authorized to start the bombing.
Allied military commanders worked into the evening on plans to deter a full-scale Bosnian Serb assault on Gorazde, a senior NATO official said.
But although NATO representatives expressed "grave concern" today about the fighting in the western Bosnian enclave of Bihac, they delayed consideration of the military plan until Tuesday.

Films Born of Rage on France's Periphery
For all too long, French movies have been eating, drinking and chatting their way through a safe-and-tested menu of love triangles, wacky comedies, literary adaptations and historical dramas.
The problem was that, for many filmgoers, the bucolic, romantic and intellectual France of the screen was no longer recognizable.
Now several young film makers have decided to offer their vision of a more troubled, perhaps more real, France.
They have taken images long familiar to television viewers -- of unemployment, drug trafficking, vandalism and occasional race riots -- and breathed a new dimension into them.

By Design; Hiding, but So Stylishly
The first hint of mod hit the streets this summer: wraparound sunglasses.
They have the properly cool attitude, especially when the lenses are black and rectangular or oval.
And if the sun goes behind a cloud, wraparounds can function as quite efficient headbands, worn in the currently correct mod way: right at the hairline rather than on top of the head.
Saks Fifth Avenue has a good selection of them that includes Thierry Mugler's quintessentially mod white frames with black lenses ($210), Giorgio Armani's lightweight thin frames in tortoise shell ($200), Gianni Versace's all-black glasses with a bold gold emblem for the status-conscious ($195) and Charles Jourdan's all-black version with quilted side bars ($85).

International Briefs; Net Up 13% at Siemens
Siemens A.G., the German electronics and engineering giant, said its net profit rose 13 percent, to 4.405 billion marks ($3.18 billion), in the first nine months of the business year.
The chairman of Siemens, Heinrich von Pierer, repeated his forecast that group profit for the year ending Sept. 30 would rise 20 percent, to 2 billion marks ($1.45 billion).
The company posted a net of about 2 billion marks in the previous fiscal year, but the total included an extraordinary gain from the sale of its pacemaker unit. (Reuters)


Suicide Bomber Kills 5 in a Bus Attack Near Tel Aviv
A lull of three months in large-scale terrorism against Israelis was shattered today when a Palestinian suicide bomber set off a crude pipe bomb in a bus creeping through the morning rush hour here in a suburb of Tel Aviv, killing himself and at least 5 passengers and wounding 32 more.
Three of the wounded were in critical condition.
The attack came on the day before Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were to have reached an agreement on extending Palestinian self-rule to much of the West Bank.
While it was already evident before the blast that the deadline would not be met, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin vowed that the attack would not deter the talks.


Percy Humphrey, Jazz Trumpeter, 90
Percy Humphrey, a trumpeter best known for his work with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, died on Saturday in New Orleans, where he lived.
He was 90.
Mr.
Humphrey was from a musical family in New Orleans -- his grandfather, Jim Humphrey, taught many of the first-generation jazz musicians -- and grew up playing in all sorts of situations, from dance halls to brass bands.
He started out as a drummer, then changed to trumpet, working his way up to the position of first trumpet in the Eureka Brass Band, one of the city's most important.
In the 1950's he took over as leader of the group.


Prodigy Seeks to Reargue Its Defense in Libel Lawsuit
The Prodigy Services Company said yesterday it would seek to reargue a lawsuit filed by a Long Island brokerage firm that contends it had been libeled by comments distributed by the on-line service.
Prodigy, which is based in White Plains and is owned by I.B.M. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, said it had filed a motion to reargue its case before Justice Stuart L. Ain of the State Supreme Court in Mineola, L.I.
Prodigy's motion contends that its previous legal counsel failed to present an adequate defense against the charges by the brokerage firm, Stratton Oakmont Inc.
The firm is seeking $200 million in damages.

Despite Anti-Labor Oratory, Mayor Treats Unions Gently
When Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani strode into City Hall last year demanding vast concessions from municipal workers, many union chiefs saw it as a declaration of war.
"He can't operate this way," thundered Stanley Hill, who runs the city's largest union.
"We won't allow it."
Nineteen months later, the furious rhetoric has given way to a remarkable period of labor peace in New York City.
But that tranquillity has come at a price: few of the wholesale concessions and productivity gains the Mayor had promised have been achieved.
The Mayor's labor accomplishments appear to fall short of those in other cities -- and of his own campaign pledges.

How Can You Connect Singapore and Packwood's Accusers?; Mere Allegations
To the Editor:
It is sickening to read William Safire's continual diatribes on Singapore and its regime ("Singapore's Fear," July 20).
A repressive regime does not follow the ability-to-pay/ progressive system of taxation as much as Singapore does: income tax rates increase gradually from 3.5 percent for the lowest income group to 33 percent for the highest.
It has hardly any pockets of destitution, its infant mortality is among the lowest in the world (6 per 1,000 live births) and its home-ownership rate is perhaps the highest (about 90 percent).


Expanding in TV, Gannett Agrees to Buy Multimedia
Moving to expand significantly both its television and newspaper holdings, the Gannett Company said yesterday that it had agreed to a $1.7 billion acquisition of the media company that syndicates the talk shows of Phil Donahue, Sally Jessy Raphael and Rush Limbaugh.
Gannett beat out several rivals for the company, Multimedia Inc. of Greenville, S.C., which also owns cable television systems; 11 daily and 49 other newspapers, and television stations in Cleveland, Cincinnati, St.
Louis, Knoxville, Tenn., and Macon, Ga. -- all markets where Gannett has no stations.
Multimedia also owns two radio stations in Macon and a security systems business, as well as the television syndication business.

Lobbyist Disclosure Is Backed in Senate; Gift Issue Is Put Off
The Senate tonight overwhelmingly backed legislation to require registration by thousands of lobbyists who now avoid any public disclosures, but it put off the more painful question of what gifts senators could accept from them.
The lobbying bill, which reached the brink of passage before the Senate quit for the night, would broaden the narrow definition of the word "lobbyist" contained in a 1947 law that the Justice Department has scorned as inadequate and unenforceable.
It would expand the definition to require registration and reporting of those who lobby the executive branch and Congressional staff and would narrow the exemptions for lawyers.

Agent Says His Warnings Over Waco Were Ignored
A Federal undercover officer who infiltrated the Branch Davidian compound testified today that his superiors ignored his warnings that the sect's leader knew Government agents were about to arrest him.
Once the agents went ahead with the raid, he said, the deaths of all the sect's members -- and some agents -- were foreordained.
Robert Rodriguez of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms told two House subcommittees investigating the two botched Federal raids on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., that the leader, David Koresh, vowed that "neither the A.T.F. nor the National Guard will ever get me."

Cortines Ousts a School Board in Brooklyn
The New York City Schools Chancellor yesterday removed all nine members of a Brooklyn community school board who were deadlocked in their search for a new superintendent and promptly installed his own administrator and board of trustees to manage the district.
Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines took control of the district, No. 16 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, less than a year after he took over a neighboring district, No. 17, which runs from Crown Heights to Flatbush, because of political infighting and mismanagement.
But unlike board members in District 17, who mounted little opposition to the Chancellor, several board members in District 16 vowed yesterday to take legal action to block the Chancellor's takeover.


A Bright Side To Moving Out
While many of the working poor in projects like Allegheny Commons are upset at suddenly having as neighbors people who do not work, for some the pressure to move on has had beneficial results.
Essie Stevenson, who moved into her three-bedroom apartment shortly after Allegheny Commons was built two decades ago, was paying $572 a month when she was told last fall that her rent would rise to $700.
That was because she made too much money working six days a week as a grocery store cashier to qualify for Section 8 subsidies that are aimed at the poorest of the poor.

Windows 95, due Aug. 24, is an operating system in its own right, although DOS still lingers behind the scenes for those who want or need it.
Still, not everyone will switch from 3.1 to 95, just as not everyone switched from DOS to Windows.
And besides, there are ways to have fun with something that was not designed for a romp.

Doctors Can Prevent Errors Just by Listening; Under the Microscope
To the Editor:
Your report on errors in physician management of hospitalized patients (Science Times, July 18) presents situations where physician vigilance or education has been deficient.
Surgical mistakes even in dealing with horrendous injuries and catastrophic illnesses are uncommon.
But errors occur at all levels of care and are due to a multitude of causes.
I want to call your attention to the efforts at Norwalk Hospital to minimize errors and advance the education of all surgeons.
At patient discharge, every chart is scanned in the record room and all complications are brought to the attention of a quality review committee.
A complication is defined as any unanticipated development.
The committee includes members of various specialties, and membership rotates.
The responsible surgeon discusses his patient's complication, in writing or in person.
Surgeons are constantly on trial with their peers to maintain competence.
Hard work is needed to meet this professional obligation.
The patient stands to gain most by this emphasis on care and caring, by not allowing his surgeon to be an independent entrepreneur.
Such care systems exist in many hospitals.

Sanders Is Not the Star In Debut With Giants
Giants 8, Marlins 3
Deion Sanders was upstaged by a rookie teammate last night when they made their debuts for the San Francisco Giants.
Jamie Brewington pitched seven strong innings in his first major league game, earning the victory as San Francisco beat the Florida Marlins, 8-3, in Miami.
Sanders, acquired from Cincinnati in a trade on Friday, joined the team two and a half hours before the game, batted leadoff and went 1 for 6 with one putout in center field.
He singled home a run in the seventh and continued to third when center fielder Jerry Browne bobbled the ball for an error.

In the Rush Toward Gene Therapy, Some See a High Risk of Failure
IN the six years since the first corrective genes were injected into the first patient, gene therapy has exploded.
As many as 600 patients have been given gene therapy in studies, for diseases ranging from rare metabolic defects to common cancers.
Nearly half of these patients were enrolled in the last six months.
But for all the frenzy, there has not been a single published report of a patient who was helped by gene therapy.
And technical questions have multiplied.
For example, scientists have discovered that the immune system may attack and destroy cells that were treated with gene therapy, seeing them as foreign or, when the genes were transferred by a virus, as infected.


International Briefs; Norsk Hydro's Profit Up
Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian industrial giant, yesterday reported an 85 percent increase in its second-quarter profit, prompted by higher income from the farm and light-metals areas.
The overall increase came despite a 65 percent decline in operating income at the oil and gas division, the company said.
Hydro recorded after-tax profit of 1.95 billion kroner ($316 million), compared with 1.05 billion kroner ($170 million) in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Leiv Nergaard, chief financial officer and executive vice president, forecast lower earnings for the remainder of the year, especially in the third quarter.
"We expect the second half of 1995 to be characterized by normal seasonal variations," he said.
"This usually means that the third quarter is the weakest quarter of the year." (Reuters)

Editorial Notebook; Sitting in Judgment
Picture a jury growing impatient over legal wrangling at a trial, then finally appealing to the judge for a speedy end to the proceedings.
The jury in question was not the one at the O. J. Simpson murder trial.
It was an ordinary panel on which I served recently in Federal court.
The experience suggested to me that the Simpson case may be influencing courtrooms everywhere.
Our case involved a teen-age boy who fell off a fire escape and broke his leg in the Bronx two years ago.
Charging negligence, the boy's family was suing the building's management company and owner, in this case the Federal Government because the previous owner had defaulted on a Federal mortgage.
Judge Shira A. Scheindlin directed us not to discuss the case, but after three days of digressions over the phrasing of the lawyers' questions and endless arguments over whether the fire escape was in good repair, we all knew that this trial was not going to end soon.

The attack was reported by a French newspaper today but then denied by French officials.


Goals Conflict In Plan to Sell Nuclear Unit
A plan by the Federal Government to sell the operations that produce fuel for the nation's nuclear power plants -- the largest privatization ever attempted by Washington -- has long been counted on to demonstrate commitment to leaner government.
But with the White House ready to announce details of the sale this week, a debate is raging over whether such a sale would do more harm than good.
The central question is one familiar whenever a government sells off a chunk of itself: would a private owner's financial interests be at odds with the national interest?

Reviving Kitty Genovese Case, and Its Passions
The killing of Kitty Genovese was first a tragedy, then a symbol, then a bit of durable urban mythology.
Yesterday, more than 30 years after the slaying of the 28-year-old barmaid in Queens prompted painful soul-searching over whether her neighbors should have done more to help, the Kitty Genovese case was back in court.
In Federal District Court in Brooklyn, the man convicted of the murder, Winston Moseley, 60, walked out of the past, through a door and to the witness stand, where he claimed he should be granted a new trial.
His original defense lawyer -- who Mr.
Moseley now says had a conflict of interest because he had once represented Miss Genovese -- was also there, 82 years old but still practicing law.
So, too, was one of the prosecutors who tried the case in 1964.

Nice-guy Sprite gets an attitude as Coca-Cola pursues irreverent, playful young consumers.

To better appeal to core customers, thirsty teen-agers and 20-somethings, the ads have been imbued with spiky energy and a pervasive skepticism of traditional Madison Avenue promises.

In Test, New Vaccine Stops Rabies Spread
WITH coyote-borne rabies pushing north from Mexico, fox rabies immigrating south from Canada and a strain carried by raccoons sweeping up the Eastern Seaboard, the North American rabies scourge is spreading fast.
But a genetically engineered animal vaccine, the first vaccine based on recombinant DNA ever released into the environment in this country, offers hope that the plague can be kept at bay.
A large-scale trial of the oral vaccine that began last February in the southern tip of Texas seems for the moment to have virtually stopped the northward march of the disease toward San Antonio, and smaller trials in Cape May, N.J., Cape Cod, Mass., Albany, and other locales also suggest that the vaccine is not only safe but is a powerful weapon against the deadly disease.
Public health officials say no other defense against the epizootic (the animal equivalent of a human epidemic), including the slaughter of animals capable of transmitting the disease, has shown nearly such promise.

When Boukan Ginen, a roots-rock band from Haiti, had to leave the stage in the middle of its first song because of hazardous weather conditions, the audience took over, singing festival songs, chanting for more music, playing percussion on whatever was available and sending piercing whistles into the dark, rainy sky.
After more than half an hour, the drenched audience was paid back for its wait and the band returned to the stage, transferring the crowd's enthusiasm and solidarity into its live show.
Boukan Ginen is among Haiti's top new bands playing mizik rasin, a politically savvy hybrid of electric rock and traditional African and Haitian music.
Formed five years ago by three former members of Boukman Eksperyans, Boukan Ginen quickly transcended its status as a mere spin-off band with its first album, "Jou a Rive" (Xenophile).
At Summerstage, the band's leader, Eddy Francois, turned chants into anthems, singing in a big, bountiful tenor about finding freedom from poverty, redemption in work and happiness through unity.


Untimely Dispute Is Timely for Yanks
Seventeen years ago yesterday, Billy Martin stood on the mezzanine level of a Kansas City hotel and tearfully resigned from the first of what would become five terms as manager of the Yankees.
The day before, Martin, in a rage over the remorseless return of Reggie Jackson from a five-day suspension, uttered the immortal words: "The two of them deserve each other. One's a born liar; the other's convicted."
On the 17th anniversary of that declaration, two people who deserve each other were in the process of deconstructing the Darryl Strawberry deal.


Mediacom To Grow Into Global Network
Grey Advertising in New York said yesterday that it would expand its European media services company, Mediacom, into a worldwide media network that will handle accounts in 71 countries with billings estimated at more than $6 billion.


No Rest in Navratilova's Retirement
Martina Navratilova is retired.
Yet, there she was last week, playing matches in six different cities over a seven-day span for the New Jersey Stars of World TeamTennis.
"This is like paid practice," said the 38-year-old Navratilova, who will play an exhibition against Monica Seles in Atlantic City on Saturday.
"It's as good as anything, and it enables me to have good match play, which I haven't had since last November."

A $300 Investment in a Gelding Returns $69,240 to the Owners
You're tempted to say: only at Saratoga.
But a 7-year-old gelding who was sold two years ago for $300 in a bankruptcy sale won the Daryl's Joy Handicap today by the length of his bargain-basement head.
It is also not often that you see a pair of 7-year-old horses dueling down the homestretch like juveniles.
But they did it today at Saratoga with the long-shot Pride of Summer outrunning the short-shot Fourstars Allstar and winning about 230 times the amount invested in him at the bankruptcy sale.

A Writer Braces For the Attention
Adrienne Kennedy says she is not sure who has been writing her plays for more than 30 years or where they come from.
What she knows is that when insomnia rousts her before dawn, she takes up a pen in her apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and writes, filling yellow legal pads with bad dreams and autobiography, prose-poems of racial heartbreak, rage and obsession.
Then she forms the stories into dramas -- barely able, she says, to rework or witness the finished product.
Now, to Ms.
Kennedy's mingled satisfaction and dread, her works are to be thrust into the limelight.
The Signature Theater Company -- which will move this fall into temporary space at the Joseph Papp Public Theater -- has selected her work to make up its coming season, naming her its playwright in residence to succeed Romulus Linney, Lee Blessing, Edward Albee and Horton Foote.

A Pop-Memory Workout, Without Strain
Jon Bon Jovi shares a trait with the greatest rockers: He's shameless.
If he and his band, Bon Jovi, want to borrow something, they don't care who notices.
At the Jones Beach Amphitheater here on Friday night, the start of a three-night stand, Bon Jovi's stage set featured pinball machines -- "Tommy," anyone?
For the Rolling Stones-style "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead" (also a Warren Zevon title), a giant inflatable doll -- a staple of Stones tours since the 1970's -- appeared: a voluptuous woman's body with, oddly, a chicken's head.
During the song, Mr.
Bon Jovi sang part of the Temptations' "Papa Was a Rolling Stone," then switched to the Stones' "Jumpin' Jack Flash."

New York State Open
Now that he has captured his first major title in the region with his victory in the New York State Open last week, Ron McDougal is thinking about trying for the PGA Tour again.
The 32-year-old assistant at Century Country Club in Purchase, N.Y., has failed three times in his attempt to qualify for the tour, but his victory at the Concord's Monster Course last Thursday was enough to encourage him to make another attempt.


Tobacco Studies Detailed
Secret research documents show that Philip Morris U.S.A. tracked hyperactive third-graders as potential future customers and gave electrical shocks to college students to see if that would make them smoke more, Representative Henry A. Waxman of California said Monday.
One company report concluded that smokers craved nicotine more than food, he said.
Mr.
Waxman, a Democrat, unveiled stacks of documents from Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco company, on the House floor, contending that they illustrated unethical and possibly illegal research into nicotine


Focus on Susan Smith's Lies and a Smile
While the authorities searched for her two young sons, Susan Smith watched herself lie to the nation on a taped television newscast, and even smiled at the television screen, a counselor who had come to help her testified today in the penalty phase of Mrs.
Smith's capital murder trial.
The counselor, Margaret Frierson, recalled that Mrs.
Smith's incongruous smile occurred near the end of her nine days of lies, as news reporters were beginning to speculate that Mrs.
Smith might be involved in the disappearance that she had blamed on a carjacker.

Metro-North Unions Claim Right to Strike
Just four days after Metro-North riders learned, to their relief, that the railroad had invoked a Federal law to postpone a possible strike for four months, several unions yesterday called the move illegal and insisted that they still had the right to strike at any time.
Union leaders said they probably would not call a strike so long as there were signs of progress in contract talks, and both sides said they intended to resume negotiations soon.
But the statements made it clear that the unions are not ready to remove the threat of a strike from their arsenal, a threat that prompted tens of thousands of riders to stay away from the railroad last week.

Japan and South Korea have not yet agreed to join the accord.
But Sir Leon Brittan, who represents the 15 European Union nations, said at a news conference that he was confident the two nations would commit to join the pact during talks that start in Geneva Wednesday.


Lawyers Want Reno Barred From Death-Penalty Decision in Bombing
Lawyers for a former Army sergeant held in the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building said today that they would ask a Federal judge to disqualify Attorney General Janet Reno from participating in the Government's decision on whether to seek the death penalty in the case.
In a motion to be filed on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Oklahoma City, lawyers for Timothy J. McVeigh, one of two men held in the blast, will seek the removal of Ms.
Reno and other Justice Department officials.
Their removal is being sought on the ground that Ms.
Reno, who must review the local prosecutor's recommendation on whether to seek the death penalty, has already said she supports a sentence of death for the Oklahoma City bombers.

Bosnian Serb forces committed wide-scale acts of barbarism when they seized the "safe area" of Srebrenica two weeks ago, the United Nations Secretary General's special representative for human rights in the former Yugoslavia said today.
At a news conference here, the official, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, also warned of atrocities on the same or a larger scale in Zepa, and condemned the international community for failing to protect that safe area, which has been the scene of heavy fighting for more than a week.

"We cannot undo history," the President said in awarding the commission to the heirs of Johnson Chesnut Whittaker, one of the first black cadets at West Point, 64 years after his death.
"But today, finally, we can pay tribute to a great American and we can acknowledge a great injustice."

Tourist Is Stabbed in Back Fighting West Side Attacker

The crime shook up both residents and tourists in the affluent neighborhood around the Dakota apartments, an area where violent attacks are relatively rare.

State Power Agency To Name Leader
The trustees of the New York Power Authority are expected to meet today to name Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr., the former minority leader of the State Assembly, to head the agency.
He would replace S. David Freeman, the current president and chief executive officer.
Earlier this year, the Legislature approved a law giving authority to the trustees to designate who would be chief executive and to increase his or her pay.
Mr.
Rappleyea, who resigned last month as minority leader, could thus be paid more than the $82,500 salary he received in that post.


Mayor's Rating Rises As Crime Rate Falls
A drop in the city's crime rate has apparently helped bring a modest improvement in Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's approval ratings, according to a poll released yesterday.
The poll, conducted by Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Conn., indicated that 50 percent of the people surveyed this month approved of Mr.
Giuliani's performance, compared with 46 percent in a poll a month ago.
The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.

Giants Try to Get Young Tackle To Turn His Fury on Their Foes
If you ever see Chris Maumalanga on the street, don't cross to the other side.
You would like him.
He would ask how your family is doing.
He might ask if you need anything.
He might invite you to dinner.
On him.
That is how Maumalanga is most of the time: personable and charming.
Just don't taunt him.
Don't try to show him up.
If you do, take a step back and get ready.
Linebacker Mitch Davis found it out the hard way in late June.
Maumalanga and a small group of players were sitting around talking when the 6-foot-3-inch, 240-pound Davis joked that he wanted Maumalanga to go downstairs and get his keys.
Maumalanga said no.
Davis, half joking, half trying to embarrass Maumalanga in front of his friends, asked again.
Maumalanga punched him in the face.

Love Songs and Understatement
The virtues of pre-rock pop are still cherished in Brazil.
There, songwriters work on serpentine chord progressions and subtle metaphors, confident that they can please listeners with ingenuity rather than impact.
Djavan, who has been one of Brazil's leading songwriters since the late 1970's, had the audience singing along, reverently and joyfully, when he performed on Saturday night at Roseland; his understatement was treasured.
Djavan Caetano Viana, who was born in the state of Alagoas in northern Brazil, emerged as a songwriter shortly after the musical and political upheavals of the late 1960's.
He specializes in gentle, smoothly phrased love songs, but carries on the musical eclecticism and poetic sophistication of the MPB (Musica Popular Brasileira) movement.
In "Limao" ("Lime"), from his current album "Novena" (Epic Brazil), he sees a sunrise and the promise of countless new beginnings as he cuts a lime to serve with a fish.

For Most U.S. Households, Inheritances Hardly Count
Benjamin Franklin and your mother may have been right after all, at least according to a new study: affluent Americans typically got that way by staying healthy, getting married and working hard for a good wage, rather than by inheriting their money.
A number of studies in recent years have pointed to a greater concentration of wealth and income among fewer and fewer people, prompting some calls for higher taxes on inheritances to prevent a widening of class divisions.
But two surveys covering a total of 20,000 Americans over 50 show that health, marital status and income are the main determinants of wealth, according to a study released today by Rand, a research group based in Santa Monica, Calif.


BUSINESS DIGEST
Bonds and Stocks Rebound From Last Week's Retreat Prices of 30-year Treasury bonds regained some ground from last week's retreat, rising more than a point.
The gains pushed Treasury yields down to 6.87 percent, from 6.96 percent on Friday.  [ Page D9. ] Technology stocks also rebounded from a decline last week, with the Nasdaq index rising 16.80 points, to 978.57.
The Dow industrials rose 27.12 points, to 4,668.67, and the S.&amp; P. 500-stock index rose 3.01 points, to 556.63.  [ D10. ] Star Manager to Start New Fund  Paul H. Wick, whose technology fund has led stock mutual funds in gains over the last five years, plans to start a new fund to invest in small technology companies.
But when assets reach $125 million, it will be closed, and that could be very soon.
Market Place.  [ D10. ] American Express Net Up 14.8%  American Express reported a 14.8 percent gain in its second-quarter earnings, to $410 million, or 81 cents a share, exceeding Wall Street's expectations, as its customers spent more on their charge cards.
It agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay a $2.5 million criminal fine.  [ A8. ] Prodigy Seeks to Reargue Case  Prodigy said it would try to reargue its defense in a suit brought by a brokerage firm, Stratton Oakmont, which contends it had been libeled by comments distributed by the on-line service.  [ D2. ] An About-Face for Sprite  Lowe &amp; Partners/SMS has revamped the Sprite persona to naughty from nice, in a campaign that mocks the conventions of soft-drink marketing.
Out went the syrupy jingle "I like the Sprite in you" and the strange fruit, the "lymon." To better appeal to core customers, the ads have been imbued with a skepticism of traditional Madison Avenue promises.

A Shelter and a Storm; As Tax Breaks Change, the Working Poor Lose Out
For a dozen years Art and Geneva Terry loved living in Allegheny Commons, an apartment project built under a Great Society program that married the needs of the working poor for housing and the desires of the wealthy for tax shelters.
Nights at the project fell silent and safe, because the residents of the 134 apartments went to sleep early so they could get up to go to work.
That silence has vanished.
This summer, jobless young men congregate in the parking lot, drinking beer from 40-ounce bottles while waiting for another car to pull off the street for a furtive exchange of dollars and drugs.
On one steamy night last month a toddler wearing only a diaper wandered on the sidewalk long past dark, while a boom box kept the sandman at bay.

A Bold, Imperfect Medicare Plan
House Republicans say they must reform Medicare because the 30-year-old program of health insurance for the elderly is headed for bankruptcy.
The assertion is true.
But the G.O.P. is also manipulating Medicare's financial straits so it can make major cuts and thus honor its promise to balance the budget by 2002 while reducing taxes.
The Republicans deserve credit for even thinking about tampering with a heavily subsidized, sacrosanct program that is jealously protected by a powerful voting bloc.
They also deserve credit for outlining a vision of a Medicare program that provides better, less costly care.
But in their zeal to cut the deficit, they could cause serious damage.

Forgotten Riches of King Tut: His Wardrobe
WHEN the Egyptologist Howard Carter uncovered the tomb of the Pharaoh Tutankhamen in 1922, it was the brilliant gold of the funeral mask and other artifacts that awed the world.
But the tomb also contained wooden chests filled with the boy king's clothes and footwear.
Along with most of the rest of the treasures, the bulk of the textiles, some reduced to dust, ended up in a storeroom at the Cairo Museum.
When Mr.
Carter died in 1939, his Tutankhamen archive, including 1,500 photographs, many drawings and 2,500 note cards documenting the textiles, was deposited at the Griffith Institute at Oxford University in England.
And there the materials sat for more than five decades, virtually forgotten by all but a few scholars whose general opinion was that nothing could be done because of the supposed poor state of the textiles and the difficulty in obtaining access from the cautious Egyptian authorities.

Man Charged in Clinic Killings Is Called 'Delusional' by Doctor
On the first day of a hearing to determine if he is competent to stand trial, a man accused of killing two women at abortion clinics in Brookline, Mass., last year was called "schizophrenic, undifferentiated and delusional" by a psychiatrist today.
Later the defendant, John C. Salvi 3d, was removed from the courtroom by guards after an outburst in which he demanded to speak.


Two Comptrollers Contest Mayor's Budget Estimates
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's newly adopted city budget for 1996 may be balanced on paper, but both the city and state comptrollers charged yesterday that the appearance of balance is actually based on hundreds of millions of dollars in questionable assumptions.
City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said that as much as $1 billion of the Mayor's $31.1 billion budget consists of revenue estimates or planned spending cuts that may not happen.
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall went even further, saying the city's budget is now actually unbalanced by nearly $400 million.
He also identified another $400 million in shaky assumptions.

'Wanderer' Repeated and a Rhapsody Unbuttoned
Odd notion that the orchestra should ever seem superfluous in a concert by the New York Philharmonic.
But the Philharmonic had only itself to blame on Friday evening when it played Liszt's orchestration of Schubert's "Wanderer" Fantasy after presenting the original version for solo piano in a preconcert recital.
Anyone who heard both might have found Liszt's sound and fury intrusive.
In any case, it is a brave performer who will play the work twice in an evening, as Peter Roesel, a German pianist, did here.
If the original came out sounding a bit like full-blown Liszt, with a basically steely sound wrapped in a pedaled haze, Mr.
Roesel could be forgiven; keeping the two versions straight in his memory must have been hard enough, let alone finding radically different styles for them.

Panthers Promote From Within By Hiring MacLean as Coach
DOUG MacLEAN, player development director of the Florida Panthers, was hired yesterday as head coach in a move that management hopes will bring a more aggressive brand of hockey and a spot in the playoffs.
MacLean signed a three-year contract to replace ROGER NEILSON, who was dismissed on June 8.
General Manager BRYAN MURRAY did not agree with Neilson's conservative style and reliance on veterans.
The Panthers' record under Neilson was 53-56-23, but the team had the weakest offense in the National Hockey League.

Senate Debates Arms Ban
In a struggle for control over foreign policy, the Senate opened debate today on a Republican bill to end American participation in the arms embargo against Bosnia, while Senate Democrats and the Clinton Administration waged an offensive to blunt the effort.
Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, the majority leader and co-sponsor of the bill, criticized the Administration for a lack of leadership that he said has allowed the United Nations to decide when and whether NATO will use air strikes to punish the Serbs.


'Bright Star' of Navajo Nation Gets Prison Term in Fatal Crash
It was almost midnight, after more than nine hours of emotional testimony in a packed New Mexico courtroom on Monday, when Judge James Blackmer announced his difficult decision: Gordon House would be sentenced to 22 years in prison for the four deaths he caused in a drunken-driving car crash on Christmas Eve 1992.
The District Court judge, saying he had had trouble sleeping for days, acknowledged that Mr.
House was "definitely a bright star to the Navajo nation and to our state as well." But he said the case was "not about race but alcohol, an equal opportunity destroyer."

In Korea, Democracy Still Has Far to Go
To the Editor:
Your July 19 news article on the hastiness of South Korea's postwar construction boom highlights the darker underside of Korea's "economic miracle." However, as I learned on a trip there last month, it is not only the recent construction boom that rests on a dangerous foundation.
The transition to the "New Korea" promised by President Kim Young Sam, where internationally guaranteed human rights would be respected, remains dangerously incomplete.
The laws authorizing arbitrary arrest and detention, suppression of free association, expression and assembly that propped up decades of military rule are actively used by President Kim against political opponents and labor activists.

Euro Disney Reports Its First Profits
After nearly three years of heavy losses and a near brush with bankruptcy, Euro Disney, operator of the largest theme park in Europe, announced its first quarterly profit today.
While the results were better than expected, analysts were quick to caution that they did not mean that the theme park, which has generated almost $1.5 billion in losses since it opened in April 1992, was past its financial troubles.
For one, the results were bolstered in large part because the company does not have to pay interest on $3.61 billion in debt until 1997.

Stored A-Bombs Creating Health Risks, Study Says
A sweeping study of global nuclear weapons production has concluded that the bombs, although used only twice in war, have still been responsible for extensive destruction, producing millions of tons of toxic and radioactive waste, massive damage to the environment and untold effects on human health.
The study, produced over six years by the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and a small Washington group that specializes in the field, asserts that because of damage to human health "destruction before detonation is the hallmark of nuclear weapons production."

G.O.P. Puts Heat on the Commerce Dept.
With a summer heat wave that has gripped the capital for weeks, it was only a matter of time before Democrats and Republicans began bickering over what to do about the weather -- and more specifically, whether predicting it is still a legitimate role of government.
How to deal with the Government's giant weather bureaucracy -- privatize it, restructure it or cut its budget drastically -- is just one of the bitter arguments that broke out this week as Congress began to tackle the messy business of dismantling the Commerce Department, an invention of President Theodore Roosevelt that has come to embody all that the Republicans, especially the tear-it-up freshmen, say is wrong with big government.

Journal; Scandal For Profit
If anyone doubts whether Hugh Grant is as smart as the witty characters he plays, consider this: It cost him only a $60 fee -- plus a $1,180 fine -- to make sure that inattentive summer audiences wouldn't ignore his first big-studio American movie, "Nine Months," on which his future as a Hollywood megastar depends.
Contrast that with the duncelike deportment of Kevin Costner, who has so far run up $172 million to insure that his summer vehicle, "Waterworld," won't capsize as quickly as the preceding three flops that have brought his own career as a Hollywood star to the brink.

Areas rated included the number of women who die during childbirth, teen-age pregnancy, contraceptive use, prenatal care and availability of safe abortions.

New Jersey High Court Upholds Law Identifying Sex Offenders
New Jersey's Supreme Court today upheld the constitutionality of alerting communities to the presence of sex offenders, saying that "to rule otherwise is to find that society is unable to protect itself from sexual predators."
The 6-to-1 ruling put the state's highest court at odds with a Federal judge in Newark, Nicholas H. Politan, who struck down "Megan's Law" last February on the ground that its notification provisions were illegal extra punishment for sex offenders who had already served their prison terms.

Stop thinking of them as members of Congress.

True, the Senate voted yesterday to set up a new registration system for lobbyists.
But Congress has yet to pass a much more significant companion bill that would bar lobbyists from plying senators and representatives with free meals, free entertainment and free vacations.
The registration bill, championed by Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, is a useful advance for open government.
It would plug loopholes in the system that allow many lobbyists to avoid registration, and it would require lobbyists to disclose whom they represent, how much they are paid and on what issues they are lobbying.

In its heyday in the 1930's, when movie starlets and rich financiers walked the crowded streets, Shanghai was known as "the pearl of the Orient."

Study Finds Pesticides in Baby Food
LOW levels of pesticides are found in all major brands of baby food sold in the United States, according to a study released today.
The levels are well below the standards set by the Federal Government, but those standards are geared to the tolerances of adults, not children.
The report, issued by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research organization in Washington, says the "residues do not pose an immediate health risk." It comes at a time when many in Congress are pressing for changes in pesticide regulations that critics say would make them less stringent.

But the politics of the aftermath were something very new.

F.B.I. Overreacted in Waco, Witnesses Say
A series of witnesses told Congress today that they were confident the Branch Davidians would soon have surrendered if the Federal Bureau of Investigation had not used tear gas and assault vehicles to invade their compound outside Waco, Tex.
The testimony before two House committees jointly investigating the deaths near Waco in April 1993 came from two lawyers who had negotiated with sect members during the 51-day siege.
Testimony from the witness today had been scheduled by committee Republicans to show that the loss of patience by the F.B.I. at the end of the siege was a critical mistake and largely responsible for the deaths of about 80 people when the Davidians' compound went up in flames shortly after the assault.

Far from doing away with the cumbersome "dual key" arrangement that the United States says has hampered NATO's ability to protect United Nations peacekeepers on the ground, the NATO allies in effect have sided with the United Nations Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has been saying nobody could take his key away from him.

A state appointment of a trustee to manage the county's fiscal affairs would be an action with little precedent: there have been few seizures of municipalities since the Depression, and never of a government of this size.
But the magnitude of the county's bankruptcy -- its debts are around $1.9 billion -- and the county's inability to draft a plan to pay its creditors are creating a situation in which state intervention is all but certain.


Jet Defense Gets Set To Rev Up The Attack
The Jets' attitude problem on defense may finally be channeled and used to disrupt the other team instead of themselves.
Even now, awaiting today's first summer-camp workout in pads, Mo Lewis frowns when he recalls how angry he was with some of his own teammates during last season's demise, when the Jets suffered the same old choke-hold.
The inevitable squabbling followed.


N.B.A. Says It Is Willing to Address Players' Concerns
Five weeks after they thought they had completed labor negotiations for the next six seasons, officials of the National Basketball Association and its union of locked-out players returned to the bargaining table yesterday but made no instant progress toward another agreement.
"We discussed and covered a lot of areas," Commissioner David Stern said after the five-hour meeting at a midtown Manhattan hotel.
"I can't say that substantial progress was made, but we did indicate the owners' willingness to attempt to address areas of concern that have been raised by the players as long as a deal remained sensible economically."


Highway Plan For West Side Appears Dead
Under attack in Congress and from the Giuliani administration, a plan to tear down a newly rebuilt stretch of the West Side Highway and reconstruct it alongside Donald J. Trump's planned Riverside South development appears dead, at least for now.
An associate of Mr.
Trump said the $2 billion Riverside South project, the most ambitious building effort in Manhattan in decades, will go ahead unimpeded, with construction starting in about six months.
But Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, an Upper West Side Democrat who is an ardent opponent of Riverside South, said the death of the highway project could endanger the entire development.


Many U.S. Aides Seem Sure That French Bombed Serbs
In the face of vehement French denials, senior American officials said today that they still believe that France bombed the Bosnian Serbs' headquarters at Pale over the weekend.
Administration officials said they had circumstantial evidence and a report from a "usually reliable" intelligence source with ties to the French Government, but not a photograph of a bomb crater or other irrefutable proof.


Devils' Cup Banner To Be Raised Oct. 7
The Devils will raise their Stanley Cup championship banner at Byrne Meadowlands Arena before an afternoon game against the Florida Panthers on Oct. 7, the National Hockey League said yesterday in releasing its 1995-96 schedule.

The Rangers will play at Hartford before their home opener on Oct. 11 against the Winnipeg Jets.


New York Buyouts Could Leave Gaps In Teaching Ranks
Thousands of New York City teachers are preparing to retire early under a buyout plan, and educators say the exodus will leave behind a younger teaching force and probably, shortages in math, science and social studies teachers.
So far, 3,450 of the city's 68,500 teachers and 1,745 other school employees, including 105 principals and 191 assistant principals, have told the Board of Education that they plan to take advantage of the incentive program, a budget-cutting measure that offers teachers extra credit toward their pension plans.
About 1,200 teachers usually retire each year, board officials say.


METRO DIGEST
SEX-OFFENDER LAW UPHELD IN NEW JERSEY
New Jersey's Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of alerting communities of the presence of sex offenders, saying that "to rule otherwise is to find that society is unable to protect itself from sexual predators."  [ Page A1. ]
Governor Pataki signed legislation that will require convicted sex offenders to notify the state about where they are living long after they are released from prison.  [ B2. ]


Morceli Just Misses Another Record
The biggest name in middle-distance running was rounding the final turn of the 1,500-meter run, and the crowd in this very small principality was stomping its well-heeled feet.

C.I.A. Says Agents Deceived Superiors On Guatemala Role
An internal Central Intelligence Agency investigation into the agency's conduct in Guatemala concludes that C.I.A. officers there failed to disclose their clandestine activities to two United States Ambassadors, to Congress and to the agency itself, intelligence officials said tonight.
The report found that C.I.A. officers in Guatemala broke no laws in connection with the deaths in Guatemala of an American innkeeper and the husband of an American lawyer, and it does not establish that a man identified as a paid C.I.A. informer was their killer, the officials said.

Hormel Sues Over a Boarish Film Muppet
Perhaps the makers of Spam, the much-maligned pork luncheon meat, have been the target of too many jokes over the years, but executives of the Hormel Foods Corporation are certainly not laughing at the latest Muppet movie.
The movie, "Muppet Treasure Island," features a wild-boar puppet named Spa'am who runs amok, and the makers of Spam, which has been around since 1937, have sued in Federal court in Manhattan, claiming trademark infringement.

Sports of The Times; It's Love For Sale By the Bay
JUST when the baseball season seemed to have hit a snail's pace, the Cincinnati Reds and the San Francisco Giants made a trade that puts two of the most enigmatic talents in professional sports on the same team: one is the Prince of Light, one the Prince of Darkness.
On Monday, Deion Sanders was traded from the pennant-bound Reds to the last-place Giants, a move that raised hopes for San Francisco's Super Bowl champion 49ers that Sanders, a free agent in football, will return to the team this season.


A Music Capital Tangled Up in Freedom
With a distinguished lineage of composers and performers, Prague has long cherished itself as one of Europe's enduring music centers.
Now, however, the city's musicians and their managers say standards are slipping, as ensembles, opera companies and Prague's world-famous orchestra adjust to the whims and temptations of the free market.
At the heart of the turmoil has been a dogfight at the Czech Philharmonic, an icon here.
Adding to the disenchantment, many seasoned musicians say, the city's two resident opera companies are saddled with overloaded schedules and skimpy budgets, and as a consequence give lackluster performances.


Mr. Cortines Acts Boldly
For the second time in eight months the New York City Schools Chancellor, Ramon Cortines, has suspended a local school board -- in this case a Brooklyn board that has dithered in finding a superintendent.
This is a clear failure of educational leadership, and Mr.
Cortines has made the right move.
But some board members now threaten to sue on grounds that he has no clear authority to dismiss a board just because he is displeased with its stewardship.
It is therefore time for the State Legislature in Albany to clarify the chancellor's powers.
Under state law, the central board has responsibility for overall policy and high schools.
The 32 community boards are responsible for junior high and elementary schools and for hiring superintendents, principals and other staff.
The chancellor has clear authority to step in when local boards are found to be corrupt.
His authority to intervene in other circumstances is less clear.

No Intention To Question First Lady
The chairman of the Senate committee investigating the Whitewater affair today ruled out calling Hillary Rodham Clinton as a witness unless strong evidence emerged of her involvement in the mishandling of papers from the office of a White House aide who committed suicide two years ago.

Clinton testify that she would not be called "unless there is clear and convincing facts and reason" to do so.

Lisa R. Kruse, a Treasury Department spokeswoman, said using private dollars would not only save tax money but would also bring in revenue because the public has an "almost insatiable appetite" for history, The Associated Press reported.

Foreign Affairs; The End of Something
The U.S. consulate in Bordeaux died last week.
It was 205 years old.
The oldest living consulate in American diplomatic history succumbed to a variety of ailments, including CNN disease, faxatosis, AT&amp;T-Direct, global integration and most of all the lingering effects of a Congressional ax attack.
The Bordeaux consulate is survived by the American Embassy in Paris and its sisters, the U.S. consulates in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
Memorial donations may be sent to the General Operating Fund of the U.S.
State Department in Washington. (It needs the money.) No memorial service is planned.
Yes, in case you missed it, the State Department announced last week that to appease Congressional budget-cutters it was closing down 19 consulates and embassies, including Bordeaux.
Normally the closure of a consulate with two U.S. diplomats and nine locals would not be worthy of note, but Bordeaux is a bit different.
It was opened by the Washington Administration -- that's George Washington -- in 1790 as America's first consulate abroad.
In closing consulates like Bordeaux, the U.S. is turning its back on the past and the future of U.S. foreign policy for the sake of the present.


Personal Health; Sorting out the benefits of taking extra vitamin E.
IN a nation hungry for simple nutritional solutions to complex health problems, vitamin E might seem to be a panacea.
Various studies have singled it out as the most promising and possibly the safest antidote to the nation's leading killers, heart disease and cancer.
And, while it is protecting coronary arteries against atherosclerosis and DNA against attacks by chemical carcinogens, it may also be keeping normal cells throughout the body from aging prematurely.
But vitamin E, chemically named alpha-tocopherol, does all this and more at levels well above those needed to prevent a nutritional deficiency, levels that render it a drug, not a nutrient.
As a vitamin, it aids in the formation of red blood cells, muscles and other tissues and prevents oxidation of vitamin A and essential fatty acids.
At high levels not attainable through diet -- 40 times or more the nutritionally needed amount -- vitamin E functions as a potent antioxidant.
Why Not Take It?
Well, then, shouldn't everybody take vitamin E supplements?
Certainly, most if not all researchers who study it are taking it, but most are not yet willing to tell the general public to do the same.
Are these scientists being hypocritical, telling us one thing and doing another?

Treasurys Close Mixed Following Latest Data
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with the long bond up, despite a barrage of indicators that suggested a sustained healthy economy would make it unnecessary for the Federal Reserve to lower rates again.
The 30-year bond gained 22/32 of a percentage point, to a price of 110 5/32.
It yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.82 percent, from 6.87 percent on Monday and down from 6.92 percent at its worst point during the day.
In the shorter maturities, bill rates were up about one-hundredth of a percentage point, and intermediate maturities were mixed.

Market Place; Between a company's news and trading activity, a puzzling lag.
WALTER INDUSTRIES, a home-building conglomerate that recently emerged from a messy six-year bankruptcy, took its new shareholders for a roller-coaster ride yesterday.

But then, these people have massive Mount Rainier in their backyard; perhaps a little exaggeration, a sense of extravagance are not all that much out of place.
In this setting, even a raspberry has to be pretty big to get noticed.

Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who immediately flew by helicopter to the scene of the blast, said, "There is very strong suspicion of an attack." A police statement said later that an explosive device of "several kilos" was involved.


Food Notes
White, Sweet Nectarines
This summer, many specialty stores are selling white-flesh nectarines, which are sweeter than the yellow kind.
Nectarines originally had white flesh.
They became yellow only when horticulturists started cross-breeding them with peaches to make them bigger and firmer for shipping.
White peaches are also enjoying renewed popularity, and white apricots may begin to appear in stores next year.

A Wistful Sendoff-cum-Wake For That Paradise of the North
After five seasons on CBS, "Northern Exposure" comes to a close this evening.
It's time.
The show's distinctive whimsy began to grow perilously thin a year or two ago.
Cast changes, most notably the departure of Rob Morrow, who played the central and somewhat irritating character of whiny Joel Fleischman, proved fatal.
In tonight's wrap-up, several major players like John Cullum's Holling, Janine Turner's Maggie and John Corbett's Chris barely muster enough energy to put in brief appearances.
All of which shouldn't detract from the inventiveness and accomplishments of "Northern Exposure" at its best.
When Joel, a New Yorker and recent medical-school graduate, arrived in the outpost town of Cicely, Alaska, to pay off scholarship obligations, a wonderfully offbeat community sprouted up in prime time.
The barmy residents were the brainchildren of Joshua Brand and John Falsey, the creative team whose other credits include "St. Elsewhere."

Tatars vs. Turks at Glimmerglass
The 900-seat Alice Busch Opera Theater of the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., is a wonderfully intimate place to hear almost any opera.
But it is an ideal facility for the operas of Handel.
The production of Handel's "Tamerlano," directed by Jonathan Miller, that opened here on Saturday night was as close to ideal as one could hope for.
Frantic to provide a new work for the 1724 season of his London opera company, Handel composed the basic draft of "Tamerlano" in just 20 days.
In a less sensitive production, this opera, Handel's 18th, could seem a formulaic rush job: 27 arias, 2 duets, 1 trio and a final quartet.

Simpson's trial.

Congressional Roundup; Registering Lobbyists
The Senate voted 98 to 0 today to require thousands of additional lobbyists to register and disclose their activities, but reached no agreement about limiting gifts from lobbyists and others.
In a series of closed meetings, supporters of efforts to tighten limits on gifts failed to make much progress towards compromise with foes.
But Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said he was hopeful of winning support for a new idea he was promoting: that Congress put itself under the same strict limits that apply to officials in the executive branch, who are barred from accepting just about all gifts worth more than $20.


Business Travel; Some airlines are going to great lengths to shorten flying time between North America and Asia.
WITH little fanfare, Asian-bound passengers from the United States and Canada have been able to shorten their flying time across the Pacific Ocean by as much as three hours.
While the flights benefit business and leisure travelers equally, the real motivation behind many of the flights is to make flying more convenient for business travelers, who pay the highest fares.
Northwest Airlines, for example, is so determined to accommodate its business travelers to Asia that on some flights it chooses to carry fewer leisure passengers and less cargo.
While it flies in the face of conventional aviation wisdom to leave passengers behind on planes that are not full, Northwest's purpose is to eliminate stops en route that otherwise would be necessary for planes carrying heavier loads.

Cecil Taylor's Band Without Cecil Taylor
Cecil Taylor's big band opened its first show at the Knitting Factory on Monday night with Mr.
Taylor reading poetry offstage.
A few members stood around offering bleats or whirs as accompaniment.
Then the rest of the 30-odd-member group filtered in, sprawling across the stage and into the audience.
They entered chanting, but when they sat down to play, what came out was less substantial than their entrance.
This was clearly a local community event.
Mr.
Taylor, who did not perform at all, began holding open rehearsals for this big band several months ago.
Apparently anyone who thought he had a contribution to make joined.
The process was democratic, and so was the music: it wasn't until 45 minutes into the performance that a soloist appeared.
It gave the performance a festive, communal feeling, and if the music didn't really work, its lack of order seemed secondary on such a hot summer night.
What counted was its sense of fun and its narrative.

Braving the Full Sunlight
"Now you know what we look like during the daytime," Mary Hansen of Stereolab, a group of pop-music experimenters from England, said on Saturday afternoon at Central Park Summerstage.
The nearly three-hour concert paired two acts normally seen at night: Stereolab, rock-club regulars, and John Cale, a former member of the Velvet Underground whose solo music seems best suited to art bars and cabarets.
Despite shaky beginnings, the pale, sweaty acts flourished instead of melting in the afternoon sun.
Stereolab's music is a mixture all its own.
In sweet, light pop songs, the English band connects the dots between its different obsessions, from synthesizer history to Marxist rhetoric, from 1950's kitsch to 1970's progressive rock.
On Saturday, the band didn't perform with as much archival electronic gear as it had in the past.
But the droning organ of Morgane Lhote kept the band's smart bubble gum pop anchored to the ground while Laetitia Sadier's Moog synthesizer gurgled and sputtered on top.
Ms.
Sadier sang most of the vocals in a dulcet French accent as Ms.
Hansen harmonized with oohs and aahs, turning slogans like "We want unconditional rebellion" into harmless sing-alongs.

Defining and Proving Rights Abuses: Debate Splits Amnesty International
When Amnesty International reported that Rwandan Hutu in exile in Zaire were being secretly re-armed by foreign governments, it was big news.
Many Hutu, after all, had been responsible for the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi in Rwanda.
But within Amnesty there was opposition to releasing the report.
In a major departure, most of the accusations were based on secondary sources -- politicians, news media, other rights organizations -- rather than on Amnesty's own research.


Looking Backward in India
India's recent drive toward economic liberalization is a remarkable success story in the developing world.
With overseas investment pouring in, the economy has boomed.
But now many of India's gains are imperiled by a recrudescence of nationalist sentiment that threatens to drive foreign companies away.
Fear of economic colonization is as old as India itself, but India's leaders must transcend these anxieties if future progress is to be secured.
The focus of the latest anti-foreign hysteria is a proposed $2.8 billion power plant to be constructed outside Bombay by a consortium of American companies led by the Enron Corporation of Houston, a large natural gas supplier.
The plant would be the biggest foreign investment in India since the economy started opening up five years ago.
It is also desperately needed.

'Safe' Town In Bosnia Falls to Serbs
Bosnian Serb troops captured the town of Zepa today, the heart of another United Nations "safe area," but the surrounding hills were full of Bosnian Government troops and Muslim refugees, and it was unclear how much territory was under Serbian control.
After a weeklong assault on Zepa, the Bosnian Serb troops entered the town today, but Bosnian radio said that the Government troops still controlled a "substantial stretch of territory" in the enclave, which is made up of more than 20 villages.


California Action to Benefit Minority Students
To the Editor:
Re your July 21 news article about the rejection of affirmative action by the University of California Board of Regents:

A Realistic Entity: Greater Sarajevo
The fall of the isolated Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia, including Zepa yesterday, may be a blessing in disguise.
In threatening air strikes to protect the "safe havens," NATO is misguided.
The eventual withdrawal of Muslim troops and civilians from Gorazde, Bihac and Tuzla could hold the key to a political settlement.
The Bosnian Government should have abandoned these towns long ago.
They were held because they were considered useful in the effort to reclaim lost territories and because the plight of their refugees engaged the conscience of the West.
Now the Bosnian Government should scale back its unrealistic ambitions and withdraw its army to establish a viable, independent republic around Sarajevo.


Washington Mayor Concedes Necessity of Job Cuts for Budget
In his first public admission that many city workers will lose their jobs in a plan to return the District of Columbia to financial stability, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. said today that as many as 1,500 people, about 4 percent of the work force, could be dismissed over the next two years.
The job cuts are part of Mr.
Barry's response to recommendations by the Federal Financial Control Board to guide the city out of its financial crisis.
The board, appointed by President Clinton, earlier this month advised the city to eliminate 5,600 positions.
Most of those job savings are expected to be achieved through attrition and early retirement.


Muslim Refugees Raise Tensions in Serb Village
Pero Milosevic's family has been living in this Serbian village in the forested Majevica mountains for 300 years, and he is determined to remain.
"This village is our home, and we can't leave," he said, sitting under grape vines strung over a latticework in the yard of his two-story house.


Big clients remain few at Jerry &amp; Ketchum, but this time Della Femina sees no need to exaggerate.
ALONG Madison Avenue, people keep asking a question that echoes the cry from the old JGE appliance chain commercials: "What's the story, Jerry?"
The Jerry is Jerry Della Femina, the flamboyant adman, author, columnist, restaurateur and retailer who is the chairman, chief executive and creative director of Jerry &amp; Ketchum in New York.
And the story they want to hear is how he is faring with his agency, formed 15 months ago in a joint venture with Ketchum Communications after he spent more than a year running a small shop, Jerry Inc.


4 Months Later, Viacom Revives A Sale to Tele-Communications
After months of tortuous negotiations, Viacom Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to spin off its cable systems to Tele-Communications Inc. in a deal valued at about $2.25 billion.
The deal is structured as a spinoff rather than a sale so that Viacom can avoid paying onerous capital-gains taxes, according to executives at both companies.
Viacom's desire for a tax-free transaction has driven the talks with Tele-Communications from the outset: Congress blocked the companies' previous attempt at a tax-free cable deal in March.

WHEN it's hot outside, no one wants lots of pots boiling on the stove.
Today's menu can be made in one pot.

Milking a cow might not seem to be part of the job description for Mayor of Elizabeth.
But Mayor J. Christian Bollwage will gamely put hand to udder today when a cow and her calf arrive at O'Brien Field from a farm in Andover, in Sussex County, to publicize the city's summer lunch program.
The Federally and state-financed program feeds 1,100 children in the city at a cost of just over $100,000 for the summer.
Mayor Bollwage said some city children would be seeing a cow for the first time.

Earnings and Jet Orders Lift Boeing's Stock to Record High

The combined news propelled its stock to an all-time high of $67 before closing at $66, up $2, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.


Heartbreak, Rockabilly, Honky-Tonk And Blues
Rosie Flores was a spinning wheel of American roots music on Sunday night at the Mercury Lounge, circling from rockabilly to blues to honky-tonk to Tex-Mex and back to rockabilly.
But she spun only one thread: heartbreak.
She shouted about it and wept over it, laughed about it and danced over it in a sturdy, dynamic voice.
In 1987, Ms.
Flores was a contender for country stardom when she released her first album, "Rosie Flores," on Warner Brothers/Reprise Records.
But after conflicts with the label, Ms.
Flores was dropped.
Five years later, she returned on the independent label Hightone as a more original and individual singer and guitarist with a range far beyond that of most country-pop aspirants.
Her fourth album, "Rockabilly Filly," to be released on Hightone on Sept. 15, takes her farther off the Nashville trail and deeper into her roots with collaborations with the rockabilly pioneers Wanda Jackson and Janis Martin.

Giuliani and Board to Share Ideas on Search for Chancellor
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Board of Education have yet to agree on much of anything regarding the search for a new chancellor for New York City's schools, but yesterday they agreed at least to meet to share their ideas on the matter.
The announcement of a meeting, scheduled for Aug. 16, follows weeks of rancor between the Mayor and a majority of the board's members after the resignation of Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines last month.


Required Reading: Grisham, Clancy, Rice and Proust
When summer heats up, the reading list of the average college student splits three ways.
It's a division that reflects struggle among three impulses.
The urge toward enlightenment wrestles with the need to find a job, and both can be pinned to the mat by the swinish desire to wallow in trash.
An informal survey of college bookstores around the country yields a best-seller list that is fraught with contradictions.
Some titles, tony and highbrow, suggest that America's colleges really are coaching the best and the brightest for victory in a highly competitive world economy.
There are others -- many of them, in fact -- that paint a different picture of the college population.

A rather healthy but apparently not-so-virile elderly gentleman strolled into the operating room for correction of his problem.
As the anesthesia resident in the Operating Room that day, I examined his chart as I prepared him for the anesthetic.

However, under the section asking patients to "list all current conditions," he had simply scribbled, "In love." MICHAEL LOCKER

The other day we went to see "Apollo 13." After we settled in our seats, a young couple -- apparently on their first or second date -- sat in the row behind us.

"Get some popcorn," she replied.
"What size?"
"It's a three-hour movie; get me a three-hour popcorn."
When the movie was over, after approximately 2 hours and 10 minutes, I wondered if she still had 50 minutes of popcorn left.

In Rare Role Reversal, Mother Is Jailed for a Failure to Pay
The marriage went sour.
There was a divorce and custody fight and so much bitterness over child support that one spouse was jailed for not paying it.
What makes this tale unusual is that the person behind bars is a woman.
Denise Brousseau Reisner, a piano teacher from South Salem, N.Y., has been in the Westchester County Jail in Valhalla since July 13 for failing to comply with a court order that she pay support for the care of her four children, who are with her former husband, Murray Reisner of Armonk.

Johnson Takes a Shot at Reeves and the Giants' Coach Fires Back
In 14 years as a National Football League head coach, Dan Reeves has won at least 9 games in 10 of those seasons and at least 10 games eight times.
In the 1980's, he was the only coach to guide an American Football Conference team to back-to-back Super Bowls.
He may be one of the most prepared and diligent coaches in the N.F.L.
That is why so many people around the league think the Giants will win at least 10 games this season despite a difficult first five games.
However, if you believe the comments of the former Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson, Reeves didn't do such a good job tutoring quarterback Dave Brown last season.

He melded with it, learning to skate himself, to wear his pants tugged low to reveal the waistband of his undershorts, even designing his own skateboard.
Now, he has come to lunch at Barocco in black jeans and a black T-shirt that says "Powell Peralta," a skateboard maker with hip credentials on the street.


U.N. Tribunal Indicts Bosnian Serb Leader and a Commander
The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia indicted the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, today on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, a ruling that could complicate efforts to bring peace to the war-torn region.
The tribunal also indicted the commander of the Bosnian Serb military, Gen.
Ratko Mladic, as a war criminal.
The charges against both men include persecuting, shelling, killing and deporting civilians throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina; sniper attacks against civilians in Sarajevo, and taking United Nations peacekeepers hostage and using them as human shields.

Ally &amp; Gargano Plans Reorganization
After a series of large account losses, Ally &amp; Gargano, the New York agency founded in 1962, said yesterday that it would sell three divisions, dismiss half its employees and reorganize itself as a smaller, retail-oriented agency with a different name.
"It's necessary to reduce our overhead and pay our debts to be able of having any hope to go forward," said Bill Luceno, chairman and chief executive of Ally.
"We're doing what we can." He disputed a report in the Daily Fax edition of Advertising Age that said the agency would close.


Russian State TV Channel Says Let's Make a Deal
When the Russian Government decided to reorganize the vast and unprofitable state television network, the theft and corruption were so pervasive that the network called a four-month moratorium on all commercial advertising.
It was a staggering move that cost the cash-strapped network, Ostankino, tens of millions of dollars.
It was also a blow to advertising wholesalers, independent producers and network employees who were skimming millions of dollars a month.

Although the chairmen of CBS Inc. and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation continued to "grind away" yesterday at negotiations, as one person close to the talks said, few expected Westinghouse to make a bid for CBS as early as today.

But one investment banker who is not involved in the talks said Westinghouse's need to borrow the full $5 billion for a CBS purchase helped explain why the two sides had not yet announced an agreement.

Sperm Bank Gets a Temporary Reprieve
A sperm and blood bank that had been ordered by the New York State Health Department to close its doors by the end of business yesterday has won a temporary reprieve allowing it to keep operating until a panel of State Court of Appeals judges can hear more arguments in the case.
Judge Betty Weinberg Ellerin of the State Court of Appeals on Monday granted a request by the Daxor Corporation; its president, Dr.
Joseph Feldschuh, and several subsidiary companies that temporarily put on hold an order that the Health Department issued last week demanding that they cease operations.

Drama on a Scaffold High Above 3d Ave.
Two repairmen became the center of a life-and-death drama high above Manhattan yesterday when a fierce gust of wind smashed their scaffold through a window.
One man crawled through a broken window to the 22d floor, but the second dangled from a safety rope 20 floors above the sidewalk until a lawyer in the building, at 919 Third Avenue near 56th Street, rescued him.
"He crashed against the window a couple of times," said David Rosenthal, a lawyer at Shereff, Friedman, Hoffman &amp; Goodman.
As the man, Antonio Hernandez, 27, swayed back and forth, Mr.
Rosenthal looked for a chair to throw through the window, but decided he needed a heavier object.
He fetched a hammer and hit the window a few times.

Mindless Murder in Israel
Suicide bombers struck again in Israel this week, killing five Israelis on a suburban Tel Aviv bus and abruptly ending a three-month respite from large-scale terrorism.
The first reaction must be revulsion and outrage.
There can be no getting used to the scenes of innocent people horribly mangled, their bodies soaked in blood.
There can be no adequate answer to the grief and anger of their relatives and friends.
But there can be some consolation in the indications that Islamic terrorists are losing ground in their efforts to block a compromise peace between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
In important ways, the tide is turning against these enemies of peace.

Mets Have That Old Sinking Feeling
It was a 10-game road trip that figured to test the Mets' mental and physical character; an exhausting journey that carried them through five stops, three cities and two time zones.
When it began with three straight victories, there was a growing confidence that they had turned the corner and their best days were still ahead.
That feeling is gone.
The Mets are the Mets again, compiling defeat after defeat.
They lost their fifth straight game over all and their second extra-inning affair to the St.
Louis Cardinals in as many days today.
Relievers Doug Henry and Eric Gunderson combined on a pitiful performance that turned a hard-earned one-run lead in the 11th inning to a heart-wrenching 3-2 defeat.

Where to Find It
AS recently as the 1980's, shutters were almost ignored as window treatments.
More rickety than polished wood venetian blinds, less glamorous than billowy Roman shades and not nearly so theatrical as ruched silk curtains, shutters seemed to turn up mainly in dusty old brownstones and country houses in need of a face lift.
But in the lean, clean 90's, an era of sleek architectural interiors, shutters have become a window dressing of choice, for everything from vast expanses of glass to small bathroom windows.


DAVIDIANS' OFFER WAS SEEN AS RUSE
Two F.B.I. officials testified today that because they had viewed the Branch Davidian leader's final proposal for surrender as an empty delaying tactic, they had rejected it without consulting with the Justice Department.
The officials, testifying on the sixth day of House hearings on the Government's siege of the sect's compound, near Waco, Tex., also said they had gone forward with plans for the tear-gas operation that ended a 51-day standoff there without warning the Davidians that Federal agents had given up on negotiations.
The first warning came as tanks carrying the gas began rumbling toward the compound.

3 in World Trade Bombing Seek New Trial
Three of the four men convicted last year in the bombing of the World Trade Center argued in court yesterday that they had uncovered strong new evidence that would have changed the outcome of the trial.
But the trial judge immediately rejected their arguments, saying that the evidence was not new and was available to the original defense team.
Instead, the judge, Kevin Thomas Duffy of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said he would hold a hearing to determine whether the defendants' original lawyers were incompetent since they did not introduce the evidence at the trial.
"I'm telling you right now," Judge Duffy told the men's new lawyers, "I don't see anything new."

Ethereal Phrases on a Gritty Plain
Like some perverse mirage at the New York Philharmonic concert in Central Park on Tuesday evening, the image of Tanglewood kept bobbing to mind: listeners casually sprawled, perhaps picnicking, on an elegant, manicured lawn.
The Great Lawn of the park, in contrast, looked like a war zone, evidently denuded by the Disney screenings of "Pocahontas" last month.
Dirt loomed as far as the eye could see; if any scraps of grass remained, they must have been under the blankets of early arrivals.
Yet here, hunkering in the grit and sweltering in beastly heat and humidity, were 50,000 New Yorkers, by official estimates, some of them actually listening to the music.
An un likelier setting for the ethereal strains of Richard Strauss's "Rosenkavalier" could hardly be imagined.

Pay-Per-View Rivals Spar Over Two Heavyweight Bouts
Torrential rains obliterated HBO's plan to use Bryant Park in Manhattan yesterday to hype the third Evander Holyfield-Riddick Bowe bout on Nov. 4.
The soaked presentation ended abruptly with Rock Newman, Bowe's promoter, speaking into a microphone in a lightning storm.
But even while Holyfield and Bowe, now indoors, vowed to stage a memorable third fight, HBO remained a central character in an escalating scheduling controversy.
Holyfield-Bowe III is set to air on TVKO, HBO's pay-per-view unit, directly against the Mike Tyson-Brand X fight on Showtime's S.E.T. pay-per-view.

The decision, to be approved by the commission on Friday, will eliminate the one remaining uncertainty about the ability of the Australia-based News Corporation to retain control of the 12 stations that it owns or is in the process of acquiring.

Packwood's Legal Fund Shows Sharp Decline in Contributions
As pressure builds for public hearings on his case, contributions to Senator Bob Packwood's legal defense fund have dropped dramatically since the Senate Select Committee on Ethics determined in May that there was "substantial credible evidence" to support allegations of sexual and official misconduct against him.
From January 1993, when he started the defense fund, to last month, Senator Packwood, an Oregon Republican, collected $636,000, according to official records on file with the Senate.
In the 10 reporting quarters in that time, Mr.
Packwood collected a high of $157,700 from April to June 1993, and a low of $15,500 in the most recent reporting period, from last April to June.

DEFIANT SENATORS VOTE TO OVERRIDE BOSNIAN ARMS BAN
In a repudiation of President Clinton's policy on Bosnia, the Senate voted by a wide margin today to abandon American participation in the United Nations arms embargo against the war-ravaged nation.
The 69-29 vote came despite an intense lobbying campaign by the Administration that included visits to Capitol Hill by Cabinet members and last-minute telephone calls by Mr.
Clinton to wavering Democrats.
And it signaled the growing impotence and frustration of both Democrats and Republicans in the face of the brutal Bosnian Serb military attacks on United Nations-designated "safe areas."

Shuttle Safety Studied as O-Ring Concerns Resurface
The discovery of heat damage on a critical seal in rocket boosters for the last two space shuttle launchings has evoked somber memories of the Challenger explosion and will force space officials to decide soon whether it is safe to continue shuttle flights without change or whether they should be suspended for modifications.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said yesterday that post-flight analysis revealed that hot gas from burning rocket fuel left small singe marks on an O-ring seal on one of the two solid-fuel boosters used to launch the shuttle Discovery on July 13.

Gingrich Plays The Dealmaker On Budget Bills
Fearful that his majority might desert him on upcoming floor votes on two of the most important spending bills in the House, Speaker Newt Gingrich today struck deals with three discontented factions: moderates, conservatives and petulant freshmen.
Freshman Republicans and conservative Democrats who sought to hold his feet to the fire on balancing the budget won public agreement from Mr.
Gingrich to support a so-called "lock box" amendment to the bill that finances the Departments of Education, Labor and Health and Human Services, the largest of the 13 appropriations bills.
The provision is intended to insure that savings from future spending cuts would be used to reduce the Federal deficit, thus putting into law the promise of the budget resolution agreed to by the House and Senate earlier this year.

A curtain-raiser to the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals, which begin tomorrow in New Orleans, is the playoffs in the Grand National Teams.
This began at the grass-roots level in 25 districts nine months ago, and each has sent its champion team to New Orleans.

The same team, led by Jim Cayne of Manhattan, lost the district final 12 weeks ago by 45 imps.
The winners, who got themselves organized a few hours before the start, were Brian Glubok, Jim Rosenbloom, Mike Radin, all of Manhattan, and Fred Chang of Flushing, Queens.
For the playoffs, the Glubok foursome has recruited Zia Mahmood of Manhattan and Sam Lev of Forest Hills.

English Gardeners; A Cotswolds Refuge That Keeps the World at Bay
IT'S easy to get lost in the seven-acre garden at Westwell Manor, which unfolds from the doors of the 16th-century stone house in a maze of paths and hidden spaces, walled off from the outside world by stone and high hedges.
You might start out through the rose garden and end up in an orchard filmy with waist-high white cow parsley, or a round garden planted to catch the moonlight, wondering how you got there.
It has the richly textured effect of distinct rooms in a dream, in which you can't remember whether you took a right turn or a left.
An occasional gate or window in a hedge lets one peep out at the world.
But the overall feeling is of a world turning back upon itself.
These walls and enclosures hark back to medieval times, when the garden was a refuge, a place to escape the horrors of war and plague.

A Newspaper Battle Looms in San Diego Suburbs
What appears at first glance to be just another suburban newspaper merger could pose a considerable threat to this city's dominant paper, The San Diego Union-Tribune, by escalating a battle for readers and advertisers in the fastest-growing area of San Diego County.
The Tribune Company of Chicago said recently that it planned to sell its remaining newspaper holdings in Southern California to South Coast Newspapers Inc., a unit of Howard Publications, a privately held company based in Oceanside, Calif., that owns 18 newspapers in 12 states.

200 Years of House, 17 Years of Renovation
IN a splendid music room washed in moonlight from 10 grand and bull's-eye windows, under ceilings that soar to 15 feet, in this tidbit of early American history on a ridge overlooking the Potomac, guests sang "Happy Birthday" to John Dreyfuss.
But for Mr.
Dreyfuss, a 45-year-old Washington sculptor, it was just as much a celebration of the mansion that he has spent more than one-third of his life renovating.
The mansion, a 1783 Georgian jewel with a romantic and eccentric history, has for 17 years been a fascinating work in process for Mr.
Dreyfuss -- and has even longer held the fancy of Georgetowners.


It Isn't Too Late to Fight the Nynex Monopoly
On Friday, New York's Public Service Commission will approve a seven-year Nynex telephone rate and service plan.
The agreement, shaped in part by the company, will slightly lower telephone rates for consumers while allowing Nynex to keep excess revenues and pour profits into new communications services.
It is part of a sensible trend toward further deregulation of the Baby Bells.
But unless the commission monitors Nynex's performance and is willing to adjust the plan for changes in the market, the agreement is likely to hurt consumers and thwart competition.


Toru Kumon, Innovator, 81, In Math Studies
Toru Kumon, who was so dismayed when his 8-year-old son had trouble with second-grade math that he developed a streamlined teaching method now used by more than 2 million students in 29 countries, died on Tuesday at a hospital near his home in Osaka, Japan.
He was 81.
Mr.
Kumon was a high school math teacher in 1954 when his son Takeshi came home with a poor report card in arithmetic.
Prodded by his wife, he reviewed the child's textbook and was so appalled by what he found that he devised a back-to-basics home study program in which his son was required to complete one page of problems a day, progressing to a slightly higher level the next day.

He was King Chulalongkorn's youngest son by Queen Sawang -- one of three consorts carrying the title Queen -- but not the youngest son among 76 children fathered by the King.

Veba already controlled two companies in the west making similar products, and it closed the plant here, saying it was losing money.
The circuit-board machine is now for sale to anyone who will take it out of Germany, so that it does not compete with Veba.

Census Report Finds Hispanic Americans Lagging Further in College Degrees
At a time when many labor experts see a college degree as increasingly important to financial well-being, the percentage of Hispanic Americans who have one is falling farther behind that of non-Hispanic Americans who do, the Census Bureau said today.
In a new report, the bureau said that only 9 percent of Hispanic Americans 25 or older held bachelor's or advanced degrees in 1994, as against 24 percent of non-Hispanic Americans.
Back in 1970, the Hispanic figure was 5 percent, the non-Hispanic figure 11.6 percent.


Dayton Economic Message Mixed, Like Nation's
At the Voss Auto Network, which runs five dealerships in the Dayton area, cars are hardly moving.
Things are not much better at the cavernous BHA Piano Center here, where a weak dollar has sharply raised the price of the Japanese and South Korean models that increasingly dominate the market.
Sales of homes are below 1994 levels, and Roberds Furniture and Appliances, with a half-dozen stores in and around the city, has increased its advertising but has yet to reap any benefits.
Six months ago, the Dayton region was riding the crest of an industrial revival in the heartland that had driven down the unemployment rate to 3.6 percent.
But now, in the city where the Wright brothers created airplanes in bicycle shops and where John and Frank Patterson built the cash register industry, there are discouraging, if inconsistent, signs of a downturn.

Court Will Decide Future of Smoking Suit

Let Bosnia Defend Itself
The Senate and the Clinton Administration are headed in opposite directions on Bosnia.
The Senate approved by a veto-proof 69-to-29 margin yesterday a bill sponsored by Bob Dole and Joseph Lieberman scheduling an end to American compliance with the United Nations embargo on arms sales to Bosnia, a step that would speed the withdrawal of U.N. troops from that country.
Meanwhile, the Administration is pressing its European allies to widen the scope of a threatened NATO bombing campaign intended to keep the U.N. from withdrawing.
The Administration's desire to look forceful is understandable.
But the Senate's position is more in tune with the underlying realities, and American public opinion.
The way to restore coherence to American policy is for the Administration to change course and follow the Senate's lead.

They said the investigation, by the inspector general of the United States Information Agency, found that the director, Rolando Bonachea, sought to get rid of employees who alleged censorship, inaccurate and biased coverage and the hiring of unqualified staff members.

Heat and Humidity Bully New Yorkers With a Wet Blanket
The bad marriage of heat and humidity that for several days has made it feel as if it is over 100 degrees in the New York area pushed power consumption to near record levels yesterday, and showed no sign of abating.
An afternoon rainstorm briefly lowered the temperature, but brought high winds that slammed scaffolding, leaving two men dangling in Manhattan, and cut power lines to thousands of homes in Westchester County.
Although the reading in Central Park was only 90 degrees yesterday, the unusually high humidity, up to 70 percent even before the rain, made it feel like 102 degrees, meteorologists said.
The combination of stultifying humidity and temperatures hovering at 90 and above has continued almost uninterrupted for two weeks, turning a heat spell into a seeming eternity of sultriness, with the forecast calling for more of the same over the next few days.

Bang-Bang Play Shoots Down the Yankees' Streak
Over and over, the Yankees peered at the replay of the dramatic play that ended tonight's game.
Five times, 10 times, 15 times, they stared at Wally Joyner sliding across home plate.
In slow motion and at regular speed, they gazed intently as Jim Leyritz tagged Joyner's left shoulder.
Agonizingly, they saw the umpire, Dale Scott, rule that Joyner was safe to give the Royals a 6-5 victory.
Buck Showalter was bitter, Randy Velarde was frustrated, Leyritz was confused and Don Mattingly congratulated his son for booing the umpires.
The Yankees were stunned that they had squandered leads of 4-0 and 5-4, perturbed that their seven-game winning streak had died and angry that they might have eventually won if Joyner was called out.

House Bill Would Block New E.P.A. Pollution Rules
Just as the Environmental Protection Agency is about to issue its first comprehensive controls on toxic air pollution by the oil refining industry, the House of Representatives is preparing to vote on a measure forbidding enforcement of the rules.
It is one of the most striking reversals in pollution policy to be proposed as part of the regulatory rollback effort in Congress.
An entire industry would be exempted from regulations that others, like chemical plants, would still face under a law Congress passed by huge bipartisan margins just five years ago.
Because some oil refinery emissions are not only toxic but also cause smog, some communities might then have to impose other pollution controls if they are to meet national air quality standards and prevent asthma and other lung ailments.

Reclusive Couple and Son Are Found Dead in Home
Even by the reclusive standards of Hastings Street, there had always been something a little bit peculiar about the family in Apartment 22B.
It took at least a week, maybe even 10 days, after their deaths before neighbors noticed that Abraham Jacobs was not emerging every morning to buy groceries for his wife, Shirley, and their disabled adult son, Barry.
By the time the building superintendent, Leonard Walker, arrived on Tuesday, the stench of their badly decomposing bodies was so strong that he did not even venture into their upstairs apartment before calling the police.

In the latest assault on Western news organizations by the authoritarian Government of Singapore, the Supreme Court there ordered The International Herald Tribune today to pay libel damages of $678,000 to the country's top three leaders.
Judge Goh Joon Seng told the Paris-based newspaper to pay Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong the equivalent of about $250,000, and to pay former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and his son, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the equivalent of about $214,000 each.

Bantamweight Victory Turns Heads
Like any other 18-year-old, Carlos Navarro likes to eat, and who counts calories?
But unlike most his age, there are times when his weight is a big concern.
Navarro is an amateur boxer from Los Angeles, America's best bantamweight (119-pound limit) and a solid candidate for an Olympic medal next year in Atlanta.
But at the 1996 Summer Games, he expects to be fighting as a featherweight (125 pounds).

Jim Edmonds is a beanball incident waiting to happen, but, in the meantime, he continues to admire his home runs from ground zero.
The California Angels have first place to show for it, and Edmonds, who has absorbed everything the batting coach, Rod Carew, has showed him, suddenly finds himself a debonair center fielder.

3 Icons Exploring Life's Horrors and Joys
One might be forgiven for fearing the worst -- a little too much didacticism, an excess of uplift -- when faced with a production whose title means "to hear" or "to understand" in another language.
But Bill T. Jones, Toni Morrison and Max Roach skirted that and other pitfalls in "Degga," presented on Tuesday night at Alice Tully Hall as part of the American Visionaries series at Lincoln Center.
Essentially this was an evening spent with three icons of American culture, who hold among them two MacArthur grants, a Pulitzer and a Nobel Prize.
Luckily, the three are also artists of irresistible vitality, whose intensity as performers made for theater that was a voyage of discovery through a familiar landscape filled with unexpected crannies.
Mr.
Jones and Ms.
Morrison took hold of each other's hands to walk across the stage at several points during the hourlong piece.
That was the sensation of watching "Degga," named after a term from the Wolof language of Senegal, a journey guided by three pairs of strong hands and clear eyes.

Bosnia Troops Cite Gassings at Zepa
For 20 days, 850 Bosnian Government soldiers, some armed with little more than hunting rifles, crouched in their trenches, holding off the Bosnian Serb forces who had surrounded the town of Zepa.
While the world considered them vanquished, they braved the shelling that gutted much of Zepa, some of the Bosnian soldiers said today.
The small houses that survived the shelling were filled with wounded soldiers and civilians, dozens of whom died, they said.


U.N. Military Aides Given Right to Approve Attacks
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali agreed today to turn over his authority to veto or approve NATO air attacks in Bosnia to United Nations commanders in the field.
The move appeared to ease the way for rapid and large-scale attacks on the Bosnian Serbs if they threaten Gorazde, the protected enclave where Western allies have chosen to declare their stand against Serbian aggression.


2 House Democrats Offer a Compromise on Tobacco Regulation
Two Democratic Congressmen, one from a tobacco state, have proposed a plan that they say could curtail teen-age smoking without additional Federal regulation of tobacco.

"At the register, she held the envelope for us to take some money out of. We had to put the change into the envelope, because she refused to touch it."


More Aid Urged for Runaways
At least 13,000 New Jersey youths run away from home each year, a private nonprofit group said yesterday.

Simpson Team Says Witness Turns Hostile
Lawyers for O. J. Simpson today accused one of their own witnesses, an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, of making his testimony more pro-prosecutorial after huddling with Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark and her colleagues during a court break on Tuesday.
Questioned early that day, the agent, Roger Martz of the bureau's chemical toxicological unit, said his tests on a bloody sock and a blood smear on a metal gate behind the house of Mr.
Simpson's former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, suggested the presence of a chemical preservative.
That point is crucial to the defense, which contends that police officers planted blood linking Mr.
Simpson to the murders of his former wife and her friend Ronald L. Goldman.

The record sold 331,000 copies, according to Soundscan, a company in Hartsdale, N.Y., that tracks music retail sales, becoming the first album by a Latin artist to reach No. 1 on the pop charts.
On July 18, the day it was released, "Dreaming of You" had already sold more than 175,000 copies to become the fastest-selling album ever by a woman.

Municipal Bond Regulation Debated at House Hearing
In the aftermath of the financial debacle in Orange County, Calif., Congress began asking today whether greater financial disclosure was needed in the municipal bond market to prevent similar catastrophes.

Currents; Building Residences for Teen-Agers in Need
HOW to build a successful residence for teen-agers who are troubled or have no parents?
Create a place with a collegial, homelike feel, "where kids can feel good about themselves," said James Campbell, the executive director of Leake &amp; Watts Services of Yonkers, a 164-year-old nonprofit social services agency.
More than 100 young people, ages 13 to 18, live in Yonkers on the agency's bucolic 30 acres, landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted.
Recently, the agency allocated $40 million to design and construct 13 new buildings, including a new school and nine cottages, each to house only 14 teen-agers during a typical two-year-long stay.
Inspired by memories of summer camp, the architect, Richard Dattner, visited the teen-agers in their old residences, then devised two-story, Prairie-style brick dormitories with shingled roofs and skylight cupolas (with weather vanes) that flood the rooms with cheerful light.

Brooklyn Woman Is Charged in Beating Death of Her Daughter, 3
A mother who lived with her husband and four young daughters in a cramped, subdivided Brooklyn apartment was charged with murder yesterday in the beating death of one of the children, a 3-year-old girl named Gabriella, who the police said bore the bruises of continual abuse.
The parents, Sara Munoz and Gilberto Vasquez, were illegal immigrants who came from Mexico several years ago, the police said.
They found their way to Sunset Park, where many poor immigrant families live in illegally divided apartments and work in local factories and sweatshops.


Cost of 'Quiet on Set' Is Escalating
In his seven years as a location manager in the film industry, Patrick McIntire has rented noisy chain saws just so he could turn them off and paid lawn crews to stop clacking their shears and revving their leaf-blowers.
Loud radios, barking dogs and immovable people have cost him a bundle.
Mr.
McIntire is not alone.
In Los Angeles and other California areas popular for filming, residents are sometimes making thousands of dollars from movie crews by promising to vacate outdoor sets, tone down noise or otherwise stop harassing them.
The problem has become so acute that the State Legislature has stepped in, drafting laws to make harassing film crews for profit a criminal offense.


T.R.A. Commissioner Faces Revived Threat

But its control has been shaken in the last year since it hired McGrath, a television and marketing executive, to serve as its first commissioner.

Researchers have discovered what they hope will be a magic bullet for obesity, or at least the forerunner of major new therapies: a hormone that makes overweight animals rapidly lose body fat.
The hormone is particularly impressive because it can make even lean animals shed almost all of what little fat they have.
The finding, which will be published tomorrow in three papers in the journal Science, has been greeted with great enthusiasm by scientists who see it as presenting a powerful new approach to treating obesity.

TB Case Linked to Infection of 45 at Bar
For months, a 48-year-old regular at a neighborhood bar in Minneapolis had a cough that worsened.
He breathed more than twice as fast as usual, felt feverish, became progressively weaker, lost 65 pounds.
As the man became sicker, he spent more time at the bar, slept under a bridge, in shelters and occasionally in a rooming house near the bar.
But he did not go to a doctor and no one sent him to a public clinic six blocks from the bar.
Finally, he went to a nearby hospital, where doctors diagnosed tuberculosis.

Gerry Adams, the political leader of the Irish Republican Army, today gingerly accepted the idea that an international commission to arrange the disarmament of the I.R.A. might lead to the start of full-fledged negotiations toward a political settlement of its 25-year fight against British rule.
The Irish and British Governments have said they are considering proposing such a commission to clear the way for talks involving both governments with Sinn Fein, the I.R.A. political wing, and Protestant Unionist parties.
The Protestant parties and the British Government have refused to sit down with Sinn Fein until the process of disarming the I.R.A. has begun.


Market Place; Viacom shows there's always a way to avoid capital-gains taxes.
SHREWD corporations and their lawyers have lots of ways to reduce their tax bills, a fact demonstrated in Viacom Inc.'s latest deal to sell its cable television systems to Tele-Communications Inc.

Over time, Viacom will pay less in taxes than it would have under the first deal.
But Tele-Communications will pay more in taxes.

With the Bible in one hand and the telephone he answered on the first ring in the other, Darryl Strawberry was waiting in a hotel in Norfolk, Va., today for the call that would finally send him to the Yankees and back to the major leagues.
Strawberry's wait will continue, though, because George Steinbrenner has told associates he is enraged at Bill Goodstein, the player's agent, for trying to manipulate the timing of Strawberry's being summoned from Class AAA and for intimating that the Yankee owner had lost the negotiation process.

Global Grass-Roots Banking
The World Bank, the Agency for International Development and eight other donors have joined to finance small loans to the poorest of the world's poor -- loans as little as $100, at low interest rates and with no collateral except the borrower's word.
These will be loans to underwrite the aspirations of ordinary people, from funds provided by international agencies accustomed to dealing in tens and hundreds of millions, with a level of caring not routinely shown by even a generous local banker.
"Like slavery in the 19th century, the fact that 700 million human beings are hungry in the 20th century is unconscionable," says Ismail Serageldin, a vice president of the World Bank and chairman of the new aid group.
"We are the new abolitionists."

Behind Truman's Decision on the Atomic Bomb
Peter Jennings begins tonight's review of President Harry S. Truman's decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan with these questions: "Did it shorten the war? Did it save American lives? Was it necessary?" The answer to all of them, rendered by a huddle of historians, is most likely not.
This cogently argued contribution to revisionist history takes particular aim at Truman for what it charges were his own attempts at revisionism, cooking up reasons after the fact for the demolishment of Hiroshima and then Nagasaki that omitted or concealed much of what actually went into the decision.

Restaurants
At this time of year I find myself ordering pasta with plain tomato sauce whenever I can.
Made with good, fresh tomatoes and a sprinkling of basil, it is perfect summertime fare.
But why is it so hard to find it done well in a restaurant?
I thought about that on my final visit to Novita.
Sitting in that small, elegant room, appreciating the deep yellow walls and hand-blown Venetian sconces, I couldn't help wishing that the food had the stark simplicity of the decor.
Certainly everything about the room is appealing, from the clean lines to the pleasant, caring service.
Novita is a family affair.
The owners are Marco Fregonese, who is also the chef; his wife, Elizabeth Yoshida, and her sister Gina.
The two women are as elegant and beautiful as the decor, and they seem committed to the idea of making you comfortable.
One night I watched them pull two chairs together to make a bed for a small, sleepy patron.
Another night they bustled around rearranging tables to accommodate an awkwardly large family party.
And one afternoon, Gina Yoshida helped an older woman negotiate the steps to the sidewalk with great solicitude.

Romancing The Swan
IN "An Uncertain Hour," the choreographer Martha Clarke's latest work for Netherlands Dance Theater 3, women in evening gowns and men in hats and suits wander amid a rocky landscape, trying to make emotional contact.
Communication is not their forte.
It all has the feel of a movie by Michelangelo Antonioni.
Or so it seems until a woman simulates sex with a stuffed swan that was previously involved with one of the men, who acts as its handler.
In those images, all outside references -- even those of the mythic Leda and her Swan -- fade away and the piece becomes, momentarily and wonderfully, pure Martha Clarke: the performance suddenly assumes the pungency of her uninhibited brand of dance-theater.
Outrageousness combines with poignancy, and bold insight is married to the beautiful visual image.
The more distilled the movement, the more intense the emotional impact.
Again, as is common in her work, Martha Clarke at her wackiest is Martha Clarke at her best.

The evidence is clear that (1) higher speed limits lead to higher travel speeds; (2) higher travel speeds lead to increased crash risks, and (3) when a crash occurs, the higher the travel speed, the greater risk of death.

Also of Note
Critics' choices of some other Manhattan gallery shows:  "A BENEFIT EXHIBITION FOR D.E.A.F. INC.," Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery, 51 Greene Street, SoHo, (through today).
This show, organized by Jeff Koons, is a hodgepodge of familiar names, but the installation by Joseph Grigely is worth a visit.
The lawn furniture, beer cans and cherry pits look like the aftermath of a summer party, and the dozens of handwritten notes scattered across the table are the remains of extended conversations between Mr.
Grigely, who is deaf, and friends (Holland Cotter).


Aquatic Armageddon With Plenty of Toys
THE torrent of loose talk that ushers in "Waterworld," the most wasteful feat of one-upmanship in Hollywood history, threatens to drown out the movie itself.
How can a made-up tale of rivalry and opportunism beat the backstage melodrama of bringing "Waterworld" to the screen?
Afloat on a sea of production crises, the makers of this madly inflated action film have been held accountable for just about every imaginable sin.
The melting of the polar ice cap, which sets the film's story in motion, is one of the few relevant calamities for which they have not been blamed.
What was the point of this hubris-filled exercise?
Finally we know.
Directed by Kevin Reynolds, "Waterworld" is a big, brawny, overzealously bizarre epic punctuated by daring action scenes, which are sloppily assembled (the sky or ocean color seldom matches in any two consecutive scenes) but still exciting.
It goes slack between taunts and explosions.

U.S. DETAINS ARAB TIED TO MILITANTS
United States officials have taken into custody a Palestinian they say is one of the senior leaders of Hamas, the militant Islamic group that has claimed responsibility for recent bombings in Israel, Attorney General Janet Reno said today.
Immigration officials said they detained the Palestinian, Mousa Mohamed Abu Marzook, at Kennedy Airport in New York on Tuesday as he was arriving from abroad because he was on a terrorist watch list.
Mr.
Marzook, who American and Israeli authorities say is the head of Hamas's political committee, is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.


To Local Union Leaders, A Merger Means Power
When people active in the union movement digested today's news about the merger of the nation's steel workers, automobile workers and machinists, their surprise was quickly replaced by the view that preserving old identities -- and perhaps their jobs as union officials -- is a poor substitute for the bargaining power they believe will come with more consolidation.
"I knew we had been talking to others about closer ties but I was stunned by this like everyone else," said Mike Mezo, president of Local 1010, the steelworkers' unit representing more than 15,000 current and former employees of Inland Steel Industries' sprawling mill complex here at the southwest corner of Lake Michigan.
"My next thought was: It's about time."

The company's operating cash flow -- as defined by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization -- increased 36 percent from the 1994 quarter, to $595 million, well ahead of analysts' expectations.
"It was a much better quarter" than expected, said Keith Benjamin, an analyst at Robertson Stephens &amp; Company.

The bill is expected to be adopted on Friday, but not before battles to legitimize the charity sports trips and an effort by Republican leaders to raise the limits on permissible gifts.

Paine Webber Inc., one of the country's largest retail brokerage firms, said yesterday that it was taking a $200 million pretax charge in the second quarter to cover the costs of settling lawsuits arising from its sales of limited partnerships in the mid-1980's.
The one-time charge, which Paine Webber expects will cover the costs of paying fines levied by the Securities and Exchange Commission and lawsuits of individual investors, caused the firm to report a loss for the second quarter of $90.5 million.


War in Korea, Fast Receding, Gets Memorial
Under a sweltering sun worlds away from the cold war combat being commemorated, President Clinton and President Kim Young-sam of South Korea dedicated a new national memorial today intended to assure that the long-gone Korean War does not remain forgotten.
"The Korean War veterans endured terrible hardships: deathly cold, weeks and months crammed in foxholes and bunkers, an enemy of overwhelming numbers, the threat of brutal imprisonment and torture," Mr.
Clinton said of a conflict in which more than 54,000 Americans died, but which has faded in the public mind between the triumphs of World War II and the turmoil of Vietnam.
"They set a standard of courage that may be equaled but never surpassed in the annals of American combat."

The Senate Takes Time Out to Celebrate an Old-Timer's 14,000th Vote
Senators of both parties laid down their arms briefly today to commend Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, for casting his 14,000th vote.
It seemed a quaint exercise, given that Mr.
Byrd had long ago broken the most-votes record, held by Senator William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin, when he cast his 12,134th vote on April 27, 1990.
The Senate will be planning a similar citation for Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, who is only 34 votes behind Mr.
Byrd.


Market Place; A Bit of Insurance, a Lot of Stock Picking
Would you like to double your money every three years?
The Securities and Exchange Commission will not allow companies to sell stock on that promise, but that is the unstated lure for a proposed stock offering of Normandy America, a new company headed by a 30-year-old money manager with an astounding 10-year record.
Normandy America is one of two new companies -- Risk Capital Re is the other -- with pending stock offerings and similar business plans.
Both companies are in the insurance business but make no bones about their strategy of doing a little bit of insurance and lot of investing in the stocks of other companies.
Normandy America presents itself as a stock picker extraordinaire, while Risk Capital plans to concentrate on investments in the insurance business.


Overall Crime Rate Drops by 3% For State, Trenton Report Shows
All kinds of crime were down in New Jersey in 1994, the only across-the-board decline since uniform crime reports were first compiled for the state in 1967.
The overall drop was 3 percent when compared with 1993.
That decline matches the national average but lags behind the Northeast region, where the drop was 5 percent.


Port Agency Trims Budget And Its Scope
Under pressure from the governors who oversee it, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has begun a round of budget cuts that appear to be a prelude to more drastic steps, indicating that the agency may soon be forced to scale back its historical role as a power in the region's economic development.
The authority's new executive director, George J. Marlin, has moved forward in recent weeks on his mandate to trim its work force and costs by ordering a hiring freeze and reductions in travel and other expenses.
Yesterday, the authority's board began examining the first results of a study on how the agency can reduce its spending by eliminating some jobs.


New Tick Disease Almost Claims Surgeon
A surgeon from Rockland County nearly died in intensive care last month at a Manhattan hospital, and blood tests have found that he was suffering from two tick-borne infections, the all-too-familiar Lyme disease and a sometimes lethal illness caused by a newly identified bacterium, his doctors say.
The case, the first in Rockland County involving the new bacterium, is the most serious instance of tick-transmitted illness reported in New York State this year, state health officials said.

A Joining of Three Varied Old Warriors
Putting to rest the once-fierce division in labor ranks that time has made irrelevant, a merger of the auto workers, the steel workers and the machinists, if it takes place, will unite three still powerful if diminished unions with colorful, varied histories.
The steel and auto unions were formed during the Depression-driven rush to organize entire industries in the 1930's; the machinists, in contrast, trace their roots to the last century, when highly skilled mechanics who kept the railroads running organized themselves along craft lines.


International Briefs; Spanish Cable TV Deal
The Spanish state-controlled telecommunications company Telefonica de Espana S. A. has signed an agreement with the TV station Canal Plus to operate and distribute pay television and multimedia through cable TV networks.
The business plan will be presented in the first two weeks of September.
The agreement covers all of Spain, although it will be based initially on pilot projects in Madrid and Barcelona.
The service will be operated by Cablevision, a company in which the two groups hold 66.6 percent.
Other companies with experience in cable TV and multimedia will be invited to participate. (Reuters)


How Some Foreign Art Got to U.S. and Britain
"Seekers of the Lost Treasure" is a four-parter about some 19th- and 20th-century adventurers who plucked notable collections of art and artifacts from other lands to enrich the museums of Britain and the United States.
The programs all rely on re-creations, which, along with the Hollywood spin-off of a title, lend them a fictional quality.
But how else is a producer to make up for the lack of a movie camera at the scene?
"The Michael Rockefeller Story," the first part of Sunday's opening two hours, tells of that young man's art-collecting journey to Dutch New Guinea, which ended with his much publicized disappearance in 1961.
Speaking of publicity, at moments Jeremy Irons's upscale narration sounds like a Rockefeller production: "Rockefeller fantasies did not remain fantasies for long."

New Jobs, But Low-Paid
New Jersey will gain nearly as many new jobs this year as last year (1.6 percent, compared with 1.7 percent), despite the continuing loss of manufacturing jobs, economic forecasters from Rutgers University said yesterday.

ANTONINA TUMKOVSKY will turn 90 next month, so on Wednesday the School of American Ballet, where she has taught since 1949, took the occasion to congratulate her with Champagne and cake. (The school will not be in session on her actual birthday, Aug. 21.)
Mme.
Tumkovsky, as she is universally known, still teaches 13 hours of classical ballet a week at the school, which is the academy for the New York City Ballet.
Her students there have included Patricia McBride, Suzanne Farrell and Darci Kistler.
She has a reputation for being such a tough teacher that she is known as "The Tuminator."

Now, he says his assets are worth less than the $3.4 billion he owes the banks.


Columbus Shuttle Still in Holding Pattern
The wait continued for Darryl Strawberry, the punishment continued toward Bill Goodstein, and George Steinbrenner wanted everyone to believe that his refusal to promote the former Met from Class AAA Columbus was strictly a baseball decision.
While the Players Association considered whether to file a grievance on Strawberry's behalf because of Steinbrenner's hesitance to recall him, the 33-year-old outfielder with the solid statistics for Columbus was prepared to toil over the next four days in Scranton, Pa.
The Metrodome, where the Yankees open a three-game series Friday against the Twins, looked far away to Strawberry.
One club official said Strawberry will not join the Yankees on this road trip, which ends in Minnesota.

Simpson Defense Advances Police-Conspiracy Theory
Lawyers for O. J. Simpson today began a three-pronged effort to prove a conspiracy by the police to frame their client, arguing that rogue officers planted blood on a sock, planted a bloody glove behind Mr.
Simpson's house and planted rigged laboratory test results with the press.
The defense advanced the first prong in testimony, with their blood-splatter expert stating that blood on the sock found at the foot of Mr.
Simpson's bed had got there by touch rather than by splatter and that some of that blood had seeped through, something that could not have happened had Mr.
Simpson been wearing it at the time.

Report Offers New Tactics For E.M.S.
In a report issued yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani recommended a series of changes at the Police Department and at the Emergency Medical Service to avoid the kind of miscommunication that led to a 35-minute delay in dispatching an ambulance to aid gunshot victims at a shootout in Rego Park, Queens, in December.
Both departments were criticized after the Dec. 18 shootout, in which police fired 247 shots during a four-block pursuit of a disgruntled tenant who killed his two landlords and wounded a bystander, later killed by police fire.
Four other people were wounded.
Victims' repeated calls to 911 resulted in E.M.S.'s confusion and delay.

Westinghouse and CBS May Soon Vote on Deal
The Westinghouse Electric Corporation and CBS Inc. have tentatively scheduled meetings of their boards next week to vote on Westinghouse's cash bid to buy CBS at $81 a share, according to several people with knowledge of the negotiations.
But even if a Westinghouse buyout of CBS is approved, there will still be months when another bidder could challenge that bid.
According to one investment banker who specializes in media, the $5 billion deal could not close until Westinghouse actually paid for the CBS shares.
Westinghouse could not do that until the Federal Communications Commission approved the transfer of its television and radio station licenses, a process that could take months, giving any rivals ample time to put together their bids.


Giants Rich in Talent For the Running Game
Rodney Hampton worked out almost every day in Houston during the off season and showed up for training camp in the best shape of his career.
Gary Downs is hungry and so far may have had the best camp of any Giants player.
Herschel Walker is 33 years old and still outran half the defense during a Tuesday scrimmage.
Tyrone Wheatley, expected to arrive in camp soon, was an all-American at Michigan.
This is just part of the Giants' backfield, which is talented, big and crowded.
There are nine running backs/fullbacks on the roster, and the Giants will probably keep only five.
Walker, Hampton and Wheatley are sure to make it.
That leaves six players competing for the two remaining spots.

A Silent-Film Femme Fatale As Victim, Too
The most remarkable thing about G. W. Pabst's 1928 silent-film masterpiece "Pandora's Box" is Louise Brooks's thoroughly modern portrayal of Lulu, a showgirl and prostitute whose downfall culminates in an encounter with Jack the Ripper.
Adapted from Frank Wedekind's play "Pandora's Box," which was the basis of Alban Berg's opera "Lulu," the movie paints its central character as an ambiguous femme fatale, as much victim as destroyer.
As she drifts from lover to lover (they include a stuffy editor who commits suicide and his son, a compulsive gambler), Lulu remains unaware of the devastating erotic charisma that she beams at every man who crosses her path.


Australian Doctors Get Right to Assist Suicide
Because of the pencil-thin green oxygen tubes that snake across his kitchen floor, Lloyd Nickson can rarely risk leaving his small apartment.
His lungs are thick with scar tissue from pulmonary fibrosis, so it is a never-ending struggle to drag enough oxygen into his diseased chest.
Still, he did force himself out of the apartment this year -- to lobby his neighbors in Darwin, Australia's northernmost city, the gateway to the parched red soil of the outback, for passage of a bill that would allow his doctors to help him die.

The bullpen was finally putting out fires instead of igniting them, and third base was no longer a burial ground for stranded Met base runners.
Winning six of their first seven games made them one of the hottest teams in baseball.

Clinton and the Economy; Even if Growth Rebounds, the President May Not Win Comparable Political Gains
On Friday morning, the Commerce Department will issue a figure that until very recently the White House was dreading: an accounting of the economy's paltry growth in the second quarter of the year, a grim statistic that for much of the year looked as if it would be the first step off a steep cliff.
The number will likely be around five-tenths of a percent, a long, long fall from the economy's spectacular performance last year.
But now there is a growing consensus among economists and traders that the figure will likely be the year's worst and that a rebound is already under way.

F.C.C. Is Ordered to Delay an Auction for Wireless Licenses
For the second time in four months, a Federal appeals court here has blocked the Government from its plan to reserve a block of wireless telephone licenses for small businesses.
Responding to complaints raised by a small New York company, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia today ordered the Federal Communications Commission to delay an auction for the licenses that had been scheduled to start on Aug. 29.


Union Files Complaint Over Fees
The Communications Workers of America, a union that represents 34,000 state workers, says the Whitman administration is illegally holding back money that rightfully belongs to the union, to coerce members to accept a new contract.
The disputed sum -- about $270,000 a month -- is the amount the union usually collects from the 9,000 state workers who do not choose to be members.


About Real Estate; Agents Say Home Sales Remain in the Doldrums
As the summer doldrums settle in, real estate agents across the metropolitan New York region are hoping for cooler weather -- and more sales.
With the exceptions of small bustling pockets of good business and a few agents who insist that this is one of their best seasons ever, the spring and the months of June and July have left many agents glum.

For a race called the Screen King, this one had a smash ending.
Mr.
Greeley, trained by Nick Zito, was the 3-5 favorite and had never lost at six furlongs.
Lord Carson, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, was the second choice and led all the way until they were 100 yards from home.
And then there was the long shot, Kings Fiction, trained by Allen Jerkens, who was running last with a quarter of a mile to go.


Diner's Journal
Asian Appetizers
If you like to be startled when you eat, you'll probably like Silk, an Asian-fusion restaurant on Third Avenue.
It looks like a slightly fancy Chinese restaurant, at least until the menu arrives.
But when you open it up, you find that every dish is out of the ordinary.
Consider the crispy seafood dumplings with cucumber salad in Sichuan peppercorn sauce.
The "dumplings" are big curls that crackle when you take a bite, then give way to the softness of seafood.
The texture is echoed by the sharpness of the sauce so that eating the appetizer is an entirely satisfying experience.


A Delicate Asian Flower In a Motorcycle Jacket
When Jade Li (Sandra Oh), a young Chinese-Canadian woman, is approached by a handsome white stranger, she plays the shy flower.
She smiles, blushes, covers her mouth and casts her eyes downward, acting the perfect picture of Asian daintiness.
But for Jade, the heroine of Mina Shum's wry and winning "Double Happiness," this is a cosmic joke.
And Mark (Callum Rennie) really should have known better.
He should have noticed that this little lotus blossom was wearing a black leather motorcycle jacket, standing outside a nightclub.


New Finance Decontrol Bill From G.O.P.
Republicans on the House Commerce Committee announced plans today for a broad review of American securities laws, beginning with hearings in September.
Representative Jack Fields, the Texas Republican who heads the Commerce Committee panel that will start the review, introduced a draft bill today that would rewrite many laws that have stood unchanged since the 1930's.
He proposed to move many regulatory functions from the states to the Federal Government, limit brokers' liability in lawsuits by institutional investors, end some curbs on mergers and acquisitions and relax rules that require that investors be given prospectuses before buying stock in initial public offerings.


Congressional Roundup; Gingrich Tells Ethics Panel About His Deal for Book
Speaker Newt Gingrich testified in private before the House ethics committee about his book deal today, but the senior Democrat on the panel demanded that he come back again and said the committee's sloppy procedures invited the charge of cover-up.
The Democrat, Representative Jim McDermott of Washington, said he and other committee members were "totally unprepared" to question Mr.
Gingrich because of inadequate staffing and too little time to prepare.


Bank's Chief Resigns After Failed Deals
In a surprise move, the chairman and chief executive of the Bank of Boston Corporation, Ira Stepanian, quit last night after an all-day board meeting.
The board promoted the bank's president, Charles K. Gifford, to replace Mr. Stepanian.
The shake-up follows the embarrassing collapse of a deal to merge with Corestates Financial of Philadelphia.
The proposed deal, which was called off on Saturday night, was sharply criticized by investors and divided the board.
Some analysts saw Mr.
Stepanian's resignation as a result of his insistence on keeping the company independent.


Dentist Charged in Sexual Abuse Of a Sedated Female Patient
A Manhattan dentist was charged yesterday with sexually abusing a patient while she was sedated during a bridgework procedure.
David Molho, a 58-year-old dentist who lives with his wife and two children in Scarsdale, N.Y., was arrested at his office on East 58th Street for sexually groping the patient and forcing her to touch him while she was sedated with nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, the authorities said.

War Turns Sarajevo Away From Europe
With faith in the West extinguished, an outgunned army on the defensive and most of the capital's intellectuals and professionals in exile, this city is turning away from a cosmopolitan European past and embracing a nationalism built on religious identity and indifference to its tradition of artistic and cultural wealth.
"The people in Bosnia feel betrayed by the Western international community," said Tarik Kupusovic, the Mayor of Sarajevo.
"All the promises that have been made by the West, after all, have never been fulfilled. People are beginning to look at Europe, and themselves, differently."


Doubt Recalled on Using Gas at Waco Siege
A top F.B.I. official testified today at Congressional hearings on the raid on the Branch Davidian compound that he did not realize that the on-scene commander had concluded that a tear-gas operation proposed for gradually ending the siege near Waco, Tex., was almost certain to escalate quickly into a broad assault.
The official, Larry A. Potts, also testified today that from the start he had doubts about the plan to use gas.
At the time of the siege, Mr.
Potts was the head of the agency's criminal division and the official in Washington with overall responsibility for action against the sect.

The Paradoxes of Chinese Porcelain Motifs
In Chinese art, something new often turns out to be something old, reclaimed and transformed.
And images that to the casual eye appear genial and carefree can be coded emblems of discontentment and nostalgia.
Such is the message conveyed by "Chinese Porcelains of the 17th Century: Landscapes, Scholars' Motifs and Narratives," organized by Julia B. Curtis at China Institute.
Many of the 65 jars and bowls on view are virtuoso examples of the craftsman's art.
But as the exhibition and its informative catalogue suggest, they are also subtle indicators of political upheaval.


Giuliani Orders a Study on Two Airports
Criticizing the Port Authority's stewardship of the two New York City airports, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday commissioned a study on the future of the airports as a first step toward possibly bringing them under city control.
Mr.
Giuliani said Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports were lagging behind Newark and other major gateways in preparing for the future of air travel and said it was time the city made its own decisions on how to improve airport facilities and access.


Keep the Water System
After weeks of haggling, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has failed to persuade the City Comptroller, Alan Hevesi, to approve the sale of New York City's water system for an infusion of budget funds.
Now Mr.
Giuliani says he will take Mr.
Hevesi to court.
The legal issues are complicated and subject to differing interpretations.
But we continue to believe that it would be unwise public policy for the city to sell a vast and valuable asset to pay for construction projects over the next four years.
As originally proposed in Mr.
Giuliani's budget, the city would transfer ownership of its network of reservoirs, pipelines and sewers to another government entity, the New York City Water Board.
Part of the proceeds from the sale would be used to retire existing city debt, and $1 billion would pay for capital improvements, including $200 million this year for schools alone.

We Won't Get Far Without Affirmative Action; Not a Recompense
To the Editor:
Andrew Sullivan (Op-Ed, July 23) is right on some points.
The criteria for affirmative action should not be racial.
There is no valid reason for giving the children of black or Hispanic (not to mention Asian) academics or business executives or upper-echelon government officials or high-ranking military officers preference in hiring or admission to postsecondary education over those of working-class whites.

Rich Get Richer: Angels Land Abbott; Indians Add Hill
While the Yankees continue their pursuit of David Cone, two American League division leaders have added established pitchers to their starting rotations.
The Cleveland Indians yesterday grabbed Ken Hill from the St.
Louis Cardinals, and a few hours later the California Angels reacquired Jim Abbott from the Chicago White Sox.
The Indians and the Angels, with the league's best records, look like they should have no trouble winning division championships, but they traded for the pitchers to bolster their chances in the playoffs, where they would play each other in the first tier of games.

G.O.P. Lawmakers Offer a Ban On Federal Affirmative Action
A group of Congressional Republicans led by Senator Bob Dole, the front-running candidate for the party's Presidential nomination, today introduced legislation that would effectively bar the Federal Government from granting any benefits on the basis of race, ethnicity or sex.
Sponsors of the bill, offered only a week after President Clinton's ringing endorsement of affirmative action, said it would not come up for a vote until next year, a schedule that would inject the divisive issue of race- and sex-based preferences into the campaign for the White House.

They are supervised by H.R.A. personnel, who also have the power to fire them.

And considering what they are paid, they might as well be on welfare themselves.


Mixed-Species Organ Is Set for Transplant
An organ that is a combination of animal and human genetic material will be transplanted to a human for the first time within the next month, researchers announced today.
Experiments with these mixed-species organs, called transgenic organs, were granted clearance by the Food and Drug Administration last week and are aimed at developing two new medical technologies: the use of animal organs outside the human body, where they would act much like dialysis machines, and the use of animal organs for direct transplant into humans to replace organs that have failed.


Board Says 2 Officers Used Excessive Force on Suspects
The Civilian Complaint Review Board has determined that two Bronx detectives used unnecessary and excessive force when they fired 22 bullets into three young robbery suspects, killing two and injuring the other, officials said yesterday.
Although officials refused to disclose the details of their findings, one person familiar with the board's work said that the two detectives were not in danger when the shots were fired and that all of the bullets were fired from behind the victims.

Twelve men suspected of having ties to organized crime were arrested yesterday in New Jersey and New York after a 10-month investigation by the State Attorney General's office and the State Police, The Associated Press reported.
Evidence against the men was gathered in tape recordings made by an informant and an undercover agent who infiltrated the Lucchese crime family in northern New Jersey, said Robert T. Buccino, who headed the investigation.


Senator Grassley's Surf Police
An academic study suggesting that the Internet is awash in bestiality, pedophilia and other kinky sex turns out to have been seriously flawed.
Politicians like Senator Charles Grassley who waved the study around as an argument for intrusive regulation have stopped doing so.
But Mr.
Grassley and his allies have not backed off from their drive to draft unnecessary legislative restrictions on computer communications.
Earlier this summer, Senator James Exon attached an amendment to the Senate version of a telecommunications bill that would impose Federal penalties on those who made available material deemed unsuitable for children.
The unreliable study that did much to spur this bad legislating was conducted by Marty Rimm, then an undergraduate at Carnegie-Mellon University.
It was reprinted in the Georgetown Law Journal and served as the basis for a credulous Time magazine article early this month.
Mr.
Rimm's academic supervisors have since made clear that the study had serious defects.
The likelihood that children will be accidentally deluged with sexually charged computer graphics is much smaller than Mr.
Rimm and his promoters suggested.

International Briefs; Ricoh Bid for Gestetner
Gestetner Holdings P.L.C., a British distributor of office automation equipment, said yesterday that it had received a takeover bid of $:179 million, or about $286 million, from the Ricoh Company of Japan.
Ricoh, which makes photocopiers and other office equipment, said two weeks ago that it was mulling over the offer for London-based Gestetner.
Ricoh already owns more than 28 percent of Gestetner's stock, but also has an agreement to buy another 15 percent holding from Inchcape P.L.C., a British marketing and business-services company.SQN####(Dow Jones)

The London-based chemical, paint and explosives concern said profits from its industrial chemicals division soared from the first half of 1994, because of lower costs and higher selling prices.
Imperial's six-month pretax profit was $:510 million, or $812.6 million, compared with $:234 million a year earlier.
Sales were $:5.1 billion, or $8.13 billion, up 14 percent from $:4.5 billion last year. (Dow Jones)

Tiny Foot Bones May Show A Giant Leap for Mankind
Footprints preserved in volcanic ash show that human ancestors in Africa were walking upright as early as 3.7 million years ago, making this behavior one of their first and most distinctive departures from all other primates.
But was walking the only way these protohumans got about?
Were they still climbing trees, in the manner of chimpanzees, for safety, sleeping and gathering fruits and nuts?
These questions have long puzzled and divided anthropologists studying crucial evolutionary changes in the early hominids, or human forerunners, after their divergence from the apes.
Now the discovery of four foot bones in South Africa has produced the best fossil evidence yet for how the ancestors of modern man moved about, and may yield compelling answers or simply rekindle the flames of old debates.


Unabating Heat Wave and Humidity Keep Emergency Crews Busy
The stagnant heat and humidity that have afflicted the New York region have taken a particular toll on the elderly and those with respiratory problems, causing a 15 percent increase in emergency calls in New York City's five boroughs, officials said yesterday.
While slightly lower humidity and a slight breeze offered some respite yesterday, people suffering from asthma and other respiratory ailments have been staying indoors, their air-conditioners locked on high.
Over the last five weeks, poor ozone conditions have made breathing difficult for those most vulnerable, sometimes forcing them to emergency rooms or to seek advice from physicians, paramedics, even the weatherman.

The AT&amp;T Corporation sent 3,000 of its managers into the nation's capital today for a last-minute lobbying blitz on the only major question that seems unsettled concerning a sweeping House bill to deregulate the communications industry: the date of the vote.
The bill would change almost every aspect of the communications industry, from broadcasting and cable television to telephones, with long-distance phone companies the only clear losers.
The long-distance industry is now fighting to keep the House from voting next week.





THREE BIG UNIONS ARE SET TO MERGE, CREATING A GIANT
In the face of the American labor movement's long-skidding fortunes, three of the nation's biggest industrial unions -- the steel workers, the automobile workers and the machinists -- declared today that they would merge.
They invited other unions to join them.
The merger announced today will take five years to complete, the unions' leaders said, but the result will be a two-million-member behemoth.
Together these unions' wage gains of the 1950's and 1960's led American blue-collar workers into the middle class.
Now these workers are losing ground to inflation, cuts in benefits, and the shrinkage of manufacturing industries.


An Elephant, a Chocolate Bar and Vietnam
In 1968, a group of Green Berets arranged the delivery of an elephant to a small Vietnamese village.
The delivery was airborne.
According to production notes for "Operation Dumbo Drop," Disney's cheery account of that mission, "Were it not for the fateful day the Dumbo Drop mission took place -- the day Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated -- this would have been a newsworthy event."
Well, better late than never.
Now "Operation Dumbo Drop" turns what cannot have been strictly a sunny story into blithe family entertainment, largely overlooking the fact that there was a war going on.
The model for this is a lot closer to "McHale's Navy," which is mentioned here, than it is to "Platoon." But in the end, this generally lighthearted Vietnam caper does try to teach a lesson of sorts, since the gift of an elephant becomes a form of war reparations.
As one of the film's American officers puts it, "Maybe we all need to do one good thing before we go."

Another Take on 'Uncle Vanya,' Set in Australia
For a man who rarely leaves his estate, Uncle Vanya seems to be everywhere lately.
In the last year, he has turned up as Wallace Shawn in the modern-dress film "Vanya on 42d Street" and as Tom Courtney on Broadway.
Another Vanya film, directed by and starring Anthony Hopkins, is in the works.
This explosion of Vanyas is a tribute to the enduring emotional truth and turmoil in Chekhov's rich and malleable play, which has been given yet another unexpected twist in "Country Life." As written and directed by Michael Blakemore, it is less an adaptation than a spinoff of "Uncle Vanya."
Mr.
Blakemore transports Chekhov's plot and characters to a sheep ranch in Australia in 1919, and creates a film of charm and visual splendor.
He greatly enhances the comedy of the story, in direct proportion to how much he short-changes its emotions.
"Country Life" is Chekhov Lite, and it works best as a terrifically acted comedy of manners.

The rules that govern how many hours a truck driver may work were written in 1937, and the consensus of both the industry and its regulators is that it is time to change them.
There are Interstate highways now, gears that shift more easily and suspensions that smooth the ride so that a driver's head no longer hits the cab ceiling with each bump.
There are quiet cabs, air-conditioning and cruise control, all making it obvious that change is needed.
But it is not so obvious what that change should be.

On Tuesday, for example, Polygram issued the first two cassettes of "The Busy World of Richard Scarry." More than 100 million books by the acclaimed illustrator and storyteller, who died last year, have been sold, and his stories have been incorporated into an animated television series.
To date, however, Mr.

Here was a city, I'd anticipated, for pop-culture epiphanies.
Its streets are on the Monopoly board; Miss America is crowned there every September.
It's a place where American dreams of easy money and perpetual pleasure are vigorously marketed, where there are shows every night and the ocean is just a few steps away from the hoopla.
Beyond three evenings of entertainment -- Donna Summer, the Beach Boys and a revue called "Hot Cha Cha" -- our plans were indefinite: stroll the boardwalk, laze on the beach, eat seafood and gamble a little.
We lost our first gamble at the reception desk.

Dogs, Cats and a Boa Constrictor, Singing
There may be great passion, even nobility, in people's relationships with their pets.
But in the telling, the details of such relationships, like cute baby stories and sexual specifics, tend to be embarrassing and remarkably monotonous.
Unless you are J. R. Ackerly or James Thurber, they are probably best divulged only to intimate, tolerant friends.
Even as nimble a wit as A. R. Gurney doesn't avoid the sticky, sentimental cliches inherent to the subject in his popular comedy "Sylvia" (though Sarah Jessica Parker, as a canine object of desire, does).
There is now, however, a musical revue that makes that dog lover's exercise in fluff seem like "The Critique of Pure Reason." It is called (in a wishful echo of the title of the eternal hit "Cats") "Pets!," and it opened last night at the Theater East.


Rangers' Rally Ends Slide At 10
Rangers 2, Orioles 1
Will Clark and Mickey Tettleton hit consecutive run-scoring doubles in the eighth inning last night to help the Texas Rangers end their 10-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the host Baltimore Orioles.
The Rangers were on the verge of their fourth consecutive one-run loss before rallying to beat the Orioles for the first time in five games this season.
The 10-game skid was the longest in the majors this season and the Rangers' longest since a 12-game drought in 1982.


Road Warriors in Pink In a Biking Documentary
The most likable of the several women profiled in "She Lives to Ride," Alice Stone's breezy documentary film about women on motorcycles, is an 82-year-old road warrior named Dot Robinson who tools around Florida on a pink Harley-Davidson that has a lipstick case built into its handlebars.
Although she might well reject the label, Ms.
Robinson is certainly a feminist pioneer.
In 1935, she and her husband, Earl, set the record for a cross-country motorcycle run (89 hours), with a sidecar attached.
After winning a 500-mile endurance run on the East Coast, Ms.
Robinson waged a successful campaign to overturn the American Motorcycle Association's ban on including women in its national competition.
She went on to found the Motor Maids, a flourishing women's motorcycle club whose members wear quaint blue uniforms, white boots and white handkerchiefs.

Anyone who has ever been trapped in voice-mail hell -- when a computer-generated voice answers the phone and gives five minutes of options you can't escape -- will latch onto the neat, technophobic idea behind "The Net." Sandra Bullock, as a meek computer expert named Angela Bennett, stumbles across a program so powerful it can tamper with Wall Street, air-traffic control and the Federal Government.
When the program's vile owners come after her, they create a big-time equivalent of the machine that ate your bank card: the computers eat her identity.
Her fingerprints, Social Security number and picture I.D. are transferred to someone else, and Angela Bennett vanishes.
If the computers say you don't exist, how can you prove that you do?
This paranoid fantasy is so resonant that it makes "The Net" an enjoyably creepy thriller, even though Irwin Winkler belongs to the nothing-is-too-obvious school of directing.

This posthumous exhibition introduces Leigh Bowery, performance artist, drag queen, model and fashion designer extraordinaire, and, as an afterthought, acknowledges his better-known persona, the Leigh Bowery who appears, large and naked, in several of Lucian Freud's best recent paintings and prints.
Mr.
Bowery was large and well-proportioned, with a great sense of humor and style, as well as a beautifully androgynous face that took well to imaginative makeup.
He operated in the gap between art and fashion, and the evidence here suggests that he fulfilled his destiny with unusual efficiency.


Penny-Pinching on Nicaragua
Senator Jesse Helms's vindictiveness should not be allowed to threaten the tiny amount of foreign aid Washington now sends to Nicaragua.
Mr.
Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has cooked up a bogus issue to hold over the head of Nicaragua's President, Violeta Chamorro.
He says her Government has not made enough progress in settling the claims of American citizens whose property was seized by the Sandinistas after their revolution in 1979.
Before Monday President Clinton must certify that Nicaragua's actions on settling the property disputes and on human rights is satisfactory.
Otherwise aid will be cut off unless he grants a waiver.


Wounded Man Pulls Bullet From Head
A 73-year-old retired Manhattan construction worker who was shot above his right eye by his 53-year-old companion used his fingers to pull the bullet from the wound in his forehead while being treated at Harlem Hospital Center, the police said.
The victim, John Bryant, of 305 West 149th Street, was shot during an argument with Florence Grady, his companion for the last 15 years, said a police spokesman, Doram Tamari.
But the .22-caliber bullet, fired by a small, two-shot Derringer pistol, apparently failed to penetrate his skull.


When Artwork Has a Sticky Back
The ancient Romans liked to decorate their rooms with frescos of villas and landscapes.
Wallpaper designers in the 19th century depicted Gothic castles.
"Kitsch to Corbusier: Wallpapers From the 1950's," at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, opens with a 1954 design showing modern houses nestled on leafy Californian hillsides: you could enjoy the fantasy of inhabiting a sprawling villa even if you actually lived in a cramped city apartment.
Joanne Kosuda-Warner, the curator of "Kitsch to Corbusier,"presents the 1950's as a golden age of wallpaper, prompted, paradoxically, by a drastic drop in sales.
Manufacturers strove to make their papers easier to hang, more durable and, above all, more fun.
To overcome wallpaper's stodgy image, designers adopted modern motifs like rocket ships and television antennas, ranch houses and electron orbits.
What's more, they adopted the visual language of modern art.

San Francisco Museum Expands
Los Angeles won't be the only West Coast city with an interesting mix of just-renovated museums: San Francisco is catching up fast.
In January, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art opened its new $60 million, 225,000-square-foot building.
Now the Legion of Honor has announced that in November it will reopen its building, a 1924 reproduction of an 18th-century French palace, which has been closed for three years.
The project completes the reorganization of all the art belonging to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.
The Legion of Honor renovation, which has not altered the building's neo-classical facade, includes a 35,000-square-foot expansion, increasing the museum's space by 42 percent.
The garden level gained a 9,500-square-foot temporary exhibition gallery, skylit courtyard and study center.
The museum has also been strengthened to protect it from earthquakes.

Parents' Deaths Were Fatal To Helpless Son
For a week before he died, officials say Barry Jacobs, who was mentally and physically handicapped, lay on his living room couch without food or water, unable to help himself as his parents lay dead in the same room.
Mr.
Jacobs and his parents were found dead on Tuesday at the Hastings Village condominiums after neighbors complained of a foul odor from their one-bedroom apartment.


In Justice Breyer's Opinion, A Footnote Has No Place
Any reader of Supreme Court opinions knows that the devil is in the details: those pesky footnotes that Justices use to amplify, minimize or otherwise muddy what they have just written in the text.
Justices also use footnotes to bash one another or, less frequently, to offer an olive branch to a colleague whose vote they need to hold a fragile majority.
Given that context, it is notable, if not unprecedented (no one keeps records on this sort of thing), that Justice Stephen G. Breyer went through his freshman year on the Court without writing a footnote.
This was scarcely an oversight.


Times Mirror Chief Stresses Primacy of Newspapers
After weeks of announcing layoffs and closing newspapers, Mark H. Willes, the new chief executive of the Times Mirror Company, laid out in his first interview here today a surprisingly conservative view of the company and how he intends to expand it by focusing largely on its papers.
Mr.
Willes insisted that the heavy rounds of cutbacks, which included the swift shutting down of New York Newsday and hundreds of layoffs at The Los Angeles Times, were painful but necessary to restore the company's financial health.
He said that more cuts were coming in the corporate headquarters, but that other publications, like The Hartford Courant, were safe.


Sleazy Sex in Manila To Support the Family
Late in "Midnight Dancers," Mel Chionglo's sprawling drama of three brothers caught up in Manila's subculture of male prostitution, the youngest brother, Sonny (Lawrence David), stops for a moment to reflect on the spiritual cost of selling one's body to strangers night after night.
"We lost something," says the character, who with his baby-faced pout looks barely 18.
"I don't know what, but something, somehow is lost."


Supporters Of Sex Zoning Stand Fast
City Council leaders, facing increased public criticism of a plan to impose strict zoning regulations on sex-related businesses, said yesterday that their support for the measure had not wavered.

Yesterday, James Treffinger, the County Executive, announced that he had found someone capable of turning the center around.
The new director will be Joe Clark, the former principal of Eastside High School in Paterson, whose approach to education was portrayed in the 1989 movie "Lean on Me."

Jaime de Mora y Aragon, 70, A Noble Spanish Bon Vivant
Jaime de Mora y Aragon, a flamboyant Spanish aristocrat whose amiable antics made him the toast of the Costa del Sol, died on Wednesday at a hospital near his home in Marbella, Spain.
He was 70.
His doctors said the cause was the latest of a series of a heart attacks he had suffered in recent years.
Whether he was playing the piano in a Marbella cabaret or wrestling in Argentina, Mr. de Mora cut a memorable figure.
With his tall, slender build, slicked-back hair, waxed mustache, monocle and cane, he was once likened to a blue-blooded Salvador Dali.
As a fixture in Marbella since the early 1960's, Mr. de Mora, or Jimmy as he was widely known, became such a favorite among the wealthy and wellborn who make the resort their summer playground that he was named by the city's tourist office as its official greeter.
The role suited him.
For although he was at various times a waiter, bullfighter, taxi driver, model and movie actor, Mr. de Mora was primarily a promoter, one who provided the public face for an assortment of business ventures from nightclubs to theatrical productions financed with other people's money.
Even his lavish annual parties were someone else's extravagance, that of the Saudi financier Adnan N. Khashoggi.
The son of a wealthy count and a member of a collateral line of the Spanish royal family, Mr. de Mora was born in Madrid with an array of advantages, most of which he promptly put behind him.
Dropping out of school at the age of 17, he entered the bohemian life of Paris, learned to play the piano and married a Mexican actress and later a Swedish model.
His role as an international gadabout was curtailed somewhat in 1965, when he was convicted in asbentia in Italy for passing bad checks.
For all his popularity in Spain, Mr. de Mora was apparently considered a bit much by the Belgian royal family.
In 1960, when his sister, Fabiola, married King Baudouin, he was excluded from the wedding.
Mr. de Mora secured some revenge of sorts.
Cast as the Belgian Ambassador in an Italian film, he played the diplomat in drag.
Even in his official role with the tourist office, Mr. de Mora tended to go over the top.
Last August, for example, to publicize an annual gathering of motorcyclists, he put out the word that Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley had chosen Marbella for a belated honeymoon.
The announcement drew a horde of gullible photographers as look-alikes enlisted by Mr. de Mora were escorted by 50 motorcycles.
He is survived by his wife, the former Margit Ohlson, and his adopted son Fernando, who as Fernando Diaz Santiago had been his longtime personal secretary before a legal adoption in 1992.

A Train Along the Nile Reflects a 'Real' Egypt
Train 857, four dented and unpainted third-class passenger cars attached to a 20-year-old diesel locomotive, clanked and groaned its way out of the Aswan station, barely outpacing the donkey carts along the road.
Some of the passengers who were jammed into the cars would be carried for the next 11 hours through dun-colored mud-brick villages and green fields of corn, sunflowers and rice paddies to the Luxor station, but many hopped off at the 35 stops along the route.
The train never strayed from the fertile ribbon of land that hugs the Nile.
Though 98 percent of the country's people live along the river, a third-class railroad car is a reminder that Egypt is two countries.

Carmen Lomas Garza  Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris 120 Park Avenue (at 42d Street) Through Sept. 22
Carmen Lomas Garza's painting "Beds for Dreams" was one of the strongest images from "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation," a show that traveled the country four years ago, and it was also one of the quietest.
It depicted a small white clapboard house at night.
On the roof, two young girls gazed, enchanted, at the full moon breaking through clouds, while in a room below their mother spread coverlets on their beds.

Senate Vote to End Embargo May Prove a Pyrrhic Victory
After their vote to break the arms embargo on Bosnia, senators of both parties acknowledged today that their action may well produce no result this year and could lead to the dispatch of American troops to help in the withdrawal of the United Nations force.
A number of senators expressed their anguish about a vote that amounts to a judgment that the peacemaking effort in Bosnia is futile and that the warring sides must be left to fight to the bitter end.
But they said they had concluded that the alternatives were much worse.

We Won't Get Far Without Affirmative Action; A Backward Move
To the Editor:
I applaud President Clinton for taking a strong position to uphold affirmative action.
Republican attempts to dismantle this program designed to achieve equal opportunity for minorities and women in the work force is mean-spirited and antithetical to the aims of what we claim America to be as a democracy.


Article Says 2 Authors Tried to Exploit Times List
Business Week reported yesterday that a careful campaign may have manipulated the sales of a nonfiction book to get it on the influential best-seller list of The New York Times.
The magazine described what it said was an effort "to inflate and breach the integrity" of The Times's system for measuring book sales by placing bulk orders and systematic small orders with book sellers whose sales results might be tallied by the paper.

No Time for Showtime On U.S. Olympic Team
In a variation on the theme of pro basketball's summer, all those perceived as showoffs and troublemakers from last year's United States team at the world championships have been locked out of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
According to a person close to USA Basketball, written or oral acceptances have already been received from the first 10 players picked by the selection committee.
The list, predictably enough, does not include many of the controversial young guns from last summer's world championship team like Derrick Coleman, Alonzo Mourning, Larry Johnson and Shawn Kemp.

International Briefs; Allianz Profit Is Up
Allianz Versicherung A. G., Europe's largest insurer, said yesterday that its profit rose 11 percent in 1994, excluding one-time gains, as a "significant reduction" in its underwriting loss compensated for premium-income growth of less than 1 percent.
Net income in 1994 was 1.34 billion Deutsche marks ($964 million) compared with a 1993 net profit of 1.46 billion marks, but that included a one-time gain of 253 million marks from tax benefits.
The results were in line with preliminary figures released by the company in May. (Bloomberg Business News)


The Baby Bells and their new technology begin to shake up the hotel-based television industry.
SPONSORED information services for hotel guests, once as drowsy as a tired traveler, are getting a loud wake-up call in the form of interactive technology.
But advertisers are proceeding cautiously as some big new entrants to the field are already deciding to, well, check out.
The industry was long characterized by small, entrepreneurial companies producing programs on videotape loops or laser disks for the closed-circuit television systems of hotels and resorts.
The services were prototypically passive: guests need only turn on the set -- often pretuned to the channels carrying them -- and watch.


China Offers a Video Interrogation


Investigating Attacks on Turtles
Who (or what) is mutilating the sea turtles of New Jersey?
In the past month, at least three turtles have been deliberately killed and four others badly cut, The Associated Press reported.
Mechanical causes -- a tugboat, used by the Army Corps of Engineers in a dredging project, for example -- have not been ruled out, but some of the turtles were clearly attacked by people, state officials said.
The corps and the National Marine Fisheries Service are investigating.

On My Mind; Arresting The Negotiators
The top political and military leaders of the Bosnian Serbs must be arrested and held for war-crime trials if they appear in any country in the world.
This decision by a United Nations tribunal pleases Western governments trapped in the Bosnian disaster as it will please millions passionate against the Bosnian Serbs.
All right, then, the question is: What now?
How do you negotiate with men you demand be arrested on sight?
The answers I get from officials of the U.S., the U.N., the tribunal and diplomatic veterans of Bosnian peace negotiations are totally clear: "We don't know."
The price of making negotiations impossible by issuing arrest warrants for one side can be terrifyingly high.
Without peace talks, the ever-deeper Western involvement can bring Europe to where it stood 81 years ago this week -- at the cusp of a world war.
The issue was what Bismarck had predicted would bring war one day -- "some damn foolish thing in the Balkans." It turned out to be Serbia.
Crowds in Austria, which wanted to swallow Serbia, screamed, "Serben mussen sterben." Serbs must die.
The outlines of a Bosnian solution have been heartbreakingly obvious.
Yesterday I received a faxed letter from one of the indicted men, the Bosnian Serb President, Radovan Karadzic.
It came after I had inquired among supporters of the Bosnian Serbs in the U.S. about the Serbs' bottom line.
Dr.
Karadzic said the "blueprint for peace" was a European plan of 1993, originated by Lord Owen of Britain and Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway.
It called for the recognition of Muslim, Croatian and Serbian republics within a loose Bosnian government.
The plan gave 49 percent of the land to the Muslim republic, 33.5 to the Serbs and 17.5 percent to the Bosnian Croats, and proposed two years of U.N. administration of Sarajevo.
Dr.
Karadzic said that the plan meant self-determination for all parts of the former Yugoslavia.
Interpretation: The Serbs must have the same rights of self-determination and alliance that the Muslims and Croatia have won.
The Bosnian Serbs and Croats accepted the European plan; the Muslims did not.
Two years later, the West has to recognize that putting pressure on the Bosnian Serbs will not bring peace unless some is also put on the Muslims.
But how to resume negotiations?
One way would be for the top Serbs to fly off somewhere, maybe Pakistan or Iran, which have offered to jail them, and hold out their wrists.
Or the West could do what the Muslims want -- stall negotiations until the Bosnian Serbs are smashed.
That would take a massive Western invasion, followed by an occupation to keep the Serbs submissive, something not even the Nazis managed.
The other is to think of gimmicks to get around the negotiating roadblock of the arrest edict.
Hold them in Bosnia?
No, that would make the site an instant death trap.
U.N. headquarters?
Not legal, says the tribunal prosecutor.
An Italian judge even raises the question whether any country can negotiate with indicted men.
So -- "We don't know."
The concept of war-crime trials is important.
But after the World War II trials, the nations lost enthusiasm.
Saddam Hussein was not tried for invading Kuwait.
Hafez al-Assad of Syria got away clean with capturing Lebanon.
That fellow in Libya, whose terrorists the West says blew up Pan Am 103, still sits in his deluxe tent, receiving figs and ambassadors.
Pol Pot faced no court for mass murder in Cambodia.
The Communist Chinese not only get away with using torture and slavery as tools in the international market, but have a judge sitting on that U.N. tribunal.
The nations run from every war-crime trial that is politically or economically inconvenient, which has meant everybody but the Bosnian Serbs.
Still, the world should not bury war-crime charges with the victims.
The tribunal has not finished looking into charges against Muslims and Croats.
Any trials should come when peace is negotiated -- and for accused from all sides at the same time.
Like Congressional pressure to arm the Muslims, the Serb-only indictments, coming now, postpone peace.
Every delay kills more people, every single day, to no avail.
In that other July, in 1914, then too the great men of power did not believe it could ever really happen, the guns of August.

Trade Chief Sees a U.S. Loss on Pact
The Director General of the World Trade Organization said today that the Clinton Administration would not gain an advantage by choosing not to join the new agreement to liberalize trade in financial services.
In fact, he said the United States was likely to reverse its position eventually and join the pact.
Renato Ruggiero, head of the trade body, said in an interview that the United States was mistaken to think it could win better foreign access for its banks, insurance companies and other financial companies by negotiating directly with individual governments in Asia and Latin America.


A Royal Tribute Without the Guest of Honor
It was music minus one, a kingdom without a king, an event conceived around an absence to make the heart grow fonder.
Carnegie Hall's three sold-out concerts celebrating the music of Frank Sinatra on Monday through Wednesday conjured up many of the elements of Mr.

PRO FOOTBALL: In Minnesota, Hardship and a Fallen Star; Rocky Off Season for the Vikings Culminates in Moon's Arrest in Assault
Off season in the National Football League is a time for each club to lick its wounds, to reload, to rededicate and to prepare for the grueling 16-game run to the playoffs and the Super Bowl.
For the Minnesota Vikings, however, it has been sheer turmoil.
Their brutal off season began last winter after a stunning, listless 35-18 playoff loss at home to the Chicago Bears (a team Minnesota had beaten twice in the regular season) was quickly followed by accusations of sexual harassment against the Vikings' head coach, Dennis Green, and the team's defensive backs coach, Richard Solomon.

International Briefs; Philips Earnings Jump 45% in Quarter
Philips Electronics N. V. said yesterday that its earnings for the second quarter jumped 45 percent, helped by strong sales of its semiconductors.
Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics company, earned 583 million guilders, or $376 million, on sales of 14.66 billion guilders, or $9.4 billion.
That compares with last year's earnings of 402 million guilders on sales of 14.3 billion guilders.
Sales in the first six months rose 4.7 percent, to 29.28 billion guilders, or $18.8 billion, from 27.96 billion guilders last year.
Philips said semiconductor sales "performed exceptionally well," growing 27 percent. (AP)

House Rebuffs Many Budget Amendments
The House today turned down dozens of spending bill amendments that sought to protect billions of dollars in housing and environmental programs, many of which were landmark achievements of liberal Congresses stretching back nearly a quarter-century.
"This bill is going to be very controversial without any question," said Representative Jerry Lewis, the California Republican who heads the subcommittee that wrote the bill.
"But it does put us on a pathway that gives us a real shot of balancing the budget by 2002."


Managua Journal; Ghosts in Nicaragua? No, Somozas in the Flesh
Their name may still be regarded here as a synonym for corruption and brutality.
But ever so cautiously, the Somoza family is beginning to return to Nicaragua, hoping to find a place now that memories of its five decades of dictatorship are beginning to fade.
Three brothers, grandsons of the founder of the dynasty that ruled this country as a classic banana-republic dictatorship from 1933 to 1979, are leading that effort and say ordinary Nicaraguans are proving surprisingly receptive.

HBO-Showtime Clash Is Pretty Fine Bout, Too
As rain pelted an umbrella at Bryant Park shortly after Wednesday's Evander Holyfield-Riddick Bowe outdoor news conference was canceled, a well-dressed young man calmly ate a sandwich and discussed the bubbling excitement he felt about Mike Tyson's return.
"I'd pay to watch him fight my mother," he said.
But would he pay for Bowe-Holyfield ("The People's Championship") and Tyson-His Mom if both aired on pay-per-view the same night?


Defending Smith, Stepfather Says He Also Bears Blame
Susan Smith's stepfather, who admitted that he had molested her when she was a teen-ager and had consensual sex with her as an adult, told her and his town that he shared her guilt in the drowning deaths of her young sons.
Mrs.
Smith's defense, which rested its case today in the penalty phase of her murder trial, did what many people in this small town have wondered about for months: it called to the stand her stepfather, Beverly Russell, to accept part of the blame for the deaths of the two little boys last Oct. 25.


2 Dead in Bodega Robbery
A store owner and an employee were shot and killed last night during a robbery at a bodega in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, the police said.
Shortly after 10 P.M., two men entered the grocery store at 235 Stuyvesant Avenue and announced a robbery, said Detective Mark Patterson, a police spokesman.


A New Formula for Health Plans
American employers have been trying for years to tame rising medical costs by pushing workers into health maintenance organizations and other plans that limit their choices of doctors and hospitals.
But many employees balked at the restrictions.
So the employers found a compromise -- plans in which members are encouraged to use an H.M.O. or other network, but can also choose doctors or hospitals outside the network and still be repaid for part of the cost, although not as much as under their old plans.
These so-called hybrid plans are now the fastest-growing kind of health plan, with almost 10 million members by last month, more than double the number just two and a half years earlier.
Employers are counting on them to bring the most reluctant of their workers into the world of managed care; indeed, many small and medium-sized companies are now offering their employees a hybrid plan and nothing else.
Hybrids were a big attraction for the United Healthcare Corporation when it agreed last month to buy Metrahealth, the health insurance venture of the Travelers Group and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
With the addition of Metrahealth, United Healthcare would have 2.8 million members in hybrid plans.

But this does little to reassure travelers who take little comfort from techno-speak about backup technology.
Some air traffic controllers voice the same concern.
The malfunctions at the control center in Aurora, Ill., outside Chicago, were not the same as the troubles at the New York center on Long Island in the spring.
There was one ominous similarity, however.
Both episodes involved old equipment, some of it 25 years old.

Rosario Silva was determined to suffer no more.

Four times a day she had made a mad rush to the bathroom for a cold shower.
Her two window fans seemed only to mock her, blowing hot air into her face.
On Friday, after another day of unbearable heat and a string of sleepless nights, she made a life-changing decision: she would buy an air-conditioner.

It's Anger, So They Scream
Filter, which performed on Tuesday night at Limelight, is an exercise in bottled rage.
The band, whose debut album, "Short Bus" (Reprise), has been slowly climbing the pop charts for three months, consists of five ordinary-looking guys expressing their anger in the simplest way a rock band can.
They scream and play their guitars loudly.
But Filter doesn't play heavy metal, grunge, punk or industrial rock, though two members used to work with the group Nine Inch Nails.
It plays something in between.
Taking a tip from the minimalist composers Glenn Branca and Rhys Chatham, Filter has learned that when a short progression is played simultaneously on multiple instruments, the result can be power and intricacy.
At Limelight, three guitarists and a bassist hammered power chords in unison as Matt Walker mechanically beat a hard, brittle rhythm.
Occasionally, Brian Liesegang supplemented his guitar frenzy with electronic drones and noises, which he triggered by stepping on a keyboard that lay at his feet.

Preferences Are Splitting Republicans
Divisions among Congressional Republicans over the issue of affirmative action flared into the open today with one of the party's most prominent black lawmakers declaring that Speaker Newt Gingrich had lied to him and blocked his efforts on the issue.
He said that a proposal by Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, was unacceptable.
The lawmaker, Representative Gary A. Franks of Connecticut, said he could not support a proposal by Mr.
Dole, Republican of Kansas, to abandon all Federal efforts to set sex or race preferences.
But he expressed rage at Mr.
Gingrich who, he said, was blocking an amendment he drafted to halt Federal set-asides, which allot a percentage of Federal contracts to minorities and women.

New Jersey Loses Battle On Air Traffic
New Jersey lost and New York City won in the battle over aircraft noise with an all-but-final decision by the Federal Aviation Administration yesterday on flight patterns from the region's three major airports.
The F.A.A. rejected a New Jersey proposal to reroute air traffic away from northern New Jersey's suburbs and send the planes out over the ocean instead.
The agency said the over-water routes favored by New Jersey citizens groups and the state's Congressional delegation were too dangerous and, in any case, would simply shift the noise over to the homes of people on the Jersey Shore.

North Carolina Judge Rules Against Simpson Legal Team
With a juror ill and in the hospital, the focus of the O. J. Simpson trial moved today to North Carolina, where a judge ruled that a woman who said that Detective Mark Fuhrman used an incendiary racial epithet need not testify in the case.
In Los Angeles, meanwhile, Judge Lance A. Ito revisited but did not rule on whether the defense can argue that the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman were drug-related.
The judge also ruled that Mr.
Simpson's lawyers may see some of the prosecution's original photographs of Mr.
Simpson wearing leather gloves in his sportscasting days.


Lavish Casting of 6 Pianists for Mostly Mozart
They could have divvied up the "Hexameron" Variations, by Liszt and friends, as an encore.
Instead, the six pianists on hand for the Mostly Mozart concert on Thursday evening at Avery Fisher Hall stuck to the program of Mozart concertos.
So lavish was the casting that Alexander Korsantiya, a young pianist from the Republic of Georgia who created a stir in the early rounds of the 1993 Cliburn Competition, played only the rudimentary third-piano part of Mozart's Concerto for Three Pianos (K. 242).
He and the Ukrainian duo Valentina Lisitsa and Alexei Kuznetsoff supplied an abundance of personality in this relatively slender work, written when Mozart was 20.

French Investigation Aims at Salomon and Swiss Bank
Salomon Brothers Inc. and the Swiss Bank Corporation confirmed yesterday that they were being investigated by the French stock market regulatory agency in connection with possible insider trading in shares of Eurotunnel, but they vehemently denied any wrongdoing.
The agency, Commission des Operations de Bourse, said this week that two financial institutions were suspected of insider trading in the shares of Eurotunnel before a $1.2 billion stock sale in May 1994.
The two were among the underwriters of the issue.
The commission did not identify the institutions, but the names of Salomon Brothers, a unit of Salomon Inc., and Swiss Bank later appeared in the French press.

Man Is Killed In Park Area Along Hudson
A man who appeared to be in his 50's was shot and killed in the middle of the afternoon yesterday in Riverside Park, and his body -- with a single bullet hole in the forehead -- was discovered sprawled beneath a park bench.
Even though the shooting occurred between 91st and 92d Street in a section of the park usually filled in the afternoon with joggers and families, investigators said they were having difficulty finding reliable witnesses, and they did not know last night who the man was or why he was killed.

It was Mike Conley, the 1992 Olympic champion, against Al Joyner, the 1984 Olympic champion, in the triple-jump super matchup on the first of three days of track and field at the United States Olympic Festival.
But the matchup proved a bust because Conley was bad until he won on his last jump and Joyner was just plain awful.
Conley had trouble with his approach, and after five of the six rounds he had cleared only 53 feet 3 3/4 inches (his career best is 58-7 1/2).
He seemed about to finish fifth.

McDowell Has Trouble With a Twins Rookie
It will be remembered as the day the Yankees made a bold statement by acquiring David Cone.
It will be remembered as the day they exchanged problem children by trading Danny Tartabull to Oakland for Ruben Sierra.
What the Yankees do not want to remember about tonight is the stunning two-run homer Dan Masteller crushed off Jack McDowell in the ninth inning to catapult the Twins to a 5-3 victory.
So while Yankee officials were celebrating superb moves made off the field in the Bronx and Tampa, Fla., the team was dejected after succumbing to the hapless Twins and failing to make the day a total success.
McDowell walked Matt Walbeck to start the bottom of the ninth in poor fashion, and the Yankees were expecting Masteller, a .183 hitter, to bunt.
Instead, the rookie pounded McDowell's high fastball into the right-field upper deck for his first career homer.

But the dearth of men who neither smoke nor drink nor sleep around is not only something Russian women have complained about for generations, it is now the lament of Russian infertility specialists.


Patti Smith, With Nuances of Mourning
"A sacred peep show" was how Patti Smith, the influential punk poet and musician of the 1970's, described a 1972 Rolling Stones concert.
Her performance on Thursday night at Central Park Summerstage was similar.
She went through a whirlwind of emotions: she was nervous and confident, sad and joyful, vulnerable and strong.
But above all, she was mesmerizing.
As she stumbled and found her way again through her poems and songs during this rare public appearance, an adoring and empathetic audience of around 9,000 seemed to experience every high and low along with her.
It was a short performance, but an exhausting one.
"I shall not return," Ms.
Smith, 48, said at the beginning of the show, "because I was never gone." She was referring to her move in 1979, when she left the life of rock and prose in New York to raise a family in a suburb of Detroit with her husband, Fred (Sonic) Smith of the proto-punk band the MC5.
Last year, Mr.
Smith and Ms.
Smith's brother, Todd, both died.
One reason the concert was so tenuous and fragile was these undertones of grief, recovery and, though Ms.
Smith might not like to admit it, re-emergence.

All was quiet today in Coconut Grove, the Miami neighborhood where a mostly white world of affluence and tourist glitz mixes with a mostly black world of poverty and drugs.
But the calm masks tensions that erupted in violence on Thursday night.

Treasury Urges Merger of Bank Insurance Funds

Rezoning the Sex Shops
As might have been predicted, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plan to impose strict zoning regulations on sex-related businesses is being criticized by opponents who fear that the new rules will drive such establishments into their neighborhoods.
Council Speaker Peter Vallone and Councilman Walter McCaffrey of Queens, the plan's key supporters when the Council approved the plan in draft form late last year, are standing firm.
They are right to do so because the Mayor's strategy of regulating the location and concentration of sex-oriented adult businesses is sound.
Under the current proposal, which the Council must vote on again if, as expected, it is approved by the City Planning Commission in September, sex-related businesses could operate only in manufacturing districts and "commercial zones of high density" in Manhattan, including parts of this newspaper's Times Square neighborhood.
To prevent any area from becoming an unappealing "red light" district, the plan pursues a dispersal strategy.
It would prevent sex-related businesses from operating within 500 feet of residences, schools and houses of worship and within 500 feet of one another.

Unicef Helps in Bosnia
To the Editor:
Nearly everyone has criticized the United Nations peacekeeping performance in Bosnia.
But there has been remarkably little attention paid to the organization's humanitarian role.
Few commentators seem to know that a number of United Nations agencies, including the United Nations Children's Fund, have been providing food, water, essential medicines and clothing to the many thousands of terrified and distraught women and children caught in this savage civil war.
Unicef has sent teams of trauma experts to work with children in the refugee camps in Tuzla and other areas.
They've also been helping to carry out a rapid immunization program for refugee children against measles, polio, diphtheria and tuberculosis.

In a broadening of the Balkan strife, Croatian forces were reported tonight to be pressing forward through Serbian-held territory in a possible campaign to regain their own occupied land.
The immediate effect of the Croatian incursion may be to relieve the beleaguered forces of the Bosnian Government in the northwestern enclave of Bihac, which has been under attack by Serbian troops over the last week.


Ex-Official Says President Had No Role in Waco Siege
Webster L. Hubbell, a friend of President Clinton and once the third-ranking official at the Justice Department, testified today at Congressional hearings on the siege of the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., that the President never tried to influence the decision to use tear gas to end the standoff.
At the start of the hearings, which ended their eighth day today, Republicans had hinted that they might unearth secret contacts between Mr.
Clinton and officials like Mr.
Hubbell, who played a role in the decision to attack the compound.
But a panel of current and former officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department who were questioned today gave them no such ammunition.

Go East, young man!
Give up the anonymity of being a trader.
Come to Prague, get in on the ground floor and at thirtysomething acquire the power and prestige of a big, strapping fish in a tiny pond.
After the Berlin wall fell, a handful of ambitious young dealers in financial capitals in the West, convinced there was a fortune for the taking, heard the siren call.
Where the giants of Wall Street, Frankfurt or London did not see enough scale or profit to bother, these entrepreneurs left jobs at firms like Prudential Securities, Salomon Brothers and CS First Boston and landed here in the Czech Republic just as the Government was plunging into capitalism.

T.R.A. Head Dismissed
Less than one year after naming him its first commissioner, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations as expected voted today to dismiss Brian McGrath and close his office because its member race tracks could not agree on a national direction for racing.
Four race tracks had withdrawn from the organization this year and the three major Southern California tracks were threatening to withdraw.
McGrath, a television and marketing executive, was hired last year at a salary of $650,000 to give a national focus to the T.R.A., which is composed of 46 racing associations operating 39 race tracks in the United States and Canada.
His first major initiative, the National Best Seven betting program, lasted only 10 months before it was abandoned for not raising enough money.

Improvising And Other Musical Jokes
What musicians on the bandstand are doing can often be strikingly different from what the audience thinks they are doing.
Take George Coleman's first set on Tuesday night at the Village Vanguard, for instance.
A 60-year-old saxophonist who is a resourceful improviser, Mr.
Coleman has been performing with two members of his quartet -- Harold Maburn, the pianist, and Jamil Nasser, the bassist -- since they attended high school in Memphis.
Their familiarity with one another allows them to turn each performance into a series of inside jokes.
Whereas the crowd could easily have been absorbing the signs of musical emotionalism, including Mr.
Coleman's long-held high notes or his repeated riffs, the musicians were involved in a high-speed, improvisational game.


Reward for Turtle Information
The Humane Society yesterday offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of anyone responsible for the killing of several sea turtles.
"We're witnessing more sick kinds of behavior now than I've ever seen before," said Nina Austenberg, an official with the Humane Society's Mid-Atlantic office, describing a recent spate of deliberate killings and mutilations of endangered giant leatherbacks and loggerhead turtles off the Jersey Shore.
The number for reporting information is (201) 927-5611.


Megan's Law, Rewritten
"Megan's Law," which requires that citizens be notified when a convicted sex offender moves into their community, has survived a challenge in the New Jersey Supreme Court, but it took an odd bit of jurisprudence to do it.
In order to avoid holding the law unconstitutional, the court rewrote it from the bench, inserting safeguards that a panicky New Jersey State Legislature failed to include last year.
Nevertheless, this well-intended law still violates the United States Constitution's prohibition against state laws that retroactively add to the punishment for past crimes.
Even if the state courts ignore this flaw, enacting these laws is unwise.

HOUSE COALITION SETS G.O.P. BACK ON ENVIRONMENT
In environmentalists' first major victory in the House this year, Democrats and moderate Republicans joined today to narrowly reject a Republican leadership proposal that would have dramatically limited the Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement of pollution laws.
The proposal was part of a spending bill that remains unacceptable to the Clinton Administration and the Administration's environmental allies because it would cut the agency's budget by a third.

A Celebrity Upstages The Music
A slice of Los Angeles came to New York on Wednesday night at Irving Plaza.
On the bandstand was Dog Star, featuring Keanu Reeves.
Yes, that Keanu Reeves.
When Hollywood stars like River Phoenix, Johnny Depp and Lou Diamond Phillips have dabbled in rock-and-roll, their bands haven't performed much outside of the nurturing environment of Los Angeles clubs with velvet ropes.
But Dog Star has taken itself seriously enough to embark on a small tour of the country and to start looking for record labels to make a deal.
Mr.
Reeves's role in Dog Star is an expendable one.
He played simple but competent basslines as the band thrashed out punk- and grunge-friendly pop songs.
Since Mr.
Reeves is a celebrity who values versatility -- he is an action hero; he is a romantic lead; he plays hockey; he rides motorcycles; he even recently took the title role in a production of "Hamlet" -- it's doubtful he could give the band the commitment they would need if they signed a recording contract.
Musically, Dog Star wouldn't be any worse without him.
But visually, that's another story.

As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and President Clinton's senior military adviser, General Shalikashvili has brought his own strengths to the job.

The only goal of the program is to increase the level of punishment for prisoners, since state highway officials say they have no use for the crushed rock.

Carolina Jury Rejects Execution For Woman Who Drowned Sons
A jury today decided that Susan Smith should not be put to death for the drowning of her two young sons, and instead should spend the rest of her life in prison, to remember.

The jury's unanimous decision saved Mrs.

A Day of Deals Bolsters Yankees' Pennant Hopes
Suddenly and sensationally, the Yankees, who had already crept back into the pennant race after a disappointing three months, may have resurfaced today as the favorites to grab the American League East title.
They improved themselves handsomely after heisting David Cone from the Toronto Blue Jays for three minor league pitchers while also unloading Danny Tartabull to the Oakland Athletics for Ruben Sierra and a minor league pitcher.
Obtaining the 1994 American League Cy Young Award winner from Toronto for an inexpensive price was a tremendous coup and boost to the Yankees in their pursuit of the first-place Red Sox and their scrap with the Orioles, who obtained Bobby Bonilla from the Mets today.
While the Jays wanted premier prospects for Cone, they received players who were only familiar to minor league experts.

A Remake Of the 1943 'Sahara'
Television remakes of Hollywood classics are usually disastrous.
A stunning exception can be found tomorrow in Showtime's "Sahara," a new version of the 1943 World War II movie that starred Humphrey Bogart as a tough tank commander in North Africa leading a British-American unit that included youngsters like Lloyd Bridges, Bruce Bennett and Dan Duryea.
Now the Bogart character, Sgt.
Joe Gunn, is played by James Belushi, who, less Bogey than Gene Hackman, delivers a terrific performance with stunning authority.
Like most war movies at the time, the original "Sahara," with a script by John Howard Lawson and Zoltan Korda, the director, amounted to skillful propaganda.
The messages were as schematic as any medieval morality play.
There was no mistaking who were the saints, who the sinners.
Gunn, or Sarge, is pure no-nonsense American, getting the job done no matter how many feelings might be bruised.
His was the face peering out from war-bond posters.


Writers Make War Come Alive
"Well, Chamberlain must be looking on the bright sunshine this morning with a good deal of relief," Virginia Woolf wrote in a beautiful, tight script in her diary on Sept. 30, 1938.
Neville Chamberlain, the British Prime Minister, had just reached a peace agreement with Hitler in Munich.
"Now suddenly we can travel &amp; move &amp; use our normal faculties," Woolf wrote.
"No slaughter of the young beneath us." A year later, full-scale war broke out in Europe, and by 1940, Virginia and her Jewish husband, Leonard Woolf, were discussing the possibility of joint suicide should Hitler invade England.
Woolf's diary entries and the letters, manuscripts and memorabilia of other writers from the World War II period are on view this summer in the exhibit "Writers in Wartime: Looking at World War II From the Berg Collection." The show is at the Berg Exhibition Room, a cool, out-of-the-way space on the third floor of the New York Public Library, through Oct. 7.

Career in Bodegas Ends in Death of Man and Son
Across three decades, Perceo Melo had operated bodegas in Brooklyn: one on Rockaway Avenue, another on Franklin Avenue.
In each place, he had made a living and a name for himself among the people he served, extending informal lines of credit, talking about religion and baseball, making sandwiches early each morning for the neighborhood's schoolchildren.
Just a few months ago, his son Julio Antonio had arrived from the Dominican Republic to work with Mr.
Melo at his latest store, Junior's Grocery on Madison Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
"He had a very paternal image," Rosemarie Moore, a mother from Madison Street, said of the 54-year-old Mr.
Melo.
"He had the eyes of a father."

4 Officers Are Suspended, One Is Charged in Accident
Four New York City police officers were suspended yesterday and one was charged with driving while impaired by alcohol after a pedestrian was struck and seriously injured in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.
The accident occurred about 3:30 A.M. at Flatbush Avenue and Avenue R. A pedestrian stepped from between two parked vehicles and was struck by a private car driven by Officer Brian Sharkey, said Wilbur L. Chapman, the Police Department's chief of patrol.

As Hungarians grumble that life isn't as rosy as the former Communists they elected had promised, they are turning to a man in a white suit, shirt and shoes who expounds on the greatness of Hungary as the 1,000-year defender of Europe against the barbarians.
To Hungarians, the bravado sounds vaguely familiar.
Jozsef Torgyan, a 62-year-old lawyer, is the leader of the Smallholders, a 100-year-old party that had its heyday in the 1930's, won the first free elections after World War II, then went underground during Communist rule.

And even though the Clinton Administration has declined to join the new agreement that liberalizes trade in financial services, American banks, insurance companies and brokerage houses still have a chance to obtain new business in fast-growing developing countries because of the pact.
At the same time, however, American money managers may now face increased competition in seeking to manage Japanese public and private pension funds, officials at the World Trade Organization said today.
The funds have a total value of about $1 trillion.

Barter System Is Familiar A.L. East Ploy
Back in April, when the American League East was thought to be the strongest, most competitive division in the major leagues (that was before the strike-delayed season started), the would-be contenders engaged in a flurry of player moves that resembled a game of one-upsmanship.
The day after the Yankees signed John Wetteland, Toronto traded for David Cone.
Two days later, Baltimore signed three free-agent pitchers -- starter Kevin Brown and relievers Doug Jones and Jesse Orosco -- and Boston added catcher Mike Macfarlane, outfielder Mark Whiten and pitcher Rheal Cormier.
In the next 10 days, the Red Sox signed the free-agent pitchers Erik Hanson and Zane Smith.
A few more days passed, and the Orioles signed center fielder Andy Van Slyke.

Symptoms include high fever, severe headache, muscle pain, chills and, in about half of all cases, a rash on the palms or feet.

The Mets also submitted a list of six players for the Orioles to choose from to complete the deal.

Mayor Tries to Beat Heat, Political and Otherwise
In a city where bad weather can turn into a political storm, Mayor Richard M. Daley, who was accused of being caught flat-footed during the deadly heat wave here earlier this month, is poised to declare a "heat emergency" if the temperatures soar, as expected, into the upper 90's this weekend.
The city is already opening air-conditioned centers, delivering ice to shut-ins, setting up telephone banks to check on the elderly and broadcasting warnings on television and radio.
Today, the department of Streets and Sanitation delivered more than 1,000 electric fans to elderly people who live alone.
And the city produced a "Keeping Cool," brochure, which was being circulated in Spanish, Korean, Chinese, Polish, Vietnamese and English.


Children's Books
PINOCCHIO'S SISTER  By Jan Slepian. 122 pp.

A Death In the Family
MADE for television, the movie "A MOTHER'S PRAYER" is based on a true story about one of the five million children who will be orphaned by AIDS by the turn of century.
The film highlights the tragic dilemmas -- and options -- that families and the system face in trying to provide for children left behind by the disease.
Rosemary Holmstrom (Linda Hamilton), the mother of 8-year-old T.J. (Noah Fleiss, in photo with Hamilton), discovers to her horror that she has AIDS.
Rosemary, a 36-year-old secretary from Brooklyn, has no idea how she contracted the virus, although a doctor surmises she may have been infected by her late husband, who had a blood tranfusion.
When Rosemary tells T.J. the news, he covers his ears and refuses to believe her.


Looking for Mobil? Try Hopewell and Gloucester
To the Editor:
The article about the loss of jobs in Mercer County ("The Day the Jobs Got Up and Moved Away," July 23) was strong in information but wrong in geography.
Mobil's research and development center is in Hopewell Township, not, as you printed, in Hopewell Junction, which is in New York State.
Moreover, Paulsboro, another Mobil site, is not in Sussex County but in Gloucester County, 10 miles south of Camden.

Alternative for Children With Cerebral Palsy
TO the strains of his teacher's softly accented phrases like "I am standing tall" and "I am very glad and proud of you," Zachary Borodkin -- his face a mixture of pride and astonishment -- took a few steps and stood erect for a count of 10.
Such a feat would be unremarkable in any other 6-year-old, but Zachary has cerebral palsy -- and these first steps toward independence represented a milestone for him and other children who are similarly afflicted.

Under a proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies thinking about going public could test the waters to see if there's sufficient investor interest to warrant the expense and hassle of an offering.
Companies would be able to advertise on the radio, interrupt your dinner with telephone surveys or hand out fliers to assess your interest.


July 23-29: Carolina Verdict; Life Sentence for Woman Who Drowned Her Sons
Turning aside the death penalty last week, a jury in Union, S.C., decided that Susan Smith must live with her crime.
Mrs.
Smith drowned her children last October, later telling her town and the rest of the country that a black carjacker took them.
The trial peeled back the skin of a small town and the life of a woman betrayed by the men she loved -- from a father who committed suicide, to a stepfather who sexually abused her, to a husband who left her, to a boyfriend who did not want her or her children in his life.
Like a small-town Medea, Mrs.
Smith acted out inexplicably, killing her sons, Michael, 3, and Alex, 14 months.
Her lawyer, David Bruck, argued that she meant to take her own life instead..


Diverse Visions, Common Ground
PAINTERS in the 19th century, portraitists especially, were wont to haul their talents and canvases from town to town.
Today, evidently, it is curators who hit the road.

In the last year here, he has gone from the sublime to the modest.
Having produced the group show "Garden Fresh" at the Trans Hudson Gallery, Mr.
Costa now presents a smaller anthology at Art Builders Inc.
The show's title, "Polyglot," is a bit misleading, since all but two of the eight participants speak the language of abstraction and neither of the exceptions, Holly Zausner and Orlando Cuevas, could be called a Realist.

For Men of Fashion, Anything (Comfortable) Goes
The sultry weather last week called for an eclectic style of dress, a variety seen in the audience attending the New York Men's Shows -- buyers, stylists, designers, fashion groupies and the press.
Left, a threesome of Texas buyers from Neiman Marcus held a business meeting under the shade of trees in Bryant Park, across the street from the Seventh on Sixth Gallery, one of three sites of the designer shows.
The three removed their black suit jackets and used fans given away at the shows, but they never loosened their ties.
The spectrum of dress included traditional lightweight summer business suits and classic seersucker suits.
For others, cotton suits with bold, awning-stripe colors were a relief from the solid color suits that predominated.
Dressing for the shows meant employing the dress-down look that included active sportswear, shirts worn open over tank tops, or dress trousers with suspenders worn over T-shirts.
Black T-shirts were worn under chalk-white linen jackets with pleat-front trousers and sneakers.
The fashionable male refused to be corraled by a single style of dress.


'None Ever Wished It Longer': How to Stamp Out Book Inflation
THE most heartfelt complaint ever put to paper by an overworked literary critic can be found in Samuel Johnson's "Life of Milton": " 'Paradise Lost' is one of the books which the reader admires and lays down, and forgets to take up again. None ever wished it longer than it is." As a practicing book reviewer who spends far too much time wrestling with tombstone-sized slabs of underdone prose, I'm thinking of having that second sentence put on a rubber stamp.
The problem of bloated books -- bibliobesity, as it were -- has always been with us.
The list of classics no one ever wished longer is . . . well, long. (Anybody else care to confess to never having finished "Das Kapital"?) But most of the really fat classics were triple-decker novels.
The novel is a genre in which length can be a virtue; my copy of "The Way We Live Now" is 972 pages, and I wouldn't willingly part with a single paragraph of Trollope.
Therein lies the current crisis: what works in the hands of a master storyteller is anesthetic (or worse) in the hands of a garrulous biographer hellbent on telling everything he knows.


Liberties; Diary of A Mad House
I am missing the doorknob gene, the one that helps you identify tacky doorknobs that need replacing.
It's the same DNA strand that provides insight into window treatments, light fixtures and trompe l'oeil.

I could never fathom why she wanted to make new flower pots look old by smearing yogurt and dirt on them and letting mold grow.

IN SHORT: FICTION
DOSTOEVSKY'S LAST NIGHT  By Christina Peri Rossi. Picador USA, $20.
The tormented gambler in Christina Peri Rossi's novel is a bingo aficionado who haunts not the church halls of American bingo but the casinos of Europe, where this simple game is played with jungle ferocity.
In "Dostoevsky's Last Night," Ms.
Peri Rossi follows a Spanish society-magazine editor named Jorge as he traipses through these smoky establishments in search of a way to reconstruct the shambles of his life.
But Jorge's gambling addiction is more a conversation piece than an actual disease; it's a topic to discuss with his psychoanalyst, his mother, his boss, his ex-wife -- just about anybody.
Ably translated by Laura C. Dail, Ms.
Peri Rossi's novel is really an extended riff on the grand theme of chance.
Unfortunately, Jorge's musings on gambling and the partial descent into madness of his idol, Dostoyevsky, are often eye-catching but rarely wise.
They convey all too accurately the sensation of time and money being frittered away, whether on the foolish dream of pinning down random numbers or on the more modern pursuit of problem-solving through banter.

Making Money: It's a Matter of Time, Not Timing
BUY low.
Sell high.
That's the old saw that guides most successful investors.
So why should anyone buy domestic stocks today, when the market in the United States appears to be gasping for breath after a rapid rise to stratospheric levels?
The answers are just as simple: You should be buying equities for the long term.
And you shouldn't try to time the market.
Time -- not timing -- is the formula for success, most investing experts say.


Silent Tower On 10th Ave. Is Coming Back to Life
Lewis Futterman once said he developed the 31-story Aurora apartment tower at 10th Avenue and 57th Street for "an upscale audience of people who want the convenience of being near their jobs in midtown and who want enough space for a baby grand."
No baby grands arrived, however.
Neither did any residents.
Like other projects that began in an expansive real estate climate but neared completion as the market was convulsing in the late 1980's, the Aurora fell into a limbo from which it is only now emerging.


Other Routes to the Fast Track (With a Few Ifs)
The Kearny Connection is not the only rail project that may soon come to a station near you.
It is part of New Jersey Transit's Urban Core Project, which aims to link and modernize existing lines.
Here are other major proposals:
SECAUCUS TRANSFER This project would allow commuters on the old Erie Lackawanna Lines from Bergen, Passaic and Rockland Counties to get off at a new station in Secaucus and transfer to Amtrak's Northeast Corridor Line, which goes directly into Penn Station in Manhattan.
Those who want to go to midtown will no longer have to get off in Hoboken and take the PATH; their trip should be 20 minutes shorter.
Work has already started on the $448 million station, which is to open in the fall of 2001.
It is being built on land owned by Allied Outdoor Advertising, which granted an easement for the new station on condition that it could build a major new office and retail complex on the site.


Inklings of What Might Have Been
VIRTUOSITY GOES OUT the window in the face of a great sound.
Some people simply have voices an audience wants to hear.
Selena, the 23-year-old Mexican-American singer from Corpus Christi, Tex., who was murdered by a fan on March 31, was just that sort of attraction.
Sometimes her voice quivered.
Sometimes she roughed it up a bit.
At its best, it had a coolness, a type of unadorned passion that can be heard in places on her new album, "Dreaming of You" (EMI Latin/EMI Records).
The album is a posthumous release that in its own scattered way represents the crossover record that she had been planning before her death.
Selena was the queen of tejano music, the music of the Texas-Mexico border, and she was the one who was about to make the style big.
Not only was she selling huge quantities of her own Spanish-language records, but she was poised to release an English-language recording that was uncompleted at her death.


'Disposable Commodity'
To the Editor:
Sarah Bryan Miller's article "Operas in Search of a Second Hearing"  [ July 16 ]  is based on a misconception, namely, that the problem of a new opera sinking from view can be solved by setting up a second production.
In my own experience, this has not been the case.
My opera "Dreyfus," first produced at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1985, received a second production in Bielefeld, Germany, in 1993, and a third production in Vienna last year.
So what now?
Same old problem.


Jersey's Vanishing 'New'
IF THERE WERE FIVE STEVE JOBS  [ SIC ]  OR one Bill Gates in Harlem," observes Newt Gingrich in his capacity of Author, not Speaker, "the entire nature of the community would change." The columnist Richard Cohen commented sourly, "Yes, it would have moved to Jersey."
Catch the usage: Jersey, not New Jersey, the full name of the state.
Robert Wallace of Albany alerted me a few weeks ago to the widespread clipping of the Garden State: "How come a guy in Brooklyn can say, 'Hey, Gino, what say we go over to Jersey today?' and it sounds all right? But if the same guy is in Hoboken and says, 'Hey, Gino, what say we go over to York today?' it sounds wrong. Why?"


The World; Trade's Bottom Line: Business Over Politics
EARLIER this month Henry A. Kissinger and a delegation of American business executives and academics paid a visit to Li Peng, China's Prime Minister.
As would be expected at a moment when relations between the two countries has reached a low point -- on human rights, missile proliferation and Taiwan -- the opening minutes were spent with Mr.
Li complaining about Taiwan's President visiting the United States, and with the Americans pressing the case of Harry Wu, the imprisoned human rights activist.
What surprised the visitors, however, was how quickly Mr.
Li dropped those issues and jumped right into business: Power projects that need foreign capital, China's plans for buying and building new passenger aircraft, the giant Three Gorges Dam project.
"He made it very, very clear that he had no intention of letting these huge diplomatic disputes affect the economic relationship," said C. Fred Bergsten, a prominent economist and adviser to the Clinton Administration, who was along on the trip.
"It was as if we were talking about two completely separate relationships."


Modish Culinary Mix With Marina View
THE new waterside scene this summer is Paradise Bar &amp; Grille, facing the Stamford Landing marina and west branch of Stamford harbor.
The large dining area opens directly to the marina, and chairs and tables spill out to the open air.
Inside, a full-width, vibrantly painted mural on the back wall evokes an idyllic tropical paradise of exotic foliage and birds.
The food is more familiar, offering current culinary fads from grilled chicken quesadillas to tomato bruschetta -- a precis of Caribbean, Asian and Italian favorites.
A category called "pizzas from paradise" features five items with names like Gone Native, Four Winds, Margherita and Tobago Trio.
But on inspection, a hibiscus (or rose, if you prefer) by any other name turns out to be the basics, not the tropics -- variations on the old tomato-mozzarella, basil-garlic-mushroom-sausage theme.


Struggling Nude Cabaret Says It Will Reamin Open
After a brief brush with bankruptcy, Wiggles, a cabaret that features naked dancers, has reached a tentative agreement with its landlord, the club's major creditor, and will remain open -- much to the chagrin of its many neighborhood foes.
A lawyer for Wiggles said last week that the club, a target of protests since it opened a year ago, had yet to turn a profit.
But the lawyer, Andrew D. Presberg, said that the bankruptcy filing had been a maneuver to prevent the landlord from seizing the club's assets.


Fire, Ready, Aim
Lost in the commotion about the Senate vote to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia, and President Clinton's threat to veto such a move, is a small fact of some importance: Both the President's policy and the Congress's policy duck the real issue in Bosnia and are formulas for continued war.
What are our real interests in Bosnia?
They are four: halt the killing, prevent the conflict from spreading, prevent the conflict from turning into a Christian-Muslim holy war and insure that it does not end in a way that permanently damages America's ties with its European allies, NATO and Russia.


Q. &amp; A.
A Delay On Title Insurance  Q It is almost 20 months since I closed on my house in New Jersey, and I have not yet received my title insurance policy from the title company.
My lawyer tells me I will get it sooner or later.
Can you tell me what kind of risk I am exposed to in the absence of the policy and what I can do to get the policy soon? . . .
Santhanam Pattabiraman, Tenafly, N.J.
A Stephen M. Flatow, in-house counsel for Vested Title Inc., a title insurance company in Jersey City, N.J., said that the usual reason for a delay in issuing a title insurance policy is that there are one or more title "exceptions" that have not been resolved to the satisfaction of the title insurance company.
An exception, Mr.
Flatow said, is an issue or condition affecting title to the property that must be resolved or cleared before the title company will insure that the purchaser has received clear title.
An example of an exception, Mr.
Flatow said, would be a previous mortgage on the property that has not been properly discharged and canceled or a judgment against a former owner that has not been satisfied.
Another possible reason for a delay in issuing a title policy could be the result of a problem that occurred in the closing process itself, such as an error on one of the closing documents that might require the production and filing of a corrective document.
Mr.
Flatow added that since the purpose of a title policy is to protect the purchaser against claims by others that may affect title to the property, there is a risk when a policy is not issued.
"If a claim is asserted against the property," Mr.
Flatow said, "and it is based on one of the exceptions that await resolution, the purchaser may find that the title insurance company will not protect him."
In any case, Mr.
Flatow said, "20 months is an awfully long time to wait for the title policy, and the purchaser deserves to know more from his attorney than that he will get the policy 'sooner or later.' " At this point, he said, the purchaser should consider contacting the title company directly to determine the reason for the delay.
Unsold Shares In a Co-op Building Q What are unsold shares in a co-op building and why are they not subject to the co-op's subletting rules? . . .
Oscar L. Churn, Bronx.
A Morton H. Rosen, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in co-op and condominium law, said that unsold shares are shares of stock in a co-op housing corporation allocated to apartments that have never been purchased for residential purposes.
In the most common situation, the original sponsor is the holder of unsold shares for apartments that have not yet been sold.
"Virtually every cooperative offering plan exempts holders of unsold shares from various aspects of board regulation," Mr.
Rosen said.
As a result, he said, holders of unsold shares are typically exempted from subletting fees and policies, admissions policies, payment of flip taxes and transfer fees and board review of some proposed alterations.
In addition, he said, under the terms of some offering plans, the holders of unsold shares are given special voting rights in board elections and veto power over certain board actions.
Mr.
Rosen pointed out that any special rights or powers granted to holders of unsold shares result strictly from provisions in the offering plan.
"If the offering plan does not afford them these privileges, they do not exist," he said.

Police Link Algerian Militant Group to Paris Train Bombing
The police said today that there were signs that a group linked to the violent conflict in Algeria was responsible for the bombing of a commuter train in Paris on Tuesday that killed 7 people and injured more than 80.
Although they did not make a formal statement, police officials told reporters that they have a number of indications that the so-called Armed Islamic Group may be to blame.


Where Japan Deifies Its War Dead
ON the northern edge of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, just beyond the moat, is a vast stone walkway leading to one of Japan's most famous, most fascinating and, for Americans, most infuriating shrines.
The Yasukuni Shrine is the spot where Japanese soldiers who died in battle are worshiped as gods.
A focal point of Japanese nationalism, its extraordinary museum makes heroes of, among others, the young men who attacked Pearl Harbor, flew kamikaze planes and rampaged across Asia.

Why Lose Chance to Debate in Singapore?
To the Editor:
I conveyed through your columns Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's invitation to William Safire to debate Mr.
Goh at the National University of Singapore (letter, July 20).
Mr.

Goh to debate Francis Seow.


Women Say China Stalls On Parley
One month before the Fourth International Conference on Women is due to open in Beijing, thousands of official delegates and representatives of independent organizations say they have been unable to obtain visas and fear that China is effectively barring them from the event by setting up bureaucratic barriers.
The official conference and a parallel forum for nongovernmental organizations have been mired for months in problems with the Chinese Government.
Between them, the two events are expected to draw as many as 50,000 people, the largest international gathering ever held by the United Nations.


If It's This Hot, Can Fall Be Far Behind?
Last chance to fertilize the roses.
Doing it later is a no-no, because the new growth won't have time to harden off before it gets cold.

In the Region/Connecticut;
IN spite of a 15 to 20 percent decline in law school applications and a marked decrease in demand for graduates at downsized law firms and corporations, Connecticut's three law schools are engaged in sizable building projects.
The most ambitious new project is the 130,000-square-foot, $25 million complex at Quinnipiac College in Hamden that is now getting its finishing touches.
Classes for the fall semester are scheduled to begin Aug. 28.

Women Who Burn, Run, Jump And Slide For a Living
AS A RULE, LINDA HOWARD likes to be set on fire.
But she is also partial to car crashes, and feels quite comfortable falling out of windows.
As president of the Stuntwomen's Association of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles, she shares this passion with 26 other women who double for Whoopi Goldberg, Kathleen Turner, Betty White and hundreds of other actresses in everything from frightening car crashes to simple hair pulling.
Sometimes, they need only do a quick fall before picking up their checks and heading home.
But other times, a film is full of perilous action.


Casillas to Undergo Surgery
After enduring sciatic pain in his leg since last season, left tackle Tony Casillas decided today to have surgery for a herniated disk that he hoped would allow him to return in two months.
If he returns by then, he would miss four regular-season Jets games.
Casillas was to be a cornerstone of a revamped defensive line.
He has been one of the league's most powerful inside players in creating a surge -- a tactic that could have had a tremendous impact with the addition of the Jets' first-round rookie pass rusher, Hugh Douglas.


Jane S. Allen, Bradley C. Bowton

Quietness Argument For Sub Won't Wash
To the Editor:
I have a lot of respect for Secretary of the Navy John Dalton; I hate to see him fall prey to the sharks who are trying to justify the spending of $1.5 billion for the third Seawolf submarine (letter, July 24).


TRACK AND FIELD
Hours after Ivan Pedroso of Cuba set a world record of 29 feet 4 3/4 inches in the long jump in Sestriere, Italy, Carl Lewis strained his left hamstring today while winning the event at the United States Olympic Festival.
Lewis said he did not know if the injury would let him compete against Pedroso in the world track and field championships, which begin Friday in Goteborg, Sweden.
His only event there is the long jump on Aug. 11, meaning he has almost two weeks to become sound.


Eva Peron's Corpse Continues to Haunt Argentina
A new novel about Eva Duarte de Peron, which deals with the struggle over her remains after she died more than 40 years ago, has added to the fascination about her in a country with a long history of preoccupation with the dead.
Wife of the strongman Juan Domingo Peron, she was a champion of the poor until her death from cancer in 1952 at the age of 33.
Her life was celebrated in the Broadway musical "Evita."


In Sluggish Thrall of Summer, Nightclubs Serve Up Froth
Perched tentatively at the top of the stairs, Girly -- her nom de guerre in club land -- dipped her ankles into a vat of suds and debated whether to take the next step down.
Her outfit, resilient black vinyl, was tailor-made for the plunge.
Her braids, held in place by pastel barrettes, were drawn tightly enough to stay plastered in place.
Her mascara would undoubtedly fall victim, but, she concluded, her dignity would not.

Terror Trial Has Defense Calling Foul, Saying Tapes Are Proof of Fabrication
For six months, lawyers for 11 men charged in a terror-bombing conspiracy in New York have told a jury that their clients are the targets of a trumped-up case.
Last week, the lawyers presented what they said was the most important evidence of this: a conversation in which a Federal agent told an informer he was permitted to make unauthorized recordings of the men now charged.
The lawyers also presented statements that the agent made to her supervisors in which, the lawyers said, the agent lied about her knowledge of the informer's taping of the defendants for his private use.


Quiet Foursome, or Animal House?
Marian J. Fallon's colleagues call her the summer rental queen of the Jersey Shore.
She's been doing it since 1984; this summer her agency handled more than 50 group rentals in Spring Lake and Sea Girt.
But she really had to think when she was asked for a horror story.
"I did have six young men, while they were in college," she said.
"I had been renting to them for about three years, and jokingly told them to invite me to their Fourth of July party. Well, they did. And I saw. They had a white Volkswagen full of dirty laundry. That was their laundry hamper! I guess they took it home to their mothers at the end of the summer."


Acrid Bile
To the Editor:
Why on earth did you select John Mortimer to review "The Path to Power," by Margaret Thatcher (July 9)?
Since he is a lifetime socialist commenting on a book whose author declares herself a lifetime Conservative, I suppose he might have been expected to give the case for the opposition.
However, he is a man whose ability to comment on contemporary politics has dissolved in his own acrid bile.


The Experiments of Dr. Oz
JOYCE DONADIO HAD ARRIVED AT THE confluence of paradigms.
She was a 49-year-old, diabetic computer operator from Nutley, N. J., with a lifelong smoking habit and a blood-starved left ventricle.
The extremity of her condition had been driven home a week earlier by a crashing heart attack.
She was wheeled into Operating Room 21 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center at 7:30 A.M.
For the next eight hours her life was in the hands of blue-and-green-gowned nurses, physician-assistants, anesthesiologists and surgeons of various rank and experience who cut veins out of her legs, sawed her sternum in half, spread her ribs and then made way for Dr.
Mehmet Oz, probably the most accomplished 35-year-old cardiothoracic surgeon in the country.
He strode into the arena in his rubber clogs, hands upraised, ready for a sterile towel, latex gloves and the delicate work of securing a future for Donadio's faltering heart.
At the invitation of Oz and his patient, there were two other people on hand in surgical gowns and masks: a second-year medical student named Sally Smith, stationed at Donadio's feet, and a 52-year-old healer named Julie Motz, who was standing at Donadio's head.
As volunteers in Oz's Cardiac Complementary Care Center, they worked for free through the operation, seldom moving except to reposition their hands.
As Oz requested sutures and clamps and units of lidocaine, Motz called softly to Smith to move her hands from the small toe of Donadio's right foot to a point on the sole known as "the bubbling spring."


Baseball Needs Ripken to Take A Day Off
If Cal Ripken Jr. has any class -- and we've been led to believe that Cal is one class act -- he will take a day off between now and Sept. 6 when he is expected to break Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130 consecutive baseball games.
Cal will simply sit one out.


Kiri's Clown Surprises By Holding the Lead
Kiri's Clown, a 6-year-old horse who likes to come busting out of the gate to take the lead and try to hold it, came busting out today and did hold it.
And by the length of his neck, against a late rush by Awad, he scored a resounding upset to win the $250,000 Sword Dancer Invitational on the Saratoga turf.
Not only that, but he broke Fraise's track record of 1992 by two-fifths of a second, running the mile and a half on the inner turf course in 2:252/5 .
He also broke the losing streak of his trainer, Phil Johnson, who hadn't saddled a winner in New York State in 68 races going back to April.
In between, though, Kiri's Clown traveled to New England in June and won the New Hampshire Sweepstakes.


Where the Mississippi Begins
THE mighty river that changed so many lives and landscapes in the summer of 1993 begins un assumingly enough as a bright little stream rushing out of a tranquil lake fringed with wild rice in central Minnesota.
For 150 years the river's humble beginnings -- and the fact that it flows north and east for miles before curving southward -- fooled the region's European and American explorers, who claimed several other lakes as the headwaters before confirming what the Sioux and Ojibway had known for centuries: that the Y-shaped lake later named Itasca (from the Latin words veritas and caput, for truth and head) fed the river that had come to be known as the Great River, Father of Waters -- the Mississippi.
Now enclosed in 32,000 acres of protected land, Itasca State Park remains open to visitors all year, though the food, lodging, and boat and bicycle rental facilities close for the winter.
The park draws more than half a million visitors a year to view the headwaters site and touch the waters that flow 2,552 miles to the Gulf of Mexico.
In a clearing at the northern tip of Lake Itasca, a simple wooden marker identifies the beginning of this historic waterway: a tiny outlet where the lakes and creeks of the Itasca basin merge in what can -- in compliance with historical and geographical precedent -- be deemed a river.


Suzzara Chace, John Durocher
Suzzara Freeborn Chace, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

The Rev.
Harry Giroux performed the ceremony at St.
Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Ridgefield, Conn.
Mrs.
Durocher, 24, teaches and coaches at the Brimmer and May School in Brookline, Mass.
She is also a counselor at Riverside Community Care, a residential mental-health program in Dedham, Mass.
She graduated from Brown University.
She is to begin studying for a master's degree in education at Lesley College in the fall.


Medicare, to Survive, Needs an Affluence Test
To the Editor:
"A Bold, Imperfect Medicare Plan" (editorial, July 25) assesses Medicare's near-insolvent condition, as well as the disproportionate cost-cutting burden it faces in the Republican balanced budget plan.


New Face in the Urban Jungle
THOSE funny faces staring back at you in the Central Park Zoo's rain forest exhibit are the city's latest addition to its urban jungle: four black lion tamarin monkeys, among the world's rarest primates.
The adult tamarins, two males and two females, were born in Brazilian zoos and arrived last week at the Central Park Wildlife Center/Zoo, which is the first North American zoological park to join international conservation efforts to save this species.
But the zoo isn't taking all the credit.


THAT 'CERTAIN AGE'
A footnote to William Safire's useful scrutiny of euphemism and aging ("That 'Certain Age,' " July 2).
In France, men are sometimes labeled vieux or age, but in polite circles women never get old.
Once past infancy, a girl remains tout jeune (very young) until adolescence and early 20's when she becomes une jeune fille (a young girl).
In her 30's she is encore jeune (still young); in her 40's jeune toujours (young as ever).
At 80, a woman can relax totally because she is now eternellement jeune.

The Garbage Wars: Cracking the Cartel
LIKE armored divisions clashing on the battlefield, two garbage trucks from Browning-Ferris Industries and three from the Pioneer Carting Corporation confronted each other shortly after midnight two months ago in front of the Delmonico Gourmet Food Market in midtown Manhattan.
The trucks jammed Lexington Avenue, blocking traffic.
"You think you guys can control this city?" yelled one of the Pioneer drivers, jumping down from his seat, waving his arms and spouting language that matched the contents of his truck.
"This is our town."


Shootings Fall As More Guns Stay at Home
Behind the 30 percent drop in murders and shootings reported in New York City this year is a startling development: drug dealers and gang members have apparently begun to leave their guns at home.
Police Department and Federal law enforcement officials say that gunplay has decreased from the South Bronx to the Rockaways partly through the tightening of local and Federal gun-control regulations and crackdowns on youth gangs.
But more than anything else, Federal and local officials say, it is the increase in police friskings for such minor violations as loud radio playing and public beer drinking that has discouraged people from carrying unregistered guns.


July 23-29: A Tact for Labor; Three Unions Agree To Merge Into One
Having fallen on hard times, America's labor movement has seen its membership shrink, blue-collar wages fall and both Republicans and Democrats reject every hot item on its agenda -- from the North American Free Trade Agreement to universal health care.
Last week, three unions tried to recoup their power by merging.
Leaders for machinists, automobile workers and steelworkers said the process would take five years, but with 2 million, mostly well-paid members, the new union could be the nation's biggest and richest.

David in Battle With a Bookstore Goliath
Ever since Barnes &amp; Noble opened a megastore on Broadway at 82d Street in 1993, book lovers have wondered whether the Shakespeare &amp; Company bookstore, just one block south, could survive.
It has, but not without some setbacks, and not without some major changes in its marketing strategy.
Business has stabilized, company officials say, and the store is in the black.
Shakespeare has even taken a leaf from the Barnes &amp; Noble book by creating a mini-chain of its own.
In addition to its branch at 716 Broadway in Greenwich Village, the company plans to open a store this fall at 939 Lexington Avenue near 69th Street.

Advice for a Rock Band: Stay Away From the Clubs
To the Editor:
As a rock musician who has been a partner in a record company, I found the July 23 article "The Life and Times of a Young Rock Band" yet another example of how these bands defeat their own goals and objectives at the square one level.
A simple study of rock music's commercial and social traditions reveals the golden rule missing from the "curriculum" accompanying the article: Know thy audience.

Pest Control? Don't Count on It
Bat houses have been touted by some as nature's bug-zappers: put one up in your yard and watch the mosquitoes disappear.
But while experts agree that bats are completely beneficial to humans, they probably will not solve your mosquito problems.
A bat is capable of eating 600 mosquitoes an hour, but only under optimal conditions.


New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks
THE COLD WAR: A History By Martin Walker.
John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $14.
The author looks back on the conflict with some nostalgia: it helped maintain global stability, he argues, and encouraged economic growth.
"With lively prose and well-chosen anecdotes, he deftly traverses a half-century," David Callahan said here last year.
THE COLLECTED STORIES By Grace Paley.
Noonday/Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $14.
Moments of recognition, love, remembrance and regret fill these 45 stories, which span more than 25 years in the author's career.
The characters, often Jewish New Yorkers, are revealed mostly through dialogue, recorded with an unfailing ear for the vagaries of self-expression.
Ms.
Paley's "distinctive, sure-footed command of the short-story form brings to fictional material a quality that must be called poetry," our reviewer, Robert Pinsky, wrote in 1994.
He added, "By this I mean not mere verbal sauce . . . but the ability of language to dance with playful, lordly authority about the contours of reality."


'Forget Paris' Is Forgotten, as a Theater Goes Indian
The Gramercy Theater is still called the Gramercy Theater.
But the old-fashioned single-screen cinema on 23d, west of Lexington, which lay dormant for a year and a half in an industry gripped by multiplex mania, has a new identity that is making one immigrant community literally applaud.


Sidewalk Cafes Combat The City's Suburbanization

As the spokeswoman for the Second Avenue Merchants Association, I beg to differ with Kate Walter's indictment of outdoor cafes in the July 2 Soapbox essay "A Pox on Their Sidewalk Tables."


Tales From the Sky
FROM where Frank Kind works, sidewalks look like gray chalk lines, billboards are the size of postcards and Central Park is a tidy mosaic of bonsai trees and bushes.
When he is perched on a scaffold 45 floors above the cement sidewalk, Mr.

And he never looks down.
"I just pay attention," he said, "to what I'm doing."


Little Russian Affluence
To the Editor:
Re "To Be Young, Russian and Middle Class" (front page, July 23): The entrepreneurs you describe are exceptions.
Most middle-class Russians are struggling to survive.
White-collar workers, as well as professors, physicists, doctors, have less money to spend than an immigrant worker in the United States.


Asking for a Raise, and Finding Enlightenment
When The New York Times asked readers about requesting a raise, many respondents told of deft and funny sidestepping by the boss.
But others talked more seriously -- about the human poignancy of this workplace ritual, the virtues of self-assertion, the hidden benefits of failure.
Here, a selection:
Granted or denied, a request for a raise often results in a valuable insight.


ON THE BORDER OF LIFE
I was born on Nov. 10, 1975, weighing 800 grams (less than 2 pounds), after only 26 weeks.
Fortunately, I lived through the next three and a half months in Babies 12, the newborn intensive care unit of New York City's Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.
When I look at photos, it's still hard for me to believe that the scrawny, brownish-red bundle in the incubator was actually me.


Bloopers Start Off New Yanks With Smiles
The attention was supposed to be on David Cone and Ruben Sierra, the two players who made their Yankee debuts tonight and have been challenged with helping them seize control of the American League East race.
While Cone's awesome pitching snatched a significant portion of the spotlight, some of the focus was reserved for Minnesota's Rich Becker and his losing skirmish with the Metrodome's tricky white ceiling.
If a bewildered Becker had not lost Mike Stanley's towering fly ball to center field with the bases loaded in the fourth inning, Cone's initial start for the Yankees might have been a setback.
But Becker's abominable misplay on his home field allowed three tainted runs to score, and catcher Matt Walbeck's inexplicable failure to cover the plate in the seventh added another tarnished run and enabled the Yankees to toast their new arrivals in a 4-2 victory.


For the Record/The Pork Barrel; Watch Out With That Budget Ax. My District NEEDS Than Dam.
For four decades, the Democrats who ruled Congress larded Federal spending bills with pork.
Locks, dams, people-movers, Federal research centers, passenger rail lines, electric buses, airport control towers, highway "demonstration projects" and Lord knows what else rained from Washington like inflation-adjusted pennies from heaven.
Everybody on Capitol Hill got wet.
But Republicans got damp, while Democrats got soaked.
And the Democrats who dispensed the goodies -- those who sat on Congress's appropriations and authorizing committees -- were so flooded that they needed dams, which, fortunately, they were in a position to finance.


F.Y.I.
The Ear of the Beholder Q.  Where did Aqueduct race track get its name?
Belmont is named for August Belmont, who founded that track, and Saratoga is named after Saratoga Springs, the upstate town where the track is located.
But isn't Aqueduct a strange name?
A.
Actually, Aqueduct got its name the same way Saratoga did.
When it opened, on Sept. 27, 1894, it was in an area known as Aqueduct.
And that was named because there was an aqueduct there.


Pricey, Gas-Guzzling Cars Face Double-Whammy on Taxes
THERE is little doubt that taxes affect everybody.
But for those who come and go in frivolously inefficient automobiles costing upward of $32,000, the Internal Revenue Service exacts two more penalties -- the gas-guzzler and luxury taxes.
The gas-guzzler tax took effect in 1991 in order to penalize those vehicles deemed by the Environmental Protection Agency as not frugal enough at the pump.
The tax rate ranges between $1,000 and $7,700, depending on a vehicle's average fuel economy as calculated by the E.P.A.
The tax is added into the transaction price of a new car.
Strangely, the gas-guzzler tax is not assessed on sport utility vehicles or light trucks, which are typically less miserly than cars.
The tax generated $65.6 million in revenue during the Government's fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 1994.


Correction
A brief article on July 16 about the restoration of the Kitano Hotel on Park Avenue at 38th Street misspelled the names of the design firm and omitted the name of the architect.
The designer is Chhada, Siembieda &amp; Partners; the architectural firm is FMA.


Upscale And Kosher On East 12th
"See, he just did a double take," said Tamar Elberg, pointing to a man strolling by her brother's seven-month-old restaurant.
"They do that a lot. We're out of our element."
She and her brother, Ruben Elberg, are followers of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the late spiritual leader known as "the Rebbe" to more than 200,000 Lubavitch Hasidim worldwide.
And Ms.
Elberg is right, the Kosher Tea Room, an upscale full-service restaurant at 12th Street and Second Avenue, is a head-turner.


THE SUPPER CLUB
That there are affluent and accomplished women who disguise their healthy appetites for the approval of men filled me with rage and contempt (Style: "The Supper Club," by Holly Brubach, July 9).
And that their "remarkable" (hello?) male friend felt he had to offer a veiled apology for his "plump" partner is as bad or maybe worse.


Make 'em Laugh!
BAH-BOOM!
The drummer in the four-piece band does a rim shot.
Cozy Morley, comedian, straps on a banjo.
"My dear mother got this for me," he tells the 200 or so people packed into Viva's Lounge in Trump's Castle on a Saturday evening.
"I remember us standing outside the window of a pawnshop in South Philadelphia. We were poor, but we were proud. My mother says, 'Are you sure that this is what you want?' I said, 'Yes, Mom, this is what I want.' So she picked up a rock . . ."


Gestation Revelations
THIS is my third time around being a giant pregnant woman in the city.
And even as the weather turns hostile and tempers start to fray, there's a sort of bubble I get to live in for the three or four months when everyone is aware that I'm walking, riding, hailing for two.
I am transformed from a mere face in the crowd to a big stomach in the way, requiring consideration and comment.
I must say I enjoy the drama, as well as the thrill of influencing, however minutely and temporarily, an otherwise obstinate, intractable city.
It sustains me for the time being, even though I know that, once the baby is born, the same people will cease to care.
Cars and trucks will hit the brakes for a pregnant woman crossing the street, but a few months later when the same woman pushes a carriage through the same crosswalk, forget it.

Nude Cabaret Will Stay Open
After a brief brush with bankruptcy, Wiggles, a cabaret that features naked dancers, has reached a tentative agreement with its landlord, the club's major creditor, and will remain open -- much to the chagrin of its many neighborhood foes.
A lawyer for Wiggles said last week that the club, a target of protests since it opened a year ago, had yet to turn a profit.
But the lawyer, Andrew D. Presberg, said that the bankruptcy filing had been a maneuver to prevent the landlord from seizing the club's assets.


Resource for Women Burdened by Infertility
SUE M. is 38 and doesn't feel normal.
The sight of babies and pregnant women makes her cry.
She avoids passing through baby sections in department stores.
She has stopped going to the local pool.
"I would get really depressed," Mrs.
M. said.
"A lot of the people who went there were mothers with children."


On Politics; Bradley a Wallflower? Don't Be Too Sure
Will he or won't he?
Of course he will.
But just because the Republicans are spoiling for a fight, 18 months before the election, doesn't mean that Senator Bill Bradley has to step through the ropes.
This logic has hardly dampened a sly campaign by Washington Republicans to portray New Jersey's senior Senator as a wallflower in the run-up to the November 1996 election for the seat he holds.


July 23-29; The Wobbly Ideal Called Perfection
THE French novelist Emile Zola once declared that he was "little concerned with perfection." American high school students suddenly have the luxury of feeling the same way: it is now possible to miss three or four questions on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and still achieve a perfect score.

She graduated from Smith College.
Her father is a senior loan consultant at Home Savings of America in White Plains.
Her mother is the office manager for the director of gynecologic oncology at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York.


The World; The South American Art of Name-Calling
LATIN America isn't, as it is often portrayed in the United States, just one civilization artificially divided into different countries.
Listen to the chants at soccer stadiums around South America, and you'll hear what Latin Americans really think about each other.
At the recent America Cup tournament in Uruguay, Argentine fans belittled their Chilean counterparts as "sons of Pinochet" (translation: Chile is full of militarists).
The Argentines, who are predominantly white, also urged their team on against the "dirty blacks from Brazil" (the country with the largest black population on the continent).


True Tales From the Night Of the Living Hamptons
SOUTHAMPTON, L.I. -- "I've always felt that a face is a road map of a life," Chuck Close was saying.
"Laugh lines, tears -- the indications are always there."
Mr.
Close was at the opening of "Face Value: American Portraits" at the Parrish Art Museum on July 22.
"It's sad to see how many people in this show are dead," he said as he stopped in front of his portrait of an old woman with glimmering eyes, flyaway hair and a measured smile.


World News Briefs; Spanish Court Is Asked To Investigate Premier
An investigating magistrate has petitioned Spain's Supreme Court to investigate Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez as "the founder and leader" of the organization behind death squads that carried out a "dirty war" against Basque separatists in the 1980's.
The magistrate, Baltazar Garzon, who has been investigating the death squads since December, argues in a report that he found evidence that Mr.
Gonzalez and three Socialist Party members of Parliament were behind the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, which killed 27 people between 1984 and 1987 in southern France.


The Rainbow That Is Rome
MY appreciation for Roman light started with a night of insomnia shortly after I had moved into an apartment with a view of the Colosseum.
I watched the rising sun color the arena like a cartoon paintbrush plying between the lines of a black-and-white sketch.
The normal grays and dirty whites of the Colosseum's ancient travertine blocks exploded suddenly into a warm flush of pinks and reds as the sun came up behind my back.
It was a fleeting makeover, lasting perhaps 10 minutes, but grand enough that I deliberately stationed myself at the French doors every now and again at sunrise just to see the Colosseum blush.


IN SHORT: FICTION
THE GARLIC BALLADS  By Mo Yan. Viking, $23.95.
Mo Yan's novel "The Garlic Ballads" can make a reader squirm at the frozen soul of totalitarian bureaucracy.
Unfortunately, the peasants struggling here against the system of agricultural collectivization aren't quite as interesting as the system itself.
It is the old story -- as venerated in Chinese Communist propaganda as in secular myth -- of the hardscrabble farming village rising up against its overlords.
The drama, as translated by Howard Goldblatt, is acted by an ensemble cast that includes Zhang Kou, a blind minstrel whose ballads tie together the cleverly disjointed narrative; Gao Ma, a cynical former soldier; Jinju, the young woman he wishes to marry; and Jinju's parents and two brothers, a family that achieves new heights of dysfunction.
Jinju and Gao Ma are so hard-working and headstrong that we know they aren't long for this world; as a result, it's difficult to care about them.
More memorable is Gao Ma's neighbor, Gao Yang, who seethes with hatred for the state yet is so programmed by it that the sound of a firm voice -- be it that of an official or a common criminal -- is all it takes for him to subject himself without complaint to the greatest humiliations.
The psychological grip of Communist indoctrination is a theme the author fails to take very far; instead he needlessly manipulates our sympathies by giving Gao Yang a blind daughter and a pregnant wife.
Mo Yan's strength is in showing the utter hopelessness and subjugation of life under Communism.
This is perhaps best demonstrated by the most humane public official in the book, a doctor at an obstetrical clinic.
"Do you have a heart of stone?" she asks a man who is upset that his wife has borne him a daughter.
"Take your baby home and treat her well. When she's 18 you can get at least 10,000 for her." TOBIN HARSHAW

Cuban Breaks Long-Jump Record
They have run into each other all summer, at track meets and in hotel lobbies, and though Mike Powell does not speak Spanish and Ivan Pedroso does not speak English, the two long jumpers have built a bond that transcends the unspoken word.
"He's such a nice guy, and that's a problem," Powell said earlier this month after losing to the Cuban in a meet in Lausanne, Switzerland.
"I can't get any energy from him, any rage. I can't go grrrrrrrr."


A Bubble Grows Ever Bigger
So much for that collapse of technology stocks.
Last week the Philadelphia stock exchange index of semiconductor stocks set three record highs.
Even with a dip on Friday, the index is up 103 percent for 1995.
The previous week's plunge of more than 10 percent in a couple of hours is almost forgotten.

A Cherished Roadside Symbol of the Region
WHEN chronicling life inside the Big Duck, the chronicler quickly learns a vital fowl fact.
There is no bathroom in the Big Duck.
That could present a challenge to some people, but not to the Duck Lady, as Barbara Bixby of Riverhead likes to call herself.
Ms.
Bixby spends her days inside Suffolk's most unusual landmark, selling "duck-abilia."


QUICK BITES: Morristown; Indulging a Passion for the Finest Cheese
Just back from Paris, my husband yearned for French cheese, and he knew exactly where to go: La Bakerie, the bistro-bakery of Jean Paul Grasmuck, a native of the Lorraine region of France.
Mr.
Grasmuck loves cheeses.
"Cheese is a sensitive chord in my heart," he said.
"Since a little corner in my display case is all the space I have for cheese, it might as well be the best."


An Artist Who Gives Houses a Magic Touch
THE Westchester artist Regi Klein is almost famous.
She is well known locally, but not in the larger world.
This will surprise many Westchester, Fairfield and Berkshire residents who happily stumble on one of her whimsical portraits of private homes or historical buildings and immediately identify the artist.
Local cognoscenti may admire her colorful and clever renderings hung above fireplaces in fashionable homes.
Or they may spot one of her works hanging in the Westchester County Courthouse, in the Putnam Trust Bank in Greenwich or in the Red Lion Inn in Stockbridge, Mass., and feel a spark of recognition.


Curtain Raisers In the West 40's
CAFE UN DEUX TROIS *  (212) 354-4148; 123 West 44th Street; $$; all major credit cards
The atmosphere here is as close as you will get to a fashionably threadbare and lively French brasserie, and the simple bistro cooking remains reliably satisfying.
The short, straightforward menu includes starters of country pate, ravioli Provencal, baked snails in garlic butter and a mixed green salad with a good vinaigrette.
Among the main courses are a nicely done charred steak with pommes frites; steak tartare with a piquant taste of Tabasco, also served with fries; warm roasted chicken; calf's liver served with grilled onions, and your choice of omelets.
For dessert, creme caramel and profiteroles are both good. (Review: 4/5/91; revisited: 6/2/95)  CARMINE'S *  (212) 221-3800; 200 West 44th Street; $; American Express
With its sand-colored walls festooned with publicity photos, whirling fans overhead and neighborly tables, Carmine's dining room looks as if it has been around since vaudeville days.
The kitchen turns out a pleasing mix, essentially Neapolitan, with everything served family style.
Pizettes, or little pizzas, are a good way to begin.
Toppings change daily and might include fennel sausage, tomato, garlic and mozzarella.
Other pleasing starters are the enormous plate of fried calamari served with a tomato dipping sauce, and a mixed salad platter combining greens, mozzarella, tomatoes and roasted peppers.
Popular entrees include rigatoni with sausage and broccoli in a ripe tomato sauce; porterhouse steak topped with an earthy sauce of tomatoes, sweet peppers and onions; grilled swordfish; a grilled pork chop and lobster fra diavolo with shrimp and clams in a spicy sauce over linguine. (Review: 9/25/92)  CHEZ JOSEPHINE **  (212) 594-1925; 414 West 42d Street; $$; all major credit cards
On any given night, this theatrical bistro rivals some of the most entertaining productions on and off Broadway.
You never know when someone will burst into song or hammer out show tunes on the piano.
The earthy bistro fare is prepared with care.
For starters, the Chinese ravioli with goat cheese and toasted pine nuts is always pleasing, as are baked snails in garlic butter, and salad of endive with crumbled Roquefort and walnuts.
This 27-year-old brick-walled tavern has always been known for its buoyant bar scene and simple American fare.
Framed Broadway posters and other theater memorabilia make up the decor, and the dining room is separated from the bar by brick arches.
Salads are a good way to begin, whether the sprightly assembly of grilled portobellos, tender spinach and sweet fennel or the generous plate of endive, watercress, Roquefort and walnuts tossed in a well-balanced vinaigrette.
Other starters include black bean soup, asparagus vinaigrette and fried chicken wings.
For main courses, the kitchen turns out a perfect calf's liver with steamed spinach and buttery whipped potatoes, nicely charred sirloin steak with crispy fries, grilled lamb chops with ratatouille, meatloaf with mashed potatoes and a good house burger. (Review: 8/19/88; revisited: 7/20/95)
LATTANZI *  (212) 315-0980; 361 West 46th Street; $$; American Express
A welcoming family-run restaurant in the heart of Restaurant Row, Lattanzi delivers fresh, tasty pasta and sprightly salads in a low-key setting.
One of the highlights is a menu featuring the cuisine from the ancient Jewish ghetto in Rome.
The best-known dish from that tradition is carciofi alla giudea, or tender artichokes sauteed with garlic and parsley.
Other good starters include a tasty shrimp and arugula salad vinaigrette and a combination plate of eggplant that is first fried then marinated in a sweet combination of vinegar, sugar, olive oil and tomatoes.
The plate also includes fresh mozzarella and suppli al telefono, a Roman specialty that is essentially a ball of mozzarella coated with a risottolike mixture, then rolled in bread crumbs and fried.
Recommended pastas include porcini ravioli, and herby linguine with white clam sauce.
Among the entrees are grilled lamb chops with rosemary and braised shanks of beef with polenta. (Review: 6/23/89; revisited: 7/17/95)  LE MADELEINE


July 23-29; Spa'am, a Boar (And a Boor) Riles Hormel
It's easy to laugh at Spam, that veritable bulwark of canned meat, but its maker, Hormel Food Corporation, was not amused when a wild boar named Spa'am appeared in a new Muppet film.
Last week Hormel slapped a trademark suit on the puppet's creator, Jim Henson Productions.
Hormel executives say it isn't just the identically pronounced name that upsets them.
The lawsuit describes the puppet as "a grotesque and noxious appearing wild boar" and accuses the puppeteers of "portraying the Spa'am character as evil in porcine form." The movie, "Muppet Treasure Island," which comes out in February, features the fearsome Spa'am, who leads a savage tribe of boars that worship Miss Piggy and terrify the hero Kermit.


Captain Learns the Subtleties of the Moon and Mahantswami
Driving past crates full of cuttlefish, water spinach and stringy gourds in downtown Flushing last December, when he became the commander of the 109th Precinct, Capt.
John McManus barely recognized the bustling area from his childhood memory of rundown streets and abandoned warehouses.
At age 42, after a brief stint as second-in-command at the 88th Precinct in Brooklyn, he was now in charge of one of the largest precincts in the city, and certainly its most culturally diverse -- a district sweeping over northeast Queens populated on the one hand by wealthy, predominantly white residents who demand prompt response, and on the other by new immigrants, many suspicious of the police.


On Sunday; One Customer Wrecks a Life Of Hard Work
SIX mornings a week, Hilal Mohammad beat sunrise to his Brooklyn garage.
He rolled up the gates, and then his sleeves.
This was America, and so anything was possible.
Nothing, though, was sweeter than a workload of seized engines, overheated radiators, cracked transmissions.
For the mechanic from Amman, there was magic to the monotony.
"I had no idea about America before I came," said Mr.
Mohammad, a 34-year-old native of Jordan.
"But my brother had told me it was good for mechanics."


'Vice Versa'
To the Editor:
What a baffling position Frank Kermode has taken on Marjorie Garber's learned and delectably readable "Vice Versa"!
He complains that her Harvard predecessor George Lyman Kittredge "couldn't even have imagined" the books she has devoured in researching her subject.
But Kittredge, who died around the time Ms.
Garber was born, couldn't even have imagined a female Harvard professor, let alone the way Shakespeare studies have become in the past two decades a forum for the exploration of every development in the field of literary theory.


Raise High the Roof Beam, City Dweller
THE HOME-IMPROVEMENT shows that tap into something deep in me begin at 9:30 every Saturday morning, then plod on earnestly for a couple of hours until, I imagine, homeowners across America are almost ready to take a lunch break from the real thing.
By that I mean the lawn mowing, roof fixing, shed building and other tasks that the home-improvement shows would have me doing if I had a lawn to mow, a roof to fix or a place to put a shed.
After lunch the shows retire for a while (nap time?), only to re-emerge in late afternoon, ready to go head to head with their cousin in exquisite suburban calm, golf.
That I know this programming schedule at all is what drives my theory about these how-to shows.
My theory is that among their biggest fans are city dwellers like me, people who live in brick and stone hives, who may pick up a hammer only when a picture frame falls off the wall but who nonetheless -- and maybe because of their urban constraints -- harbor a profound desire to add on a sun deck.


Streetscapes/Trees; In New York City, It's Not That Easy Being Green
WHY does a city of million-dollar apartments have dime-size street trees?
Take a walk on the shady side of the street and contemplate how carelessly we treat our struggling trees and how even those that receive the best of care face daunting prospects in a city where new tree plantings have a life expectancy of only 7 to 12 years.
"We've always had street trees in New York" is the universally accepted wisdom, but except for boulevards or streets adjacent to parks there was almost no street tree planting in the built-up sections from the mid-19th century until the 1930's.


False Tears Over Bosnia
When the Bosnian Serbs "cleansed" the "safe area" of Srebrenica of its Muslim inhabitants, cable TV viewers of the world set a standard of tolerance that will be hard to match.
With at most a 12-hour delay, Europeans again bore witness to an expulsion, the horrors of which can only be termed biblical.
Before or after a trip to the refrigerator, or even to the beach, we heard mothers tell of how their daughters were pulled off buses by Serb soldiers and never seen again; we heard stories of heads on stakes, dismembered children, mass suicides.


Beth Anderson, Rusty Harold
Beth Anderson, a composer, and Elliotte Harold 3d, a computer specialist and author, were married on Friday at the Municipal Building in New York.
Mrs.

POSTINGS: Cost of Environmental Cleanup Is Cited; N.Y.U. Ends Plan For Jersey Field
New York University has canceled plans to build a $4 million, 10-acre athletic complex in Weehawken, N.J.
One of the main factors the university cited was environmental costs.
The site is contaminated with chromium, but the levels are not so high that the clean-up costs would be borne by the Federal Government, as N.Y.U. officials had hoped.
Costs were also rising for the project, officials said, and the university's priorities have changed over the last three years.
"It was going to be much more expensive than we thought, and we are very disappointed," said Virgil Renzulli, N.Y.U.'s director of public affairs.
N.Y.U's decision not to go ahead with the project was first reported in The Weehawken Reporter, a weekly newspaper, last week.

History On and Off The Field In Canton
Only 180 men have been named among the greatest ambassadors of pro football.
The 180 are those enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
In most cases, each inductee has given as much to the game as he has received.
The five men inducted on the Hall's steps under sparkling sunshine this afternoon strengthened that tradition.

Worst Blight Since Ireland's Is Chilling Potato Farmers
A perverse sort of historical symmetry is at work in Murray Mahany's potato fields.
Almost 150 years after the potato blight drove his great-great-grandfather out of Ireland, a virulent new cousin of the same disease is threatening to drive him out of the only business he has ever known.

Croatia Presses Offensive Against Serbs
Pressing a new offensive, Croatian forces that have been on the march inside Bosnia shelled territory in Croatia held by rebel Serbs overnight and showed no inclination to heed United Nations appeals for restraint, United Nations officials here said today.
The Croatian advance northward from an area along Bosnia's western border with Croatia has broadened the Balkan strife and raised speculation that Croatian forces may be on the brink of a major drive to regain territory occupied by Serbs in Croatia during the 1991 civil war here.
The Serbs call the area Krajina.


Alissa Wall, Marc Berger
Alissa Gabrielle Wall, the daughter of Carol L. Bassin of New York and Stephen J. Wall of Norwalk, Conn., was married last evening to Marc Stuart Berger, a son of Rochelle and Michael Berger of West Nyack, N.Y.

Mrs.
Berger, 24, graduated from Boston University.
Until recently, she was a window display artist at Bloomingdale's in New York.
Her father is the president of Manus Associates, a management consulting company in Stamford, Conn.


On Columbia's Brick Walkways, Safety vs. History
Is great architecture in the details?
Preservationists who are angry at Columbia University for rebuilding some brick walkways think so.
Charles McKim of McKim, Mead &amp; White planned Columbia University in the 1890's, he designed walkways of hand-made brick to connect classrooms, laboratories and offices.
But Columbia is currently repaving the now uneven walkways, using bricks that are shorter, narrower, rougher and a brighter red.


New England Dairy Compact Benefits Farmers and Consumers
To the Editor:
"Milking Consumers" (editorial, July 22) creates the illusion that passage of an interstate dairy compact will hurt consumers, "fattening the bank accounts of a few nearby farmers," and that the compact itself is unconstitutional.

At the End of Their Rope
Two great social movements have come together in San Dimas, Calif., with the confluence of bungee jumping and the water theme park.
Raging Waters, about 15 miles east of Pasadena off I-210, has installed a bungee-jumping tower, 138 feet high, over its million-gallon wave pool, and for $30 a jump, visitors can bob to within 10 feet of the water, like lures at the ends of giant fishing poles.
For information, call (909) 592-6453.


Jennifer L. Sachs, Paul A. Slager

Frederick Lee Sachs of Woodbridge, Conn., was married yesterday to Paul Alan Slager, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Lawrence A. Slager of Grand Rapids, Mich.
The Rev.
Richard Doeden, a minister of the Reform Church of America, performed the ceremony with Rabbi Charles Lippman at the Battell Chapel in New Haven.
The bride, 29, is a law clerk to Judge Walter J. Cummings of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago.
She graduated summa cum laude from Yale University and received her law degree from Stanford University.
Her father is the associate chief of staff and chief of the department of internal medicine at Yale-New Haven Hospital in New Haven.
Her mother, Ruth Rosen Sachs, is the advertising manager of the Yale University Press, also in New Haven.


Tour Fugitive
To the Editor:
After reading about Linda Wolfe's miserable experiences with her tour to Turkey, we'd like to recommend the truly wonderful tour group with whom we recently traveled.
We, too, normally don't go on tours, but Cultural Folk Tours of San Diego (800) 935-8875, is a special company.
Our guide was fascinating, informative and friendly; the food was delicious and the settings were quite pleasant, if not lovely.
Our group was terrific and we had ample time at each site.

More From Labor in New York
Every time Mayor Rudolph Giuliani leaps over a budget hurdle in his effort to get New York City's expenses under control, another obstacle seems to rise up.
A month ago, the Mayor and the city unions focused their energies on the budget, reaching an accord yielding hundreds of millions of dollars in savings.
Now they face a new round of negotiations, this time for new contracts involving wages and benefits.
These talks are likely to be the most important yet.
They will help determine whether Mr.
Giuliani can successfully manage government services in an era of diminished resources.


Habitats/Guilford, Conn.; Cottage of Her Dreams
IN 1973, when the rows of beige-stained condominiums with vertical siding were built around it, the tiny white cottage with the black shutters had been standing for decades; no one seems to know exactly how long.
When they were put up, the condominiums must have looked chic, a bit of California seaside architecture in this antique town; the cottage must have seemed unrelievedly dated and undoubtedly out of place.


Two Cranes and Deep Water Help Put Hum Back in a Troubles Port
The Brooklyn waterfront once hummed with activity as hundreds of longshoremen hauled freight each day from dozens of ships onto trains and trucks.
But in the last 30 years, most of that business fled to newer, more spacious piers in New Jersey.
In the last year the city's Economic Development Corporation moved two refurbished, 120-foot cranes from the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Sunset Park to the struggling Red Hook Marine Terminal, the only port in the city where cargo containers are unloaded from ships.
The agency also met with shipping companies to help Red Hook snare new contracts.


Sports of The Times; It Sounds As If Seles Is Back
NOT a grunt was heard from Monica Seles, not until eight games had passed.
That's when Seles was serving for the first set, and suddenly she began to emit a toned-down version of that glorious punctuation -- Uh hah -- to her two-fisted ground strokes.
Heavier around the waist, thicker in the thighs, out of tennis for 27 months, Seles looked understandably slow for a time yesterday against Martina Navratilova.
Then Seles broke serve and smelled blood.
As if on cue, she was right in step and back in tune.
Now 5 feet 11 inches tall, able to win more points outright on her first serve, Seles proceeded to storm through Navratilova, 6-3, 6-2.
Uh hah.
That's a champion with a killer instinct for you.


Behind Bars, a Girl Scout Troop Brings Mothers and Daughters Together
The bus ride from Newark was long and steamy, and when the girls reached their destination, they had to turn their pockets inside out and pass through a metal detector.
But by now, the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility is too familiar to frighten them.
It is the place their mothers call home.
Once a month, a group visits the prison, in Hunterdon County, for glimpses of parents they rarely see.
The reunions take the form of Girl Scout meetings, where mothers and daughters can savor each other's company and forget, however briefly, the prison walls that separate them.
Between games and songs, they trade gossip and emotional details of their lives.


2 Factories Raided in Federal Inquiry Into Defective Aircraft Parts
Two factories in western New York that make critical engine bearings for many of the nation's military aircraft were forced to shut down on Friday and yesterday as Federal agents moved in and seized thousands of documents in an investigation of charges that defective parts had been sold to the Government.
The company, MRC Bearings, also makes engine bearings for commercial aircraft.
But late yesterday, an official of the Federal Aviation Administration said in Washington that commercial airlines did not have parts with the bearings in question.


Q and A
Seeing Shaw in Canada
Q.
I want to go to the George Bernard Shaw Festival in Ontario, Canada this fall.

Commercial Property/Fifth Avenue in the 50's; As Troubles Ebb, It's Becoming The Avenue Again
OUTSIDE of New York, few people realized there had been a change.
Out there, a Fifth Avenue address still conjured up an image of an elegant street where an uninterrupted line of expensive stores like Tiffany blended with tourist-pleasers like St.
Patrick's Cathedral.
But recent reality has been far less pretty.
Over the last decade even Fifth Avenue in the 50's, the avenue's "best" -- translation: priciest -- section, has been splotched by electronics and rug stores.
High-fashion windows were eclipsed by seemingly permanent "going out of business" signs, and the ubiquitous street peddlers were turning the avenue into an obstacle course.

Ronald J. Ross of Gates Mills, Ohio.
Rabbi Max Hausen officiated at the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia.
Mrs.

She graduated from George Washington University and received a master's degree in early childhood education from the Bank Street College of Education.
Her father is the president of Universal Radiation Oncology Centers in King of Prussia, Pa.
Her mother is an artist in Philadelphia.


The World; In Japan, Chicken Little Lays the Golden Egg
" . . . and then in the fall of 1995, to cap an atrocious year for Japan, Mount Fuji erupted, covering Tokyo with lava and triggering a giant earthquake that sent the country's major islands sinking noislessly beneath the sea. . . ."
WELL, that hasn't happened yet.
But it would be a fitting follow-up in an Annus Horribilis that is deflating Japan in its own eyes and those of the world.

World Leaguer May Add Depth to Jets' Kicking Game
This is no summer-in-the-country camp for Jets kickers these days.
And Don Silvestri is no wide-eyed, just-happy-to-be-here place-kicker who wouldn't dream of trying to horn in on a legend.
Indeed, the Jets have brought in the left-footed graduate of the World League's London Monarchs because they hope to augment the exquisitely accurate kicking game of Nick Lowery, Hall-of-Famer-in-waiting, with someone who has more pop in his leg.


IN SHORT: FICTION
LIVING OTHER LIVES  By Caroline Leavitt. Warner, $21.95.
Caroline Leavitt's sixth novel showcases her ability to create believable characters who can behave badly without forfeiting the reader's sympathy.
When Lilly's fiance, Matt, is killed in a freak accident, she is too grief-stricken to pay proper attention to the sullen bids for attention of Matt's now-orphaned daughter, Dinah.
She does, however, reluctantly assume responsibility for taking the teen-ager to Matt's mother, Dell, in Pittsburgh.
Dell, who had held herself aloof from her son, determines to make up for it with Dinah, but the girl is too angry to be very responsive.
The straightforward, old-fashioned narration of "Living Other Lives" dips in and out of its characters' thoughts to reveal confused but basically good people who desperately want to be loved, without having much idea how to go about it.
The novel modestly aims to reward these appealing individuals with happiness after an appropriate number of trials, and it succeeds, although the story might have more staying power if it had a bit more edge.
Still, "Living Other Lives" is warmhearted without being saccharine, a delicate balancing act that Ms.
Leavitt pulls off with aplomb.

Credit Cards And Rental Cars
IT'S time for auto renters to take a fresh look at the small type describing collision-damage waivers or the credit-card benefit that circumvents them.
There haven't been major changes since a raft of them went through in 1993, but there have been enough small ones to cause confusion.
One area of confusion has resulted from the popularity of four-wheel-drives, vans and sporty cars.
My friend Rita rented a four-wheel-drive Suzuki Sidekick from an independent agency in New Jersey for a trip to the Adirondacks in February.
She told the agent she did not want the collision-damage waiver, which relieves the renter of repair costs to the car in the event of an accident, because she was charging the rental to her American Express card, which provides this coverage as a benefit.
The agent said that American Express would not cover the Sidekick, and insisted that Rita buy the waiver, with a $1,500 deductible, at $15 a day, or $105 for a week's rental.
Unsure and concerned about conditions in the mountains, she complied.
She had to sign a pledge not to drive the car off the road.


Vanguard? Visionary? Neither, Nor
AT THE HEART OF JOHN ADAMS'S NEW musical theater work "I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky," which received its first New York performances as part of the Lincoln Center Serious Fun festival recently, a young black man is brought to trial.
Lest there be any confusion about how this event is to be regarded, a piece of authentic Los Angeles graffiti art is on display, showing a grotesque white judge with an enormous swastika above his head, looming over an American flag with more swastikas instead of stars.
The audience is meant to nod approvingly.
A radical Vietnamese-American lawyer pleads for his client in this supposedly Nazi court.
"As you probably know," he says, "it's always open season on a young black man set up to fail." The defendant has already been imprisoned twice as the leader of a Los Angeles gang.
The earlier crimes are not explained, but now he has stolen two bottles of malt liquor from a convenience store, an act defended as a "cultural thing." After all, his girlfriend's baby had just been "stolen" by immigration officials; when she called him on his beeper, he didn't have time to wait in line to pay for the brew.


PHOTOGRAPHER'S JOURNAL


The Fast-Track Treadmill
To the Editor:
Your report on the Wharton study on the relationship between family priorities and income was misleading.
The study found that respondents, especially men, who had attached high importance to a good family life when they were high school seniors had higher earnings 14 years later than those for whom family had not been a priority.
From this, you concluded that the conventional wisdom about work-family conflicts and the need to work long hours to succeed may be incorrect.


Bugs? Often Enough, the Hose Is the Answer
THE recent hot weather plus a prolonged drought have left an ugly mark on the green world.
Lawns are browned off, trees are dropping leaves prematurely and mildew is rampant.
Certain specimen plants are dwarfs of their usual selves.
In many cases, flowering is either off schedule or not what it should be.
Many annuals are setting seed prematurely.
Hopefully the return of cooler weather and adequate rainfall will set things right again.
Meanwhile, hoses and watering cans have been put into yeoman service.


Asian Nations Putting Pressure on France Over Nuclear Tests
With France only weeks away from resuming nuclear tests in the Pacific, governments across Asia and the South Pacific are demanding that the French reconsider, and there are warnings of an economic boycott that could damage the French economy.
The most potent threat may come from Japan, where the Government has bitterly criticized the decision by President Jacques Chirac to resume nuclear testing in French Polynesia this fall after a three-year moratorium.
Mr.
Chirac says his decision is irrevocable.

A Longshot Wins Diners' Top Zagat Rating
A LONGSHOT has run away with top food ratings in the first stand-alone Zagat survey of Long Island.
Piccolo, a popular Northern Italian spot in Huntington, received the highest ranking in a survey of more than 2,000 diners who filled out questionnaires after they had visited a total of 530 restaurants.
They rated Mirabelle of St.
James second and the Mill River Inn of Oyster Bay third.
Piccolo, which received a rating of "24" for its food in the 1995 Zagat Tri-State survey, jumped to 27 out of a possible 30.
The storefront restaurant in the Southdown shopping center was the front-runner in the Italian and Continental categories, as well as No. 1 among Suffolk restaurants.

The Man Who Made Jurors Feel Like Legal Eagles
Louis J. Ruggiero of Bogota, who died on July 22 at 75, put a human face on public service.
It was the face of a television comic from the early 1950's, or maybe the guy behind the deli counter who served every sandwich with a flourish and a cornball joke.
For the last two decades Mr.
Ruggiero was the petit jury clerk in the Bergen County Courthouse -- the official greeter, herdsman and advocate for the 200 or so citizens who showed up in his cavernous waiting room every Monday morning, having been summoned to serve as jurors -- and he is probably the one person every single juror will remember.
Jury service can be interesting and even (very rarely) exciting, but mostly it's tedious and bewildering, with long, unexplained delays, interminable whispered conferences at the bench, stern and patronizing injunctions from judges, ridiculously low pay ($5 a day, 2 cents a mile) and abrupt dismissals for no apparent reason.
Lou Ruggiero instinctively understood all this and, knowing that 9 out of 10 jurors would rather be elsewhere, set out to demystify and humanize the experience.


DIARY
Banking A Lid for Every Pot?
Not Yet It's about at this point that your elderly aunt leans across the dinner table and asks, "So how come you're not married yet?" So, Bank of Boston, how come?
The venerable Boston bank lost two suitors last week when Corestates Financial called off a $4.2 billion merger.
Then Banc One halted its bid, admitting that it really wasn't that interested in the Bank of Boston in the first place.
This kind of treatment is getting all too familiar to the Boston bank.
Earlier this year, Fleet Financial showed interest, but instead bought Shawmut National.
Then First Fidelity came to the door, but left with First Union.
So on Thursday, Ira Stepanian, the Bank of Boston's chairman and chief executive, left, a move than analysts interpreted as a "We're for sale announcement." Maybe it would help if there were a Sadie Hawkins Day for banks.


It's 1995, and They'd Rather Be in Little Rock
IT can almost seem cruel these days to remember how Arkansas gloried in Bill Clinton's rise to the Presidency: tens of thousands streaming into Little Rock on Election Day, inaugural guests triumphantly wearing small pewter replicas of the Arkansas razorback hog, and Little Rock's prestigious Rose Law Firm headily planning to open a Washington branch office.
Now, two and a half years and yet a political lifetime later, the Senate Whitewater hearings provide a daily, cautionary reminder of just how shattering the scrutiny and pressure of Washington turned out to be for so many members of the Arkansas elite who followed Mr.
Clinton into prestige and power.


Transgender Community Must Cope With Bigotry
To the Editor:
I found the July 16 article "The Shantytown of the He-She's" disturbing.
Members of the transgender community do not wish to be referred to as "he-she's," and those who identify as female do not refer to themselves as "he."


The War Was Ending. Times Square Exploded. Change Was Coming.
FOR millions of New Yorkers waiting anxiously in Times Square, World War II ended at 7:03 P.M.
Aug. 14, 1945.
At that moment, the 15,000 light bulbs on the Times Tower's zipper sign spelled out five words that touched off a tumultuous celebration: "Official -- Truman announces Japanese surrender."
After surviving years of scarcity and sacrifice, with London bombed, Paris humbled and Rome, Berlin and Tokyo occupied by foreign troops, New York had suddenly been elevated from the nation's major metropolis to the unrivaled world capital.

Dressed to Kill
Americans not only think of business as warfare, borrowing from Sun-tzu, Musashi and Attila the Hun, they also dress for it.
Take your average foot soldier barreling out of Grand Central at rush hour: from his head to his toes, his uniform has been modeled by war.
Consider the tie he wears.
Four hundred years ago, it was called a cravat, after the 17th-century Croatian mercenaries who wore them on the battlefields of France.
Chances are good our man's tie is a regimental stripe, whose colors originally connoted an officer's regiment, though now they could mean membership in anything from a country club to a bowling league.
A typical man's shoe is called a blucher, from the Prussian General Gebhard Leberecht von Blucher, who battled Napoleon.
Though defeated at Lubeck in 1806, Blucher survived to wear his namesakes to the battle of Waterloo.
Modern outerwear and warfare is an even closer fit.
Our commuter's trench coat has broad pockets, a removable lining and shoulder flaps, which made the coat highly practical for the British officers who wore them in Flanders during World War I. Those vestigial brass loops on the belt are actually grenade hooks.
And that wristwatch our commuter anxiously consults is another military improvement (circa 1914) over the vest pocket watch then in popular use.

Load or No-Load? The Gap Narrows
AS the line between load and no-load funds grows fuzzier, the debate about their relative merits grows louder.
Which fund type is more expensive?
Riskier?
Better performing?
Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking group in Chicago, tackled these questions in a recent report.
For their analysis, the Morningstar researchers selected two groups of diversified equity funds: load funds and no-load funds.


Diana McBaine, Courtney Cook
Diana Denny McBaine, the daughter of Alison Denny Harris and the adoptive daughter of Michael F. O. Harris of Seattle, was married yesterday to Courtney Stafford Cook, a son of Valda Jones Beeney of Bournemouth, England, and the late Robert M. Cook.
The Rev.
Allan C. Parker Jr. performed the ceremony at Trinity Parish Church in Seattle.
The bride is a clerk to Judge Thomas C. Platt of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, in Uniondale, L.I.
She graduated from Yale University and received a master's degree in European history and political theory from Oxford University and her law degree from Columbia University.
She is the daughter also of John Neylan McBaine of New York, a Manhattan lawyer.
The bride's stepmother, Ariel Bybee McBaine, is a mezzo-soprano with the Metropolitan Opera.


Rifle Group Takes A Bold New Stance Against the A.T.F.
The National Rifle Association, encouraged by the Republican ascendancy on Capitol Hill, has entered an aggressive new phase in its long and contentious relationship with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
At a hearing on the deadly confrontation between Federal agents and a sect near Waco, Tex., a lawyer for the rifle association sits in a seat reserved for Congressional staff members.
In pursuit of information embarrassing to the firearms agency, critics of the rifle group say, people associated with the organization have misrepresented themselves and were behind the disclosures about agents attending an annual event that has at times been marred by racist behavior.


In Small-Cap Land, Emotion Is a Bad Compass
EVEN the most astute portfolio managers make blunders.
In hindsight, though, they can see that they overlooked or neglected a critical element of the investment decision.
For small investors eager to learn from the masters, six mutual fund managers who have outdone most of their peers over the years agreed to share some of their more humbling experiences and the lessons learned.
While few were quick to laugh about their errors (one confessed to blocking out the details), they spoke with some candor about their oversights -- if not their losses -- in the hope of sparing others similar pains.


Susan Gluck, Gregory Pappajohn
Susan Mary Gluck, a daughter of Frederick W. Gluck of New York and Mary Ellen Gluck of New Rochelle, N.Y., was married yesterday to Gregory Ernest Pappajohn, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

The Rev.
Anthony Ugolnik, a Greek Orthodox minister, took part in the ceremony.
Ms.
Gluck, who is keeping her name, is the producer of CD-ROM computer software at Time-Warner Electronic Publishing in New York.
She was formerly a ballerina with the New York City Ballet.
The bride graduated cum laude from Harvard University and received an M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania.


Nudging Workers From Comfy Nests
ALTHOUGH he is a salesman, used to a peripatetic and independent life, John W. Coughlin always had an attachment to a desk.

She graduated from the State University at Binghamton, N.Y.
Her father owns the Summit Claim Service, an insurance-claim investigator in Farmingdale.


Together, 2 Magazines See Brighter Future
IT was a marriage of convenience between two little-known magazines, both aimed at international business managers.
Separately, each was losing money.
Together, they hoped to share staff in several departments and settle down to a long and happy -- and profitable -- life together.
Few Westchester residents were aware that one of the magazines, International Business, with a circulation of 62,000, had been published in Westchester for seven years and had been based for the last three in a shimmering glass box at 500 Mamaroneck Avenue in Harrison.
Fewer still knew that the other magazine, Foreign Trade, was in McLean, Va.


Young Performers in Recital
FOR the last six weeks, more than 100 youngsters have been steeped in the Hartford Conservatory's fifth annual summer program, singing in chorus, dancing, playing in a string ensemble or one of the three concert bands, improvising with a jazz group.
The results of these intensive coaching sessions and rehearsals will be on display this week in several free concerts.
Three short ones are on the Trinity Episcopal Church agenda at 5, 6 and 7 P.M.
Thursday, A longer program begins 7 P.M.
Friday in West Hartford's Masonic Hall, and the grand "Jazz and Roses" finale is set for next Sunday afternoon at 2 in Elizabeth Park.
Along with the student ensembles, the jazz outing also features Dick Oatts, as guest saxophonist, and members of the Conservatory artist faculty.

Avis Takes a Chance On Eastern Europe
Avis Germany has broken the rental-car barrier that replaced the Berlin wall, allowing renters of cars in Germany to drive into eastern Europe.
Auto Europe, a broker that uses Avis, among other companies, is also offering this option, as well as others for Eastern Europe.
Avis allows its cars to go into any Eastern European country except those with unstable political situations.
Auto Europe is renting cars in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Hungary, Italy and Switzerland that may be driven into Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Russia, Byelarus, Estonia, Lithuania and Ukraine.

Keep counting.
SYDNEY, INVINCIBLE.

Valerie Levitt, Mark Schmaier
Valerie Susan Levitt, a daughter of Edythe and V. David Levitt of Harrison, N.Y., was married last evening to Mark Joseph Schmaier, a son of Dr.
Maurice D. Schmaier of Emeryville, Calif., and the late Betty Steele Schmaier.
Rabbi Jon Haddon officiated at the Plaza in New York.
Mrs.
Schmaier, 30, graduated magna cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania and received an M.B.A. from Columbia University.
She was formerly a vice president of Chemical Bank in New York.
Her father is the president of Levitt-Fuirst Associates, an insurance agency in Yonkers, and a partner in Levitt &amp; Levy, a law firm in Mount Vernon, N.Y.


Now, Gifts to the House
The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, did everything he could to stop it.
So did Trent Lott, the Senate majority whip.
So did Mitch McConnell, who in a perverse twist of fate is Senate Ethics Committee chairman even though he has made a career of fighting clean politics.
But, in a rejection of this cynical leadership, the Senate, after some wavering, voted overwhelmingly last week to impose a strict ban on the free meals, vacations and other gifts that lobbyists now routinely bestow on lawmakers to gain a legislative advantage.
Several key Senators deserve credit for shaming their colleagues into relinquishing these corrupting perks.
Four Democrats -- Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, Carl Levin of Michigan, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey -- and one Republican, William Cohen of Maine, forced the issue onto the legislative calendar.
Without them reform would have been buried.
But the entire effort might have failed had Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, not intervened to negotiate the modest revisions that pulled in freshman Republican votes.


THE THING WITH FEATHERS
It is surprising that the White House press office said that even if it had a photo of President Clinton wearing ceremonial American Indian headgear, it wouldn't release it (Sunday, July 9).
Surprising because Clinton has Cherokee Indians among his ancestors.
It would appear to be an honor for him to be shown in traditional dress.

If You're Thinking of Living In: Edgewater; Factory Town Is Now Bedroom Community
SANDWICHED between the Palisades cliffs and the Hudson River, the tiny Borough of Edgewater, in Bergen County, N.J., is just three blocks wide and three-and-a-half miles long.
The one major artery, River Road, bisects the borough, accentuating the transition that has been in progress for 30 years, from factory town to an increasingly upscale bedroom community for executives working in Manhattan.
The western, Palisades side of the borough is tightly packed with small colonials and rowhouses that were once homes to some of the more than 10,000 people who worked in its heavy industries.
In contrast, the eastern, Hudson River side is filling up with luxury condominium apartments and town houses that are replacing the factories that used to depend on the waterway.


The Democrat Who Delivers the G.O.P. Message
Jeff Wiesenfeld's life is a tale of two parties, a parable of dual allegiances.
Born in the Bronx but loyal to Queens, his home since he was a teen-ager, Mr.
Wiesenfeld is a life-long registered Democrat.
But he works in the city as an attache of Gov.
George E. Pataki, the state's top Republican.


Broadway's Real Hits Are Its Antique Theaters
NOBODY GOES TO THE THEATER FOR the theater.
It's "Sunset Boulevard," not the Minskoff, that people are shelling out bucks to see.
The theater building is just the frame around the picture, the cover of the book.
But let's look at some frames anyhow.
Let's judge some covers.
For those frames, those covers, have a drama, a pictorial content, of their own.
They affect the total experience of playgoing -- and not always for the better.
And they can add or detract from the spectacle that is the theater district itself.


David Fighting Bookstore Goliath
Ever since Barnes &amp; Noble opened a megastore on Broadway at 82d Street in 1993, book lovers have wondered whether the Shakespeare &amp; Company bookstore, just one block south, could survive.
It has, but not without some setbacks, and not without some major changes in its marketing strategy.
Business has stabilized, company officials say, and the store is in the black.
Shakespeare has even taken a leaf from the Barnes &amp; Noble book by creating a mini-chain of its own.
In addition to its branch at 716 Broadway in Greenwich Village, the company plans to open a store this fall at 939 Lexington Avenue near 69th Street.


Transgender Community Must Cope With Bigotry
To the Editor:
I found the July 16 article "The Shantytown of the He-She's" disturbing.
Members of the transgender community do not wish to be referred to as "he-she's," and those who identify as female do not refer to themselves as "he."


BEHIND THE WHEEL/Rolls-Royce Silver Spur; Expensive Behemoth Is Surprisingly Nimble
I HAD done this before, I thought -- driven a car to the ooh-oohs of the crowd.
I had preened at the wheel in parades, and I had driven in races, although the ahhs then were more like gasps as I demonstrated true ineptitude in the turns.
But this was no race.
This was a v-e-r-y slow crawl through New York's Central Park, leading a $1.5 million line of fancy metal, and the appreciation from the multitude of skaters, joggers and muggers ranged from waves to stared befuddlement.
One woman whistled.


FRONTIERS OF MARKETING: The Imperial West
Life is always imitating advertising.
That's the point.
And Marlboro men are found on billboards all over the globe -- in Europe, Russia, China, Southeast Asia -- spreading a gospel that's in trouble at home but resonant elsewhere.
Of course, the imitators usually restrict themselves to smoking, since men on horseback are hard to find in downtown Hong Kong or Moscow.
They do, however, pop up in the oddest places.
The bit of semiotic serendipity above (rich enough to give a French philosopher a headache) came not from some remnant prairie in the Old West but from the Middle East.
The cowboy smoking a cigarette above was photographed, in a Marlboro moment, in Beirut.

Self-Portraits on Stage: Perspective Is Crucial
YOU NEED A CANNY -- NO, YOU NEED AN uncanny balance of self-love, self-loathing, self-respect and self-mockery to draw your own self-portrait, put it up on a stage and ask others to study it, savor it and pay for it.
You need technique too, for everybody does have a story to tell but only a small portion of those everybodies can tell it (talk it, sing it or dance it) in a way that interests most anybody for more than a few phrases at a time.
The three solo performances I saw this week (two in theaters, one adapted for television after a successful theater run) got me thinking about all of this.
One was pert and diminutive: parody in a New England doll's house.
One was all brazen, angry comedy and rueful intimacy: satire and self-exposure on the mean streets of New York City.
And the third was a quiet inquiry into the mysterious business of how we see ourselves and what limits we can or can't place on how others see us.  'The Springhill Singing Disaster'
Little girls who wanted to be pretty and sensitive and very special -- artistically gifted yet modest, spiritually virtuous yet adventurous -- may have wanted to be Greer Garson as Mrs.
Miniver in the 1940's and Deborah Kerr in "The King and I" or Audrey Hepburn in "The Nun's Story" in the 1950's.
But by the 1960's, they usually wanted to be Joan Baez, Judy Collins or Joni Mitchell, on stage alone with a guitar, face shielded by long, flowing hair, body covered by long, flowing garments, singing raptly to hushed, reverent millions.

For the Record/The Pork Barrel; Watch Out With That Budget Ax. My District NEEDS Than Dam.
For four decades, the Democrats who ruled Congress larded Federal spending bills with pork.
Locks, dams, people-movers, Federal research centers, passenger rail lines, electric buses, airport control towers, highway "demonstration projects" and Lord knows what else rained from Washington like inflation-adjusted pennies from heaven.
Everybody on Capitol Hill got wet.
But Republicans got damp, while Democrats got soaked.
And the Democrats who dispensed the goodies -- those who sat on Congress's appropriations and authorizing committees -- were so flooded that they needed dams, which, fortunately, they were in a position to finance.


Molly O'Rourke, Alexander Baldwin
Molly Katherine O'Rourke, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas O'Rourke of Summit, N.J., was married there yesterday to Alexander Denniston Baldwin, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Henry deForest Baldwin of New York.
The Rev.
Dr.
Charles T. Rush, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at Christ Church.
Ms.
O'Rourke, who is 26 and is keeping her name, is a Ph.D. candidate in American politics and applied statistical analysis at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.
She graduated magna cum laude from Brown University, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
She was formerly an aide to Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey.


In Search of the C.I.A.'s Bad Apples
Fred Hitz, the mild-mannered Ivy League lawyer who serves as the inspector general of the Central Intelligence Agency, says he has spent the past five years "looking at the dark side of the moon."
When things go wrong inside the agency, from espionage to expense-account fudging, Mr.
Hitz takes the case.
If an officer loses his grip or his moral bearings, Mr.
Hitz's job is to see to it that the employee is sacked or shunted aside -- to "shoot the wounded," as he put it.


Mexican Connection Grows As Cocaine Supplier to U.S.
The bodies of police informants still turn up around this sprawling border city, their mouths sometimes stuffed with one of the fingers they might have pointed at drug traffickers.
Mostly, though, the stronghold of the man thought to be Mexico's most powerful cocaine smuggler, Amado Carillo Fuentes, is almost peaceful compared with other drug capitals.
Gun battles are rare, car bombings unheard of.
The police chief cannot remember the last time armed thugs took over one of the discotheques for a party.


A Visitor From Germany Studies Faces in the Subway
To the Editor:
I am a visitor from Germany, and I have come here for the fourth time because I like the people in New York.
The subway is one of my favored places here, where I can watch people's faces, so different at different times -- tired faces in rush hour, funny faces on weekends.
Your July 16 article "Behind the Subway Trance" opened the faces and gave us a great view of the life and people of the city.

Inventors Hall of Fame Opens in Akron, Ohio
Inventure Place, Home of the National Inventors Hall of Fame, which opened in Akron, Ohio, this month, aspires to be more than a science museum and library.
It hopes to serve as an inventor's workshop and a national resource center for creativity.
It will also house the National Inventors Hall of Fame, which, since its formation in 1973, has inducted Americans whose inventions -- like the pacemaker and the camera, for instance -- have had more than a passing influence on the nation's quality of life.
The money for the project, $38 million, came from city and state agencies as well as from private corporations.
The centerpiece of the new 77,000-square-foot facility, designed by the New York architect James Stewart Polshek, is a stainless-steel sail-shaped building housing five tiers of exhibits related to the best-known inventors in the United States and their inventions.
Highlights include an exhibit that allows visitors to use computer programs to make animations and a "mechanically controlled laser light show," in which they use mirrors to create and project laser patterns on a screen.


Twig Gallemore, Melissa D. Kingman
Melissa D. Kingman, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Dong Kingman Jr. of New York, was married yesterday to Thomas Wilson Ira Gallemore, a son of Dr.
Gail Hurd Gallemore of Johnson City, Tenn., and Dr.
Johnnie L. Gallemore Jr. of Norfolk, Va.
The Rev.
Blaine Ellsworth, a Presbyterian minister, officiated at Auberge du Soleil in Rutherford, Calif.
The bride, 25, and bridegroom, 26, graduated from Carnegie Mellon University.


Curtain Going Up on a Rescued Summer Theater
ADARK THEATER IN A SMALL town is like a corpse in the living room.
It's dead and it's there.
For many of its 40 years, the Sharon Playhouse in the northwest corner of Connecticut limped along, cherished but in debt, a primer for How Not to Run a Summer Theater.
Five years ago, gasping for air, the big barn finally went belly up.
"It was your typical summer theater experience," says the actress Jane Curtin, who lives in Sharon.
"You know, holes in the roof. They would do 'Godspell.' When it closed, you'd drive by and it was very sad."


A Curio From Broadway's Golden 1960's
EVEN in the time of Broadway musical constancy, "High Spirits" (1964-65) was something of a curio.
Neither hit nor miss, the show was propelled by idiosyncratic stars, Beatrice Lillie and Tammy Grimes, and the glitter of Noel Coward, who gave the musical its source ("Blithe Spirit") and its nominal direction.
Off the record, it was Gower Champion, the director and choreographer of that season's prize-winner, "Hello, Dolly!" who spruced up the musical's staging while Coward was not allowed the credit that was rightfully his.
That was because the musical's book, attributed to Hugh Martin and Timothy Gray, was merely a condensed rendering of the popular comedy that the English master of wit and dispatch was said to have dashed off in six days in 1941.


Fresh Fruit, With Coupons
On Thursday, 14 wriggly 2- and 3-year-olds from a day care center peeped over the top of a table and waited for free fruit salad at the fenced-in paved lot on Lexington Avenue and 97th Street.
It was opening day for the East Harlem Community Farmer's Market, and the nutrition educators were out in force, as they plan be every Thursday.
"The next time your mommy gives you a cookie," Katherine Chen, a volunteer, told the toddlers, "say, no, no, no, I want fruit and vegetables."


Making History Sound as Good as It Looks
THE THIRD COURTYARD MAY be the most beautiful of all.
We have just walked over the castle moat, gazed down at two bears ambling below and passed through the wooden-floored tunnel, taking the same path the Eggenbergs' golden coach did in 1683.
As we mill around, the windows open high above, burnished trombones catch the sun, and a brass ensemble plays Gabrieli fanfares.
We are enmeshed in an event called "Wandering Through Time," part of a chamber-music festival here.
Instead of the usual sit-down-and-sit-still concert, the program offers a walking tour through the rooms of the castle.
And happily for this castlephobe, the usual leg-cramping trek is animated by musicians, some in historic costumes, serenading the pilgrims with music more or less related to the historical periods of particular rooms.


New Lottery Prize: Permit to Paint
During years of police crackdowns that drove sidewalk artists from Greenwich Village, Times Square and Soho, many of them found refuge in Central Park.
There they set up easels to make quick portraits for pay.
But they lost that sanctuary a couple of weeks ago as the park became their latest battleground.
The police ordered the artists out and hauled one away in handcuffs on a charge of vending without a license.


BUSINESS NTOES
Louis Vuitton's Itinerary Sends Laura Ashley Packing Laura Ashley closed its New York flagship store, at 21 East 57th Street, on Wednesday after its landlord failed to renew the lease.
The landlord, Starre Realty, hopes to use the site, between Fifth and Madison Avenues, for an office tower of 15 to 25 stories, with retail space on the ground floor.
It has also bought up the two buildings next door, 17 and 19 East 57th Street, to use as part of the high-rise parcel.
Starre is a new partnership formed by Robert Siegel, president of Metropole Realty Advisors (which had owned 21 East 57th Street), and Michael Burke, the president of Louis Vuitton, N.A.
Plans call for Louis Vuitton, the luggage maker, to close its only Manhattan store, on 57th between Madison and Park Avenues, and move into 4,600 square feet in the new building.


The Path to Screenwriter of 'Prizzi's Honor'
ALTHOUGH "Prizzi's Honor" was her first screenplay, Janet Roach, who won an Academy Award nomination for it, was by no means a stranger to the camera.
"I decided when I was in third grade," Ms.
Roach recounted in her home on Shelter Island, "that I was going to make documentaries for CBS News." Eventually she did.


The Battling Borogh Presidents
Under zoning changes proposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, sex-related businesses would be prohibited from operating withing 500 feet of residences, schools and houses of worship, and within 500 feet of each other.
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, and Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, spoke about the issue last week.
CLAIRE SHULMAN
"The zoning as proposed works for us. Of course, we'd like the 500 feet to be 1,000. But in essence, the bottom line is that what has been proposed will protect us more than we are currently being protected and we suport it and I believe it will withstand constitutional challenges.


A Fight for Life Is Waged in an Angry Courtroom
Darkness still gripped the City of Brotherly Love in the early morning hours of Dec. 9, 1981, when Daniel Faulkner, a white police officer, was shot to death after making a routine traffic stop.
A few months later, Mumia Abu-Jamal, a well-known black radio journalist who was also active in political causes here, was convicted of the officer's murder and condemned to die, a sentence that is scheduled to be carried out on Aug. 17.


Tour Fugitive
To the Editor:
My husband and I and friends have just returned from a 17-day tour of Turkey, organized by Tursem.
Our experiences were above our expectations -- every day filled with exciting tours and adventures.
We had time for ourselves to explore and go to places of our special interest.
The 30 people in our group were most compatible.
We would highly recommend the tour we took.  MILDRED LEWIS  Great Neck, L.I.


A Storyteller With a Sensitive Wit
ONE OF THE MORE Interesting -- and certainly one of the most amusing -- music videos in recent memory is Jill Sobule's "I Kissed a Girl." In it, two women who are bored with their boyfriends escape their doldrums by having a fling not with each other's mates but with each other.
With a fanciful Pee-wee's-Playhouse look and the beyond-hip casting coup of the supermodel Fabio playing Ms.
Sobule's unsuspecting hunk, this clever video to a clever song manages to tackle a controversial topic with disarming wit and style.
And the video makes one curious to find out what else this seemingly offbeat singer and songwriter might have up her sleeve.
The answer, as shown by "Jill Sobule" (Lava/Atlantic), her wonderfully entertaining new album, is plenty.
A relatively unknown performer who released an album on MCA Records in 1990 and had a second one rejected by that label in 1992, Ms.
Sobule successfully presents herself here as a thoughtful, sensitive and often riotously funny songwriter.
She has a penchant for richly detailed vignettes about colorful characters weaving their way through all types of physical, emotional and moral landscapes.


Seles Conquers a Pair of Foes: Nervousness and Navratilova
Her fall from the pinnacle of tennis in April 1993 was as perverse as it was unprecedented: She was stabbed in the back by a fanatical supporter of the very woman she had supplanted as the world's No. 1 player.
So it seemed only fitting today that Monica Seles's comeback -- after a two-year physical and emotional blackout -- to the sport she dominated as a teen-ager would be unprecedented, and a bit perverse as well.


July 23-29: Hope for the Obese?; A Hormone Is Found That Helps Reduce Fat
It seemed almost too good to be true -- a hormone thatmakes animals, and maybe people, eat less and exercise more.
But researchers say that is exactly what they have found.
The hormone, called leptin, is secreted by fat cells and appears to tell the brain how much fat is present in the body.
Too much leptin and an animal loses weight by eating less, increasing its metabolic rate, and moving about more.
Too little and it gains weight.


Corrections
A brief article last Sunday about tax fraud charges against two former baseball stars misstated their playing records in some copies.
Duke Snider hit 407 home runs in 18 seasons in the major leagues and Willie McCovey hit 521 in 22 seasons in the major leagues.


Laura C. Hoover, Scott D. Shapley
Laura Cochran Hoover, the daughter of Mrs.

Fredrick Shapley of Del Rey Oaks, Calif.
The Rev.
Paul Danielson, assisted by the bride's uncle the Rev.
Everett M. Caes, performed the Protestant ceremony at the Swedenborgian Church in San Francisco.
Mrs.
Shapley, 25, is the commercial counselor in Yekaterinburg, Russia, for the International Executive Service Corps, a business consulting organization.
She and her husband graduated from the University of California at San Diego, she summa cum laude.
Her father is the president of the Hoover Capital Corporation, a venture capital concern in San Francisco.
Her mother, Margaret P. Anderson, is an art consultant in Fairfield.


Grand National Bridge Team Final Begins
Teams representing Las Vegas and Chicago faced each other here this afternoon in the final of the Grand National Team Championship at the American Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals.
After 16 deals of a scheduled 64, Chicago led by 16 imps.
On Friday night, the Las Vegas foursome of Peter Nagy, Marc Jacobus, Billy Cohen and Harold Lilie won their semifinal match against New York by 49 imps after gaining 71 in the first quarter.


On Fire Island, Naked Came the Burglar
First he was wearing a flowered skirt and not much else.
By the time the sun was high, the burglary suspect had shed even the skirt.
Finally, modesty demanded a towel, artfully draped.
Weather and locale require adjustments in all professions, which may explain why the suspect's victims on Fire Island, L.I., found him in various stages of undress last Thursday.
Still, this was one burglary suspect whose tastes were anything but casual, his approach to dress notwithstanding.
When the police finally found him, it was with a $90 bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne, and $90 worth of Beluga caviar.


Photographers Putting Their Eggs in Technology's Basket
AN exhibition called "Content and Discontent in Today's Photography" -- a joint effort by Independent Curators Inc. in Manhattan and Friends of Photography/Ansel Adams Center in San Francisco -- is at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich.
The title seems like a warning and maybe should be taken as such for, depending on the viewer, the show reflects an impasse or its solution.
In his brochure essay, the curator, Andy Grundberg, proposes that abstraction, once regarded as an "escape from representation" now strikes many artists as "another kind of representation -- albeit one culturally coded to suggest universality, spirituality, freedom and artistic authenticity."


Spies &amp; Thrillers
In Robert Byrne's aptly titled novel THRILL (Carroll &amp; Graf, $19.95), a young California woman is thrown out of an amusement park's old roller coaster and killed.
The roller coaster is named (what else?) Thrill, and now it has to be rebuilt to be made safer -- over the ob jections of the original designer, a man who contemplates his works much as Rembrandt might have contemplated a finished canvas.
And why not?
He is the Rembrandt of roller-coaster designers.
Jack McKenzie, an engineer, is hired to oversee the project, but it soon becomes clear that an assassin is out to sabotage it.
McKenzie, though, can see no flaw in the redesign and even plans to go on the inaugural ride of the new Thrill, although he hates roller coasters.
He will not be alone, of course.
The mayors of nearby cities and other notables will also go along.


Melissa Langlois and Michael Halow
Melissa Mayson Langlois, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
David P. Langlois of Madison, N.J., was married yesterday to Michael Joseph Halow, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Halow of Potomac, Md.
The Rev.
Stephen Rozzelle performed the ceremony at St.
Mark's Episcopal Church in Basking Ridge, N.J.
The bride, 24, graduated from Princeton University and is a candidate for a Ph.D. in political sociology at the University of Chicago.
Her father is a partner in Piper &amp; Marbury, a law firm in New York.
Her mother, Catherine M. Langlois, is a judge of the New Jersey Superior Court in Morristown.


Catherine Van Cook, John Parsons
Catherine Victoria Van Cook, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
William M. Van Cook of Shrub Oak, N.Y., was married Friday to John Gary Parsons, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Charles T. Parsons of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.
The Rev.
Donald Hendricks, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at St.
Christopher's Church in Buchanan, N.Y.


Shared Quarters Leads To Shared Faith Study
THE landlord-tenant relationship is rarely one in which friendship flourishes, but the experience of a church and a synagogue here offer an encouraging exception to the rule.
When the Greenburgh Hebrew Center sought space for its worship service and nursery school a few years ago because its own synagogue was being renovated, the Zion Episcopal Church here offered the Jewish congregation the use of its parish hall.


Red Harvest
Since the 16th century, when the Spanish brought them back to Europe from Mexico, tomatoes have been a palimpsest upon which societies scribbled their fears and fantasies.
First considered poisonous, then an aphrodisiac, tomatoes were finally deemed pitiful, an assessment from which, even today, only the rare specimen escapes.
A full two centuries after Italy had embraced them, England and America were still suspicious, according the tomato (and probably the Italians) the kind of disapprobation usually reserved for the common.
As late as 1860, Godey's Lady's Book admonished proper American housewives that their tomatoes should be cooked for three hours.
A necessity that would sanitize and presumably redeem this lowly comestible.


MOVIES THIS WEEK
SOME treasured old friends return to the television roster this week.
A STREETCARE NAMED DESIRE (1951), with its haunting impact and two great performances, has a suprise if you look sharp.
It's still a photographed play, via Tennessee Williams.
But close up, again under Elia Kazan's direction, it vibrates even more than on stage, with Vivien Leigh as the doomed Southern belle and Marlon Brando (in photograph with Kim Hunter) as her brutal brother-in-law, in a superb cast.
The cumulative wallop is so strong that a softened ending gets by.
And was there ever such a lingering title? -- Saturday at 5 P.M. and 11 P.M. on American Movie Classics.
Few romantic fantasies rate the word enchanting.
Joseph L. Mankiewicz's GHOST AND MRS.
MUIR (1947) is one.
It's the story of a lonely widow (Gene Tierney) and the hovering spirit of a caustic skipper (Rex Harrison).
Their cozy interchange is wry, wistful and sweet-edged.
There are three show-stealers: that cliffside Cornwall house, Edna Best's quiet servant and Bernard Herrmann's music, evocative as sea mist -- Monday at 9 P.M. and Monday/Early Tuesday at 3:45 A.M. on Disney.


Christina Stafford and Jason Chapin
Christina Elizabeth Stafford, a daughter of John and Dr.
Inge Stafford of Essex Fells, N.J., was married last evening to Jason Campbell Chapin, a son of Sandra Chapin of Huntington, L.I., and the late Harry F. Chapin, the singer and songwriter.
The Rev.
John Worthington performed the ceremony at the First Presbyterian Church at Caldwell, N.J.
Mrs.
Chapin, 28, is a graduate of Colgate University, as is her husband.
She received a master's degree in teaching from Columbia University.
Until recently she taught English and was the assistant director of the Upper School of the Brooklyn Friends School.
In September, she is to attend the master's degree program at the Shirley M. Ehrenkranz School of Social Work, at New York University.


Zoning Goal: Remake Long Island City
Since the 1920's, city planners have dreamed of transforming Long Island City into a major urban center just five minutes by subway from midtown Manhattan on the Queens bank of the East River.
In September, the City Planning Commission will vote on proposed zoning changes that would make the dream possible.
The changes would restrict heavy manufacturing, like paint factories, steel plants or businesses that require a lot of open storage or use noxious materials, in favor of light manufacturing, like contracting companies, apparel factories and printing plants.
They would also restrict construction of new parking facilities and encourage some housing development in Hunters Point, which is classified as a special mixed-use district with a blend of industrial and residential life.


A Message to the Bats of Brielle: Don't Look for Lodging Here
As dusk falls, the bats of Monmouth County leave their nests in attics and steeples and old factory chimneys and wheel into the sky in search of breakfast.
They hover around electric lights and in marshes, swooping down on tasty, thick-bodied moths, fireflies and the odd swarm of mosquitoes.
And when the night is through, if they know what's good for them, they will steer clear of the borough of Brielle, where a long-simmering housing debate has now been decided against the bats.


'Forget Paris' Indeed, as Theater Goes Indian
The Gramercy Theater is still called the Gramercy Theater.
But the old-fashioned single-screen cinema on 23d, west of Lexington, which lay dormant for a year and a half in an industry gripped by multiplex mania, has a new identity that is making one immigrant community literally applaud.


July 23-29: Terror in Paris; A Bomb Kills Seven In French Subway Yet Leaves Few Clues
The bomb blast in a Paris subway station that left seven dead and some 80 injured last week was a new reminder of the vulnerability of mass transportation systems to terrorism.
The Irish Republican Army used to target London's railroad stations.
Tokyo's commuters have been terrorized by poisonous gas.
The bomb went off on a crowded underground train at the height of the evening rush-hour.
The difficulty of preventing such attacks explains the French Government's scramble to discover who was behind the explosion.
It has tried to reassure the public by tightening security at train and metro stations, airports and even on the streets of Paris.
But police are still unsure who the culprits are.


Sweltering Minds Devise Creative Ways to Beat Heat
With the New York region slogging through its 12th day in tropical inferno mode, minus the side benefits of coconut palms, efforts to beat the heat yesterday inspired varied prescriptions:
Running a few miles, then jumping into the sauna.


SURVEYS: Sex and Weight
There is no escaping sex surveys.
The latest comes from Weight Watchers Magazine.
This survey of 6,000 magazine readers found that 38 percent had sex once or twice a week and 18 percent three to six times a week.
A 1994 study of the general population showed that less than 8 percent of the women surveyed had sex four or more times a week.
Also 70 percent usually have orgasms.
Of course, a closer look shows that 75 percent of married women in the general survey usually have orgasms, calling into dispute the sexiness of fat.
But the editor of Weight Watchers Magazine, Nancy Gagliardi, says her readers have good sex because "their appetite for life is big and lustful."


ON THE BORDER OF LIFE
I was pleased to note that, in the 1990's, the response of medical staff toward bereaved parents is so much more enlightened than it was in the 1960's.
The only advice anyone seemed capable of offering us was to forget what had happened as quickly as possible.
How we would love to have in our possession a box such as that presented to the DeCostas, containing tangible evidence of our son's short life.

Next Up for Angels, Yet Another .300 Hitter
The Cleveland Indians, Sparky Anderson said, "we saw coming; this one jumped up on us."
"This one" is the California Angels, the most surprising team in the American League.
From a three-year run of finishing with records 18 games under .500 or worse (21 last year), the Angels entered last night's game in Milwaukee 19 games over .500 and menacing their opponents with an offense at least as awesome as that of the Indians.


F.Y.I.
The Ear of the Beholder Q.  Where did Aqueduct race track get its name?
Belmont is named for August Belmont, who founded that track, and Saratoga is named after Saratoga Springs, the upstate town where the track is located.
But isn't Aqueduct a strange name?
A.
Actually, Aqueduct got its name the same way Saratoga did.
When it opened, on Sept. 27, 1894, it was in an area known as Aqueduct.
And that was named because there was an aqueduct there.

Appeals End At High Court On Rent Control
The United States Supreme Court has refused to hear an appeal to safeguard the rent of nine tenants who live at Federally owned apartment building on East 57th Street.
Tenant advocates say the decision is significant because it is the first time that a Federal agency has been allowed to suspend state-established rent control.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
A Backyard Beach Game
SUMMERTIME means "Beach Blanket Bingo" at the Corrazoni house in Greenport.
Every weekend friends flock there to swim and play beach volleyball.
"I love playing volleyball in the sand," P. J. Corrazoni said.
"We're getting older, and the sand is more forgiving on the ankles and knees."
It doesn't matter that Mr.
Corrazoni and his wife, Ruthanne, don't live near any water or sand.
They had a swimming pool installed.
And a beach.
Forty-two yards of sand was transported to their backyard, where it was molded into a regulation beach volleyball court.

Thank you on behalf of those of us who care for premature infants and their families.
I would like to add that although our attempts to replace placental function have a long way to go, there is hope.

July 23-29; 115 Years Late, He Won His Bars
When Johnson Chesnut Whittaker, a former slave, became one of the first black cadets to enter West Point in 1876, his brass ring was the brass bars of a second lieutenant's commission.
Last week, his family finally got them -- nearly 115 years after the Army falsely accused him of staging a racist attack on himself and expelled him.
In a White House ceremony, President Clinton told Whittaker's descendants that he was "a pathfinder -- a man who, through courage, example and perseverance, paved the way for future generations of African-American military leaders."

SHH!
IF YOU SPEND SUMMER NIGHTS listening to car alarms and contemplating violence, you should know that there's a better way to stop the wailing.
You can become a law-abiding vigilante.
You can join the dedicated private volunteers -- think of them as a thousand points of order -- not afraid to stand up for silence.
New York's public officials love to worry about hypothetical dangers from minuscule traces of chemical pollutants, but they're strangely indifferent to noise pollution and its demonstrated effects: loss of sleep, surges in blood pressure, poor academic performance, not to mention the injuries that can be sustained while kicking out a set of headlights.
New Yorkers are forbidden to smoke in private offices and restaurants, even if it bothers no one else, but they're free to pollute a public street with a false alarm that wakes hundreds.
It's been calculated, using economists' standard assumptions about the value of people's time, that in a densely populated New York neighborhood the social costs imposed by a car alarm are greater than the value of the car itself.
So even if the alarms deterred thieves -- which they don't -- they still deserve to be outlawed here.


Bugs? Often Enough, the Hose Is the Answer
THE recent hot weather plus a prolonged drought have left an ugly mark on the green world.
Lawns are browned off, trees are dropping leaves prematurely and mildew is rampant.
Certain specimen plants are dwarfs of their usual selves.
In many cases, flowering is either off schedule or not what it should be.
Many annuals are setting seed prematurely.
Hopefully the return of cooler weather and adequate rainfall will set things right again.
Meanwhile, hoses and watering cans have been put into yeoman service.


Retirement's Worried Face
LIKE so many of his generation, Ronald McPherson switched careers in his 40's, going from social work to computers.
But the job switching and then illness shrank his once-generous pensions.
And now at age 56, Mr.
McPherson finds himself scrambling in part-time work to save enough for retirement.
"I never thought this would happen to me," he said.
Or take Fern Marx, who is 59.
She quit college to marry and raise children, but at 40 found herself divorced.
Like so many women her age in the same fix, Ms.
Marx managed to build a late-in-life career, earning $60,000 as a researcher in Wellesley, Mass.
In retirement, that will shrink to $20,000.
"I have no choice but to work into my 70's," she said.

Advice for a Rock Band: Stay Away From the Clubs
To the Editor:
As a rock musician who has been a partner in a record company, I found the July 23 article "The Life and Times of a Young Rock Band" yet another example of how these bands defeat their own goals and objectives at the square one level.
A simple study of rock music's commercial and social traditions reveals the golden rule missing from the "curriculum" accompanying the article: Know thy audience.

Has Anyone Examined Artificial Reefs?
In "On Fire I., Beach Erosion Takes Heavy Toll"  [ June 25 ] , Marsha Hunter, Commissioner of the Kismet Beach Erosion Control District, is noted as remarking that a dune area which a (sand) bar protected was untouched.
It is the sandbars that protect Long Island's beaches and, especially, its dunes formed just after the Ice Age and which, once eroded, do not restore themselves, as does the lower beach with tidal sand.
Long Island's beach and dunes, the only seashore area possessed by New York State, is important to the Federal Government, as well, since it is part of the national coastline.
If the beaches and dunes are destroyed completely, as is happening on Fire Island, Long Island will no longer be able to contribute millions of dollars in taxes from recreation revenues to state and Federal Governments, as it has been doing, ever increasingly, since the 19th century.


Thrill Ride Malfunctions And Hurts 12
More than a dozen people were injured last night, including one woman whose leg was severed, when a popular centrifugal-force ride at Coney Island broke down as it was spinning, tossing at least two riders into the air and sending those inside smashing into the walls.
The ride, called the Hell Hole, employs a large wooden barrel that rotates rapidly.
When the force has pinned riders to the inside of the wall, the floor beneath them drops out.


IN SHORT: NONFICTION
THE HERO'S APPRENTICE  Essays.
By Laurence Gonzales.
University of Arkansas, cloth, $24; paper, $14.
Laurence Gonzales says that by seeking out and mastering extreme situations, we transcend the instinct of fear that cloaks our true nature.
In this collection of previously published essays, Mr.
Gonzales, a magazine journalist and the author of the novel "One Zero Charlie," describes losing control of his airplane while practicing inverted flat spins, yet he writes that once he had learned to handle a flat spin, he came, somehow, to like the danger.
The author's curiosity about danger manifests itself in every piece in "The Hero's Apprentice." He straps on a helmet and a heat-reflecting jacket and steps through a wall of fire into an escalating inferno; a woman with a sprained ankle teaches him to walk a tightrope without a net; he clings, 900 feet up, to the steel skeleton of an unfinished building, as a helicopter nearly blows him over the edge; he witnesses Navy pilots attempting their first night landings on an aircraft carrier.
"The Hero's Apprentice" contains many moments of great danger, and Mr.
Gonzales searches for a lesson in each of them, making his book a surprising mix of adventure and intellect.

An article in the Connecticut Weekly last Sunday about the reaction of Greenwich residents to national news media attention misstated the town's median household income.
According to the 1990 census, it was $65,072, not $500,000, which is the median price of owner-occupied houses.


Hiroshima Films: Always a Political Fallout
CREATIVE ARTISTS OF EVERY variety have made incisive, satiric or powerful statements about nuclear threat.
They have offered cautionary works that depict the horror of the bomb or its meaning in our society.
What these artistic statements share, however, with rare exceptions, is an avoidance of the specific subject of Hiroshima.
Since September 1945, when "First Yank in Tokyo" brought the mushroom cloud to the screen, hundreds if not thousands of "nuclear" movies have appeared.
Americans have been exposed to several foreign films on the subject, most notably Akira Kurosawa's "Rhapsody in August," Shohei Imamura's "Black Rain" and, of course, Alain Resnais's classic 1959 drama "Hiroshima, Mon Amour." These films are original or highly imaginative and contain striking images.

Crime's Down, but Why? Two Views on a Pleasant Surprise
Evidence of that most unlikely of national trends, the plummeting crime rate, arrived in New Jersey last week.
The state's Uniform Crime Report for 1994, released on Thursday, contained numbers that should have every police chief from Wyckoff to Wildwood smiling.
Crime fell less in New Jersey than in the Northeast as a whole in 1994, according to the report, which is issued anually by the State Police.
But there were solid, across-the-board decreases in every major category of crime, in every type of community -- urban, suburban and rural.


Shield Against Welfare Cheats
WESTCHESTER took another step forward this month in its get-tough policy toward welfare clients.
As part of the county's ongoing effort to shake out welfare cheats, the Department of Social Services initiated a state-of-the-art electronic fingerprinting program at its district office here.
The antifraud system is being tested here on single adults and childless couples seeking home relief and is also beginning in Yonkers.
It will be expanded to other district offices in coming weeks.
The office here was chosen for the program because it receives about 15 percent of the county's applications for Home Relief, the state welfare program for single adults, Mary E. Glass, Social Services Commissioner, said.


MOVIES THIS WEEK
SOME treasured old friends return to the television roster this week.
A STREETCARE NAMED DESIRE (1951), with its haunting impact and two great performances, has a suprise if you look sharp.
It's still a photographed play, via Tennessee Williams.
But close up, again under Elia Kazan's direction, it vibrates even more than on stage, with Vivien Leigh as the doomed Southern belle and Marlon Brando (in photograph with Kim Hunter) as her brutal brother-in-law, in a superb cast.
The cumulative wallop is so strong that a softened ending gets by.
And was there ever such a lingering title? -- Saturday at 5 P.M. and 11 P.M. on American Movie Classics.
Few romantic fantasies rate the word enchanting.
Joseph L. Mankiewicz's GHOST AND MRS.
MUIR (1947) is one.
It's the story of a lonely widow (Gene Tierney) and the hovering spirit of a caustic skipper (Rex Harrison).
Their cozy interchange is wry, wistful and sweet-edged.
There are three show-stealers: that cliffside Cornwall house, Edna Best's quiet servant and Bernard Herrmann's music, evocative as sea mist -- Monday at 9 P.M. and Monday/Early Tuesday at 3:45 A.M. on Disney.


Communism in Laos: Poverty and a Thriving Elite
As Laos, a vital but virtually forgotten battleground of the Vietnam War, prepares to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its Communist "people's democracy," it remains a place of harsh inequalities.
It is a country of 4.5 million people where a small class of entrepreneurs and members of the Communist establishment has attained a level of prosperity reminiscent of the privileged life of those who benefited from French colonialism and the years of American dominance that ended with the Communist victory.


The War Was Ending. Times Square Exploded. Change Was Coming.
FOR millions of New Yorkers waiting anxiously in Times Square, World War II ended at 7:03 P.M.
Aug. 14, 1945.
At that moment, the 15,000 light bulbs on the Times Tower's zipper sign spelled out five words that touched off a tumultuous celebration: "Official -- Truman announces Japanese surrender."
After surviving years of scarcity and sacrifice, with London bombed, Paris humbled and Rome, Berlin and Tokyo occupied by foreign troops, New York had suddenly been elevated from the nation's major metropolis to the unrivaled world capital.

On the Civic Side of the Profit Motive
THE metal No Turns sign dangling from an overhead chain at 14th Street and Park Avenue South often flips in the wind and becomes invisible to drivers, who make the turn and get picked off by cops waiting in ambush.
Watching the sign sway, Rob Walsh said, "Sometimes I get so mad they don't fix that sign, I think I should hang out here and offer my services to drivers who get tickets."
Then came the Rob Walsh smile, that big, engaging, boyish, political smile that crinkles his tanned, handsome, puggy face.
It includes us in the absurdity of the "Mayor of Union Square" abandoning the high rollers of the current hot neighborhood to champion little people cruising in from the boroughs to buy bargains at Bradlees.

Remnant From a Golden Age on Broadway
EVEN in the time of Broadway musical constancy, "High Spirits" (1964-65) was something of a curio.
Neither hit nor miss, the show was propelled by idiosyncratic stars, Beatrice Lillie and Tammy Grimes, and the glitter of Noel Coward who gave the musical its source ("Blithe Spirit") and its nominal direction.
Off the record, it was Gower Champion, the director and choreographer of that season's prize-winner, "Hello, Dolly!" who spruced up the musical's staging while Coward was not allowed the credit that was rightfully his.


Philharmonic Paying Its 15th Visit to County
MUSIC under the stars -- or sun, as the case may be -- continues to be a summer attraction.
On Friday, for instance, the New York Philharmonic makes its 15th yearly pilgrimage to Westchester Community College in Valhalla.
Bobby McFerrin, the singer whose recently discovered conducting skills have brought him to the podiums of major orchestras nationwide, is the guest maestro, leading works by Faure, Bizet, Strauss, Dukas and Gershwin.


MEASURES: How to Clean The Kilogram?
The meter, based on the speed of light, is unchanging, as is the second, which is based on the oscillation of a cesium atom.
But when it comes to the kilogram, plus ca change plus ce n'est pas la meme chose.
The international standard for the kilogram is a platinum-iridium cylinder, left, kept in Paris.
Every few years (1910, 1946, 1989), the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures assembles the national standards -- similar cylinders kept in different countries -- to calibrate them against the international standard.
There is inevitable variation, in the accumulation of minute amounts of water vapor, carbon, mercury and other contaminants because the various cylinders are cleaned by hand -- by different hands, to be precise.


On Radio Show, Clinton Warns of Dangers of Cuts in Medicare
Surrounded by an invited audience of senior citizens, including his mother-in-law, President Clinton warned today that Republican plans to slow the growth of Medicare spending could push half a million elderly people into poverty by the turn of the century to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.
"We do need to protect Medicare from going bankrupt, but we don't have to bankrupt older Americans to do it," Mr.
Clinton said in his weekly radio address from the Oval Office.
"Medicare is too important to all families to become a piggy bank for just a few."


Flavor and Texture in Vietnamese Salads
SALADS are very much part of the cooking of Vietnam, much more so than in other countries of Southeast Asia.
Even their spring rolls are salad-like, made with large leaves of lettuce rolled around a filling and served cold instead of deep-fried in dough.
At Le Colonial, a Vietnamese restaurant at 149 East 57th Street in Manhattan, the salads are among the most popular dishes on the menu, even in winter, because they are so refreshing.
They are light but highly spiced, combining interesting contrasts of texture and flavor.
The chef, Viet Tran, who is from Saigon -- he worked at Indochine before going to Le Colonial -- uses traditional ingredients like fresh mint, coriander, cucumber, bean sprouts and iceberg lettuce, which adds crunch.
The salads can be prepared ahead of time and put together at the last minute, which makes them great for summer entertaining.


Nostalgia on Display, and for Sale
In this jewel of a village, dedicated to the beauty and memory of an American romance -- baseball and its Hall of Fame -- the harsh realities of modern times and the eternal frailties of man and ballplayer were evident here this induction weekend in a way they rarely were before.
Along Main Street, amid the maple and linden trees and the red geraniums hanging from flower pots on lampposts, were photographs and memorabilia in shop after shop.
Here was Babe Ruth in full, portly swing; there was gentle Christy Mathewson in that funny old Giants warm-up sweater, and here were bats, balls, hats and uniforms worn and used by Reggie and Sandy, Aaron and Seaver, Mantle and Mays, as well as three of this year's inductees, Mike Schmidt and Richie Ashburn of the Phillies and Leon Day, a Negro leagues pitcher.


MUSIC: Even Rabbis Sing the Blues
"We're just four guys getting together, praising God and playing some tunes." It's a comment that's very familiar in this country from the vast world of Christian music -- from rock to reggae.
But this time it comes from Benzion Elya Lehrer, the red-bearded and tallit-wearing lead singer of the Returning Light Band, Jerusalem's hottest Hasidic rock band.
His guitarist, Yael Taieb, is at right.
Every Saturday night -- after Sabbath -- they jam before an audience of foot-stomping yeshiva students and tourists at a 400-year-old former synagogue on Mount Zion.
In deference to ultra-Orthodox tradition, tall wooden screens separate male and female fans.


Safety vs. History on Columbia Walkways
Is great architecture in the details?
Preservationists who are angry at Columbia University for rebuilding some brick walkways think so.
Charles McKim of McKim, Mead &amp; White planned Columbia University in the 1890's, he designed walkways of hand-made brick to connect classrooms, laboratories and offices.
But Columbia is currently repaving the now uneven walkways, using bricks that are shorter, narrower, rougher and a brighter red.


Expanding System Metes Out Mashantucket Justice
A MEDICINE wheel decorated with buckskin, trade beads, hackle feathers and the face of a fox hangs on the wall of the Mashantucket Pequot tribal courtroom.
The medicine wheel and a judge's gavel, also embellished with beads and feathers, symbolize the traditions and customs that make the newly created tribal court different from non-Indian courts of law.
The opening of Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino and the breathtaking pace of its expansion -- nearly 10,000 employees have been hired since the casino opened in 1992 -- have made legal issues come to the forefront on the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation.


Red Sox, In First, Playing Catch-Up
Twenty-four hours after his club's challengers completed a whirlwind of trading activity, Dan Duquette sat in a room at the Otesaga Hotel in Cooperstown, N.Y., yesterday.
"The Red Sox are up here looking for some complete-game pitchers," the Boston general manager, in town for today's Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, said jokingly by telephone.
"They haven't been able to find them on the trade market so they're looking up in Cooperstown."

On the Civic Side of the Profit Motive
THE metal No Turns sign dangling from an overhead chain at 14th Street and Park Avenue South often flips in the wind and becomes invisible to drivers, who make the turn and get picked off by cops waiting in ambush.
Watching the sign sway, Rob Walsh said, "Sometimes I get so mad they don't fix that sign, I think I should hang out here and offer my services to drivers who get tickets."
Then came the Rob Walsh smile, that big, engaging, boyish, political smile that crinkles his tanned, handsome, puggy face.
It includes us in the absurdity of the "Mayor of Union Square" abandoning the high rollers of the current hot neighborhood to champion little people cruising in from the boroughs to buy bargains at Bradlees.


Lottery Prize: Permit to Paint
During years of police crackdowns that drove sidewalk artists from Greenwich Village, Times Square and Soho, many of them found refuge in Central Park.
There they set up easels to make quick portraits for pay.
But they lost that sanctuary a couple of weeks ago as the park became their latest battleground.
The police ordered the artists out and hauled one away in handcuffs on a charge of vending without a license.


Gowanus: Rougher Road Ahead; Highway Work Will Make It Worse Before It's Better
It would be hard to blame people in Sunset Park and Red Hook for wanting to turn back the clock, to reclaim western Brooklyn as it was before the soaring, noisy eyesore known as the Gowanus Expressway was rammed through their neighborhoods.
But the river of steel and concrete forced on another generation by Robert Moses in 1941 is about to become even more of an intrusion.


'Vice Versa'
To the Editor:
It is not a surprise to learn that Sir Frank Kermode, an eminent emeritus professor of belles-lettres, author of books on the Bible, the "classic" and Shakespeare, is uninterested in the topic of bisexuality and (therefore?) regards books on that topic to be unworthy of a literary scholar's attention.
What is a surprise is that The Times should have thought him an appropriate reviewer for my book "Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life" (July 9).
This is terra incognita for Kermode, as he is the first to admit.
He loudly proclaims his lack of interest and expertise in the field of human sexuality.
But he has agreed to review the book.


On Surviving a Move, Guinea Pig and All
THE guinea pig survived the move.
It was touch and go for a couple of days.
He sulked the whole weekend and wouldn't let us scratch his snout.
On Monday morning we found him limp and quiet in his cage -- kind of like a Democrat after last November's elections.
But we fed Pepper his pellets by hand, stuck the water bottle in his mouth and spoiled him with fresh alfalfa.
So Pepper came through the first week of the move.
And we did, too.
Goodbye, Bergenfield.

Bumpy Ride: A Faster Rail Link to Manhattan Runs Into Parking Problems
Like many residents here, Vicki Herzfeld Arlein is excited about the Kearny Connection, the rail link that will offer direct access to midtown Manhattan when it opens next spring.
But like many residents here and in other communities along New Jersey Transit's Morris and Essex Line, she is far from thrilled with the idea of a giant parking garage to accommodate new commuters, right in the heart of town.


Slaying of Connecticut Infant Shifts Policy on Child Abuse
In an eight-day period this spring, three small children in Connecticut died at the hands of adults they knew.
Outraged and revolted, particularly by the rape and fatal assault of 9-month-old Emily Hernandez, Connecticut abruptly changed the way it handled child abuse cases.
Since then, the state has become far more aggressive about removing abused children from their parents and placing them in foster care.
Connecticut officials have shifted their focus from the preservation of families, backing away from the philosophy that governs child welfare in at least 35 other states, including New York and New Jersey.

The Battling Borogh Presidents
Under zoning changes proposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, sex-related businesses would be prohibited from operating withing 500 feet of residences, schools and houses of worship, and within 500 feet of each other.

CLAIRE SHULMAN
"The zoning as proposed works for us. Of course, we'd like the 500 feet to be 1,000. But in essence, the bottom line is that what has been proposed will protect us more than we are currently being protected and we suport it and I believe it will withstand constitutional challenges.


Harry Zimmerman, Founder of Albert Einstein College, Dies at 93
Dr.
Harry M. Zimmerman, a pioneer in the study of diseases of the nervous system in the United States and a founder of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Friday at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, where he had trained a generation of neuropathologists.
Mr.
Zimmerman, who was 93, had also taught at Yale and Columbia.
In a varied career that produced hundreds of highly specialized research papers, Dr.
Zimmerman did seminal work on vitamin deficiency and the development of tumors of the nervous system at Yale in the 1930's; helped prevent the spread of parasitic diseases in the Pacific during World War II (his prescription being clean sheets), and while stationed on Guam with the Navy Medical Corps in 1945 and 1946 spurred a wave of new research into Lou Gehrig's disease when he discovered an extraordinarily high incidence of the malady among the native population.

Sexual Assault Trial Puts a Chicago Congressman's Career on the Brink
Five days into the trial of a Chicago Congressman charged with sexual assault, obstructing justice and soliciting child pornography, a recording of a sexually explicit telephone conversation has cast a long shadow over the short career of a rising political star, while the woman who once claimed to be his victim sits in jail, refusing to testify.
Representative Mel Reynolds, a Democrat elected in 1992 from the Second Congressional District, is accused of having sex with Beverly Heard when she was a 16-year-old campaign volunteer, and of trying to get lurid photographs of a 15-year-old girl.


Has Anyone Examined Artificial Reefs?
Although some shortsighted individuals might disagree, maintaining the integrity of Fire Island and the other barrier islands' fronting the unpredictable Atlantic Ocean is of vital importance to the South Shore of Long Island.
Without those thin ribbons of sand, a whole lot of people and hundreds of millions of dollars of prime real estate would be placed directly in harm's way.
Powerful storms are one of life's harsh realities, and Long Island has seen its fair share of them.
One can only imagine the destruction the likes of a Hurricane Gloria might bring to the South Shore without the protective buffer.
On the other hand, the present expenditure of both government and private funds that address the problems of littoral erosion on Long Island is nothing short of being penny wise and pound foolish.
Millions of dollars are currently spent annually on beach and dune renewal projects that are nothing more than stopgap measures, which do not solve the core problem, the Atlantic Ocean.
A long-term presence requires a long-term solution.

7 Years Later, Housing Plan Lags in Yonkers
SEVEN years after elected officials here agreed in Federal Court to remedy the practice of banishing minorities to public-housing ghettos, only 200 poor black and Hispanic families have moved from the drug-torn streets of the west side to the green tracts of the city's predominantly white east side.
Moreover, the name calling, blaming and squabbling among politicians and other civic leaders that marked the early days of the Federal desegregation lawsuit against the city continues.
After seven years, 800 units of affordable housing mandated by the court have yet to be built.

NEW YORKERS &amp; CO.
Louis Vuitton's Itinerary Sends Laura Ashley Packing Laura Ashley closed its New York flagship store, at 21 East 57th Street, on Wednesday after its landlord failed to renew the lease.
The landlord, Starre Realty, hopes to use the site, between Fifth and Madison Avenues, for an office tower of 15 to 25 stories, with retail space on the ground floor.
It has also bought up the two buildings next door, 17 and 19 East 57th Street, to use as part of the high-rise parcel.
Starre is a new partnership formed by Robert Siegel, president of Metropole Realty Advisors (which had owned 21 East 57th Street), and Michael Burke, the president of Louis Vuitton, N.A.
Plans call for Louis Vuitton, the luggage maker, to close its only Manhattan store, on 57th between Madison and Park Avenues, and move into 4,600 square feet in the new building.


The Iron Duke's London House Reopens
Apsley House in London, once the home of the first Duke of Wellington, has reopened after a three-and-a-half year, $9.6 million restoration.
Built by Robert Adam between 1771 and 1778, Apsley House is also known as No. 1 London, because it was once the first house beyond the toll gate at the entrance to the city from the west.
The house and most of its contents were given to the nation by the seventh Duke of Wellington in 1947, and it was opened to the public as a museum in 1952.

Previously, the hotel had 415 rooms and suites.
Standard rooms will be about 375 square feet.
Twenty rooms will be available for disabled guests.

A QUESTION FOR: Robert Rulon-Miller
Q: Is there going to be a collector's market for electronic books and the "new media" in the future?
A: People are more likely to collect programmer's notes for software.
Whoever developed Wordperfect had to have some notations, and that sort of material might be collected.
But I wouldn't think that the disks themselves would be.
I suppose that when Norman Mailer leaves his archives, he will be leaving disks, and if you could get your hands on a disk that had the unfinished novel on it, that would be worth something.
The question is, would the disk itself be worth something or would the little electrons be worth something?
Norman Mailer's markings on the disk's label would certainly make it worth more.

To the Editor:
Your July 23 article reported that the trucks avoiding the New Jersey Turnpike to save on toll money are creating serious safety and quality-of-life problems for the people in the communities through which they drive.
The problem is that tolls are the wrong way to finance roads.
The right way is to raise the gasoline tax.
Fairness would not be an issue, since heavier road users would inevitably pay more.
And any tax increase would be calculated to preserve our price advantage with New York and Pennsylvania.

"I think we have something uniquely attractive here to offer Deion," Jones said after a recent practice at St.
Edwards College here.
"Deion being a legitimate two-sport athlete would greatly enhance his earning potential off the field here. Plus, playing for a team with the stature of the Dallas Cowboys, who are one of the leaders in retail marketing in the N.F.L. and a very popular team, would help him. A high visibility athlete could definitely benefit from that."


Flavor and Texture in Vietnamese Salads
SALADS are very much part of the cooking of Vietnam, much more so than in other countries of Southeast Asia.
Even their spring rolls are salad-like, made with large leaves of lettuce rolled around a filling and served cold instead of deep-fried in dough.
At Le Colonial, a Vietnamese restaurant at 149 East 57th Street in Manhattan, the salads are among the most popular dishes on the menu, even in winter, because they are so refreshing.
They are light but highly spiced, combining interesting contrasts of texture and flavor.
The chef, Viet Tran, who is from Saigon -- he worked at Indochine before going to Le Colonial -- uses traditional ingredients like fresh mint, coriander, cucumber, bean sprouts and iceberg lettuce, which adds crunch.
The salads can be prepared ahead of time and put together at the last minute, which makes them great for summer entertaining.

An Irish Bishop's Words on Priestly Celibacy Prompt a Furor
A prominent Roman Catholic bishop has been ordered to the Vatican next month to explain his insistence that the church in Ireland should have an open debate on the requirement of celibacy for priests.
The dispute has set off widespread contention in Ireland, where 95 percent of the country's 3.5 million people are members of the church.
It has been front-page news since early June as the bishop, Brendan Comiskey, and the Primate of Ireland, Cahal Cardinal Daly, have exchanged volleys in newspaper articles and interviews.
Call-in radio shows have taken hundreds of calls on the issue.


Blocking A Co-op's Sale
To the Editor:
Your article on June 25 about setting floor prices for a co-op and headed "Blocking Co-op Sales" demonstrates the paranoia affecting many co-op boards and their shareholders regarding co-op prices.
They appear to have overlooked the fact that the value of anything is determined eventually by supply and demand.
The low selling price of a given unit does not create the market, but is rather a product of market forces.


The Nation; The Budget Knife Boomerangs Home
FOR many people here, this has been one of the saddest and most anxious weeks of waiting in decades.
The largest county government in America, is facing a potentially disastrous budget gap, and the Los Angeles County supervisors are deciding how to dismantle not just their social, health and other services, but their ideal of what a government should be.
It appeared that nearly 40 walk-in clinics, spread mostly in poor neighborhoods, would disappear.
More than 15,000 county workers would lose their jobs and many social and welfare programs probably would be slashed beyond recognition.

Lyrical Sentiment
To the Editor:
James R. Oestreich's otherwise excellent article "At Peace in the Lonely Realm of the Oboe"  [ July 9 ]  neglected to mention Sylvia Fine's trenchant opinion of that remarkable instrument in her hilarious patter song "Anatole of Paris," as sung by her husband, the comedian Danny Kaye:
An oboe, it is clearly understood, Is an ill wind that no one blows good.
LEONARD KIAN  Grand Rapids, Mich.


Speak Up for Harry Wu
China now claims that the American human rights activist Harry Wu has confessed to falsifying information in two television documentaries on the Chinese prison system.
The claims, made in a report by China's official news agency, Xinhua, and a videotape sold to news agencies by a state-affiliated firm, cannot be independently assessed at this point.
The tape shows a haggard Mr.
Wu telling four interrogators that a number of scenes in the British Broadcasting Corporation programs were falsely or misleadingly identified.
But nowhere does he say that he was personally involved in any misrepresentations in the broadcasts.
Nor does he admit to the more serious charge of espionage on which he is now being held.
The BBC defends the accuracy of its two programs and plans a detailed rebuttal.


A Short-Term Solution For the Route 31 Foul-Up
To the Editor:
As a commuter who regularly travels Interstate 287, it was obvious when the northern stretch was opened that truckers would use it to avoid tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike, with the resulting overcrowding of Route 31 in Hunterdon and Mercer Counties ("Truckers Carve a New Route, Crowding a Two-Lane Road," July 23).
Since the politicians and highway engineers seem at a loss to deal with this mess, here is a modest proposal for a short-term solution.

WESTCHESTER GUIDE
FILM DISCUSSIONS
Mount Kisco and Mamaroneck have been chosen as the locations of three New York Film Salons.
Harking back to the literary, musical and art salons of Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries and the Algonquin Round Table of the 1920's in New York, these get-togethers are inspired solely by movies.
Jackie Lent, the New Yorker who produces these and other cultural events for adults, has run 40 film salons in Manhattan.
A list of almost three dozen films used to fuel the fires of discourse include "The Age of Innocence," "Shadowlands," "Forrest Gump," "Muriel's Wedding," "Priest," "Crumb," "The Bridges of Madison County" and "Il Postino."


Fifty Years Later, Still the Day After
THE MANY TELEVISION programs surrounding the anniversary of the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, confirm that the questions left by the Aug. 6, 1945, blast are at least as long-lived as radioactive fallout.
Did the atomic bomb have to be used in the way it was, where it was?
Did it have to be used at all?
After a half-century, the dispute rages.
In recent months, a Smithsonian Institution exhibition on the Enola Gay, the American airplane that carried the bomb, was severely cut back after protests by veterans' groups and members of Congress who contended that the show was loaded against the United States.


Young, Carefree and in Love With Cigarettes
Fifteen-year-old Amber Davis took a long drag on a Marlboro Light, rocking in a swing as the sun set and she surveyed the bedlam of carnival rides and live rock music at the Great Texas Mosquito Festival, an annual bash in this Gulf Coast refinery town.
"It's a social thing, I guess," the freckle-faced Miss Davis said of her smoking habit -- currently 10 cigarettes or so a day.
"And besides," she said, gesturing to the lighted Marlboro, "I'd like to be a model. This burns off a lot of calories."


Jennifer Adams, Robert Traenkle
Jennifer Adams, the daughter of Eileen Meldrum and the stepdaughter of Bernard R. Meldrum of New York, was married yesterday to Robert Kurt Traenkle, the son of Christine and Robert H. Traenkle of Furlong, Penn.
The Rev.
Louis Padovano officiated at St.
Joseph of Yorkville Roman Catholic Church in New York.


High Court Ends Appeals By Tenants
The United States Supreme Court has refused to hear an appeal to safeguard the rent of nine tenants who live at Federally owned apartment building on East 57th Street.
Tenant advocates say the decision is significant because it is the first time that a Federal agency has been allowed to suspend state-established rent control.


New Face in the Urban Jungle
THOSE funny faces staring back at you in the Central Park Zoo's rain forest exhibit are the city's latest addition to its urban jungle: four black lion tamarin monkeys, among the world's rarest primates.
The adult tamarins, two males and two females, were born in Brazilian zoos and arrived last week at the Central Park Wildlife Center/Zoo, which is the first North American zoological park to join international conservation efforts to save this species.
But the zoo isn't taking all the credit.


Curtain Raisers In the West 40's
CAFE UN DEUX TROIS *  (212) 354-4148; 123 West 44th Street; $$; all major credit cards
The atmosphere here is as close as you will get to a fashionably threadbare and lively French brasserie, and the simple bistro cooking remains reliably satisfying.
The short, straightforward menu includes starters of country pate, ravioli Provencal, baked snails in garlic butter and a mixed green salad with a good vinaigrette.
Among the main courses are a nicely done charred steak with pommes frites; steak tartare with a piquant taste of Tabasco, also served with fries; warm roasted chicken; calf's liver served with grilled onions, and your choice of omelets.
For dessert, creme caramel and profiteroles are both good. (Review: 4/5/91; revisited: 6/2/95)  CARMINE'S *  (212) 221-3800; 200 West 44th Street; $; American Express
With its sand-colored walls festooned with publicity photos, whirling fans overhead and neighborly tables, Carmine's dining room looks as if it has been around since vaudeville days.
The kitchen turns out a pleasing mix, essentially Neapolitan, with everything served family style.
Pizettes, or little pizzas, are a good way to begin.
Toppings change daily and might include fennel sausage, tomato, garlic and mozzarella.
Other pleasing starters are the enormous plate of fried calamari served with a tomato dipping sauce, and a mixed salad platter combining greens, mozzarella, tomatoes and roasted peppers.
Popular entrees include rigatoni with sausage and broccoli in a ripe tomato sauce; porterhouse steak topped with an earthy sauce of tomatoes, sweet peppers and onions; grilled swordfish; a grilled pork chop and lobster fra diavolo with shrimp and clams in a spicy sauce over linguine. (Review: 9/25/92)  CHEZ JOSEPHINE **  (212) 594-1925; 414 West 42d Street; $$; all major credit cards
On any given night, this theatrical bistro rivals some of the most entertaining productions on and off Broadway.
You never know when someone will burst into song or hammer out show tunes on the piano.
The earthy bistro fare is prepared with care.
For starters, the Chinese ravioli with goat cheese and toasted pine nuts is always pleasing, as are baked snails in garlic butter, and salad of endive with crumbled Roquefort and walnuts.
This 27-year-old brick-walled tavern has always been known for its buoyant bar scene and simple American fare.
Framed Broadway posters and other theater memorabilia make up the decor, and the dining room is separated from the bar by brick arches.
Salads are a good way to begin, whether the sprightly assembly of grilled portobellos, tender spinach and sweet fennel or the generous plate of endive, watercress, Roquefort and walnuts tossed in a well-balanced vinaigrette.
Other starters include black bean soup, asparagus vinaigrette and fried chicken wings.
For main courses, the kitchen turns out a perfect calf's liver with steamed spinach and buttery whipped potatoes, nicely charred sirloin steak with crispy fries, grilled lamb chops with ratatouille, meatloaf with mashed potatoes and a good house burger. (Review: 8/19/88; revisited: 7/20/95)
LATTANZI *  (212) 315-0980; 361 West 46th Street; $$; American Express
A welcoming family-run restaurant in the heart of Restaurant Row, Lattanzi delivers fresh, tasty pasta and sprightly salads in a low-key setting.
One of the highlights is a menu featuring the cuisine from the ancient Jewish ghetto in Rome.
The best-known dish from that tradition is carciofi alla giudea, or tender artichokes sauteed with garlic and parsley.
Other good starters include a tasty shrimp and arugula salad vinaigrette and a combination plate of eggplant that is first fried then marinated in a sweet combination of vinegar, sugar, olive oil and tomatoes.
The plate also includes fresh mozzarella and suppli al telefono, a Roman specialty that is essentially a ball of mozzarella coated with a risottolike mixture, then rolled in bread crumbs and fried.
Recommended pastas include porcini ravioli, and herby linguine with white clam sauce.
Among the entrees are grilled lamb chops with rosemary and braised shanks of beef with polenta. (Review: 6/23/89; revisited: 7/17/95)  LE MADELEINE

High-Fashion Frolic
STANLEY Donen's FUNNY FACE (1957) is summer caviar, sprinkled with golden Gershwin and stardust: Audrey Hepburn as a bookshop mouse transformed into a glamorous model, Fred Astaire as a magazine photographer and Kay Thompson (in photo, left, with Astaire and Hepburn) as the magazine's madcap editor.
Musical numbers like Thompson's opening "Think Pink" and the trio's "Bonjour, Paris!" from Roger Edens and Leonard Gershe also sparkle.
SUNDAY at 8:30 P.M. and SUNDAY/EARLY MONDAY at 2 A.M. on AMC.

Tour Fugitive
To the Editor:
It's unfortunate that readers were subjected to such a biased article as Linda Wolfe's "Fugitive From a Tour Group" (June 4).


Wiggles Wiggles Out of Bankruptcy


A Father's Gift, a Mother's Victory
IT was a meeting of two people whose lives might never have crossed but for a strange constellation of timing, tragedy and fate.
On one side was a father who experienced the tragic death of his daughter.
On the other was a young woman who saw her own dreams for the future evaporating when she faced an unexpected pregnancy in high school.
Despite the darker circumstances that brought them together, the day they met was one of hope and regeneration.


Bonilla Off to a Slow Start With Orioles
White Sox 7, Orioles 4
Bobby Bonilla failed to hit a ball out of the infield last night in his debut with Baltimore, and the Chicago White Sox received two homers from the ex-Oriole Mike Devereaux in a 7-4 victory at Camden Yards.

Giants' Randolph Carves Out His Corner
Thomas Randolph was asked if last season he was a tad cocky.
"I'm cocky last year, this year, every year," he said today, "and I'm going to be cocky. That's the position I play. You can't be passive. You can't let people run you over and dog you. This is my corner, my island. You aren't going to get on my island. That's the attitude I have. You aren't scoring on me. So, yes, I'm cocky."


Hearings in Congress Draw Fans to the TV
Diners at the Varsity, this city's landmark fast-food restaurant just north of downtown, have a choice of five television rooms where they can have their chili dogs, onion rings and frosted orange drinks with side helpings of soap operas, talk shows or, on these hot July days, Congressional hearings on Whitewater and Waco.
"I'm interested in them because you don't get the clear facts by reading about it or listening to what politicians say about it," said Edward Lloyd, a 51-year-old air-conditioning technician from Marietta who, working in Atlanta for the last few days, has been visiting the restaurant as much for the television fare as for the lunch.


POSTINGS: It's One of the Biggest, 393 Feet Tall; At Navy Yard, The Crane Is Flying
Building the $400 million Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration power plant is a big job, and it's taking one of the biggest cranes in the world to do it.
"It's the first time the city ever certified a crane this large," said Robert F. Bitteker, the site manager.
"You can build a small skyscraper with it."


Susan Smith Verdict Brings Relief to Town
Every day at 12:25 P.M., the local radio station broadcasts obituaries of the county's dead.
People here say the program is one of the most popular, because it tells who is still among them, and who is not, in a way that is respectful and concise.
The murder trial of Susan Smith turned that small-town custom on its head, making the drowning of two little boys a centerpiece of daily life in Union for too long.


Open House
WILLIAM TURNBULL JR.
KNOWS ABOUT NATURE AND ARCHITECTURE.
Thirty years ago, he was one of the designers (along with the late Charles Moore) of Sea Ranch, a cluster of shingled beach sheds so essentially modest and in sync with their environment that they redefined the meaning of vacation architecture.
Turnbull hasn't lost his knack for squeezing high drama out of simple structures.
Only this time, instead of condos on windswept bluffs overlooking the Pacific, he has built a more idiosyncratic retreat for his family burrowed into a sloping valley of Northern California.
Here, even the view from the kitchen sink (of the rugged peaks of Mount St. Helena) is spectacular.


Honors Studies Shine at Community College

Each year about 100 students take part in the honors program at Westchester Community College in Valhalla.
Many of them credit that program with introducing them to new subjects and stimulating their interest in college-level work.

Don Carpenter, 64, a Novelist Who Wrote About Bleak Lives
Don Carpenter, a novelist and sometime screenwriter whose unflinching examinations of disheveled lives won more critical acclaim than popular favor, took his life on Thursday in a tiny, cluttered apartment in Mill Valley, Calif., where he had lived, worked, raged, exulted and suffered for the last 15 years.
He was 64.
Hailed as a serious literary figure from the moment his first novel, "Hard Rain Falling," was published in 1966, Mr.
Carpenter, whose later works included "Blade of Light" (1968), "Getting Off," (1971), "A Couple of Comedians," (1979) and the movie "Payday," (1973), had not published a novel in six years.


Beyond the Fine Prose: the Stuff of the Writer's Life
GREAT RESEARCH LIBRARIES are expected to own great books and documents.
When the New York Public Library displays, say, its manuscript of T. S. Eliot's "Waste Land," it's business as usual.
Less well known, however, is that distinguished libraries often possess remarkable objects: the hair, teeth, bones, shoes, glasses, luggage, desks and bizarre personal effects of famous writers.
The New York Public Library owns Howard Moss's plastic pencil sharpener and fragments of Percy Shelley's skull.
It also owns Elizabeth Barrett Browning's slippers, which do, in fact, explain something about her life.
Measuring nine inches long and, at their narrowest, one inch wide, they seem way too small for feet that could support a standing adult.
"We figured out why she never got off the sofa," said Lisa Brower, acting curator of the library's Berg Collection.


ON THE BORDER OF LIFE
I suffered through dark memories while reading Darcy Frey's " 'Does Anyone Here Think This Baby Can Live?' " (July 9), but I believe that the physicians involved in this situation conducted themselves with wisdom, grace and sensitivity.
In 1980, I gave birth to a 1-pound, 12-ounce baby at a major teaching hospital in New York City.
Had I been informed of the very real risks of permanent, devastating handicaps possible in babies of this small size, I may have changed many of the aggressive, medical decisions I then approved.


News Gathering; The Press: Bought and Sold And Gray All Over
THE Gannett Company, the biggest newspaper company in the country, bought another 11 daily newspapers last week.
Gannett already owned 82 dailies with a total daily circulation of more than 5.8 million.
Not long ago, sales of newspapers to business behemoths had journalists and critics anguishing loudly about concentration of media power in a few grasping hands.
Yet Gannett's purchase of Multimedia Inc. of Greenville, S.C., barely provoked a peep of protest.


Custom Tours Explore Berlin's Culture
Visitors to Berlin who are interested in the city's cultural offerings can arrange customized tours and meetings with people in the fields of music, literature, art and architecture through a service called Culture Trip.
An itinerary prepared for supporters of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, for example, begins with a briefing on the political and cultural ramifications of German unification.


CLINTON AND DOLE BIDDING TO BREAK WELFARE IMPASSE
President Clinton and Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, will offer competing proposals on Monday to overcome a political impasse that has stalled welfare legislation for two months.
The two men are scheduled to outline their proposals in speeches to the National Governors' Association, meeting in Burlington, Vt.
Gov.
Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican who is the group's incoming chairman, said he would work to line up support for Mr.
Dole's plan.


'Vice Versa'
To the Editor:
Frank Kermode's bumptious review of Marjorie Garber's "Vice Versa" alternately sniggers and snorts but never gets its old-boy prose around any (not a one) of the points made in that brilliant and central book.
Kermode may be as out of sympathy with cultural studies as the G. L. Kittredge and Harry Levin school he cites -- and as ignorant.
But Kittredge and Levin have the excuse of being dead.

In a Class Alone
To the Editor:
When Holland Cotter compares Nubian art with Egyptian art, as he does in his essay "Art of Old Nubia Opens a Window to a High Culture"  [ June 25 ] , and views the Nubian output as "no less sophisticated" than that of the Egyptians, he does both cultures a disservice.


Amy Scott, Andrew Vanecek
Amy Lydia Scott, the daughter of Dickson and Lydia Scott of Wallingford, Conn., was married there yesterday to Andrew Joseph Vanecek, a son of Carol Vanecek of Scarsdale, N.Y., and the late Joseph Vanecek.
The Rev.
John Sosnowski performed the Episcopal ceremony at the Choate Rosemary Hall Chapel.
The bride, 31, is keeping her name.
She is a graduate of Choate.
She received a bachelor's degree from Colby College and is a candidate for a master's degree in teaching at Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Conn.


President Powell? Not Just If, but Why?
COLIN L. POWELL'S greatest qualification to be New York City's schools chancellor may be that he graduated from Morris High School in the Bronx.
But that hasn't diminished the separate boomlets for his candidacy launched by people who don't agree about much else.
"I'm not saying the board has to select a business person, or has to select a person who's run another Government agency," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the other day, urging school board officials not to consider only educators.
"Let's say, Colin Powell, who you probably couldn't get, probably wouldn't be interested, maybe isn't the right person, I don't know. But let's say someone like that."


Passing A Co-op Interview
FOR Benjamin Lee, an 89-year-old resident of Florida, the experience was harrowing.
Mr.
Lee and his son, on a visit to New York City earlier this year, were summoned to a meeting.
"I'll never forget it," Mr.
Lee said.
"We were led up to a kind of storage space. There were two men sitting at a table. Behind the table was a curtain. A third man came into the room, turned on a tape recorder, and then started asking me about my income tax. It was like a Star Chamber."


Yes, I Love New York City. And You Can Charge That.
FANS of the Chicago Bulls have a credit card.
So do the members of the American Assocation of Retired Persons.
Now people who love the Big Apple may get one, too.
Partly to raise revenue and partly to promote itself, the city is discussing a credit card program.
Eight companies have submitted proposals, said Deirdra Picou, a spokeswoman for the Mayor's office, which is on the lookout for ways to bridge the budget gap.
"It's not a new idea, but we don't know what to expect," said Ms.
Picou, who pointed to similar programs in Detroit, Newton, Mass., and South Orange, N.J.
These cities, along with thousands of other organizations, are part of a boom in the credit card industry known as affinity marketing, which took off in the early 1980's.


Tennis Legends Ready to Compete in Rye
PICTURE this: you and your doubles partner, Jimmy Connors, competing on center court at the Westchester Country Club against Bjorn Borg and his partner.
Fantasy?
No.
Fact, if you're willing and able to pay $2,500 for the experience.
Don't despair.
There are other opportunities for tennis fans when the Champions Tour returns to the Westchester Country Club in Rye for what will be the second yearly Citibank Champions Tournament Aug. 8 through 13.
In addition to watching top players hotly competing in singles and doubles matches, there will also be the chance to take part in one of 20 clinics held by the players each day.
An hour and 50 minutes of instruction from the likes of Mr.
Borg and others costs $250, said Karen Scott Happer, the tournament director.


Flavor and Texture in Vietnamese Salads
SALADS are very much part of the cooking of Vietnam, much more so than in other countries of Southeast Asia.
Even their spring rolls are salad-like, made with large leaves of lettuce rolled around a filling and served cold instead of deep-fried in dough.
At Le Colonial, a Vietnamese restaurant at 149 East 57th Street in Manhattan, the salads are among the most popular dishes on the menu, even in winter, because they are so refreshing.
They are light but highly spiced, combining interesting contrasts of texture and flavor.
The chef, Viet Tran, who is from Saigon -- he worked at Indochine before going to Le Colonial -- uses traditional ingredients like fresh mint, coriander, cucumber, bean sprouts and iceberg lettuce, which adds crunch.
The salads can be prepared ahead of time and put together at the last minute, which makes them great for summer entertaining.


A Short Course on Jewelry and the Human Body
IMAGINE A WALK-IN JEWEL BOX with all the earrings neatly arranged in pairs, the bracelets sorted, the tiaras and hatpins placed together, the buckles lined up in rows and the necklaces spread out to reveal all their glitter.
Such exquisite orderliness would be the envy of most women.
Yet it can be found in "Body Language: Jewelry and Accessories," an exhibition at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum through Aug. 20.
The 200 pieces from the museum's collection range from a beaded Egyptian necklace made in 1,000 B.C. to an epaulet of gold wire cubes made in the Netherlands in the 1990's.
They offer a short course on what these pieces have meant to people of varied cultures and why jewelry is worn on different parts of the body.


Tort 'Reform' Is a License to Steal
There is a bitter, poignant moment in "Richard II" that could explain everything about the catastrophe that is unfolding in the realm of securities law protection.
In the play, Richard, the legitimate king, is about to be deposed by the well-armed upstart Bolingbroke.
Trying to pretend that his grab for power is a legitimate lineal claim, Bolingbroke says something about "deserving" to have the crown.
Richard Plantagenet interrupts him by saying, "They well deserve to have that know the strongest and surest way to get."


An Old-Fashioned Troupe, and Proud of It
TO the best of my knowledge, no theater in the country is doing what we're doing," says Warren Kliewer.
He backs up his sweeping statement with corroborative references to a scholarly publication (the Cambridge Guide to American Theater) and to the Theater Communications Group, the national service organization for nonprofit professional theaters.
"Not that I want to be narrow-minded or doctrinaire about it," he adds, tempering bravado with modesty.


Of Dates and Chandeliers At a Faded Landmark Hotel
To the Editor:
Your article about the Alexander Hamilton ("Paterson Hopes Hotel's Rebirth Will Lead the City's Way," June 25) was informative, but I should point out that the hotel opened in 1925, not 1930.
The damaged ballroom chandelier in the photograph accompanying the article, incidentally, was there in 1925 and is an adaptation of 18th-century lighting fixtures.


After Three Months on the Job, France's President Exudes Elan
In barely three months as President of France, Jacques Chirac has cultivated a macho image that is the envy of far younger leaders, like President Clinton.
After the French leader made a dramatic call for American and British support for stronger military action against Bosnian Serb attacks on United Nations "safe areas," one Administration aide in Washington said, "Some people in the White House are absolutely convinced that Chirac is grandstanding to make Clinton look bad."


The Summer Festivals: A Platform for the Bold
THIS YEAR, AS USUAL, IT IS mainly the summer dance festivals outside New York that have revealed significant new talent and experimental choreography from abroad.
New York may still lay claim to being the dance capital of the world: no other city plays host to as many performances and companies, both foreign and domestic.
Qualitatively, the dancers on view are no slouches either.
Yet in the 1980's it was the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., that introduced Americans to unknown phenomena like Butoh, Japan's neo-expressionist dance-theater, and France's "new dance" choreographers, including Maguy Marin.

Tales From the Sky
FROM where Frank Kind works, sidewalks look like gray chalk lines, billboards are the size of postcards and Central Park is a tidy mosaic of bonsai trees and bushes.
When he is perched on a scaffold 45 floors above the cement sidewalk, Mr.
Kind, 58, doesn't think about his brother-in-law Harry Heller, who fell from a scaffold and ended up with one leg shorter than the other.
And he never looks down.
"I just pay attention," he said, "to what I'm doing."


Cigarette Maker Not Responsible For Fire Deaths, Judge Rules
These are tough times for tobacco companies, but recently they won one in court.
In 1981, Dana Griesenbeck's parents and brother died in a Montclair fire when her mother fell asleep while smoking and the cigarette ignited the couch.
Ms.
Griesenbeck sued the American Tobacco Company, arguing that the company should have produced a self-extinguishing cigarette.
She also contended that the company should have warned smokers that cigarettes are not only hazardous to one's health but can also cause fires.


Whose Beach Is It?
Should New Jersey's beaches be open to everyone, or should towns have the right to restrict access?
A Question of Fees
The coastal areas should be accessible to everyone as a national resource.
But there is an economic element to this controversy: the question of access fees.
While undeveloped coastal areas should be open and free, developed sections such as maintained sand beach facilities and boardwalks can justify a fee to recoup expenses on a nonprofit basis.
KENNETH A. CROSSNER  Somerset Don't Drive Tourists Away
Hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans and out-of-staters visit our beaches every year.
If we take away their access, they will spend their money elsewhere.
And let us not forget that the state of our waters and beaches was not solely created by the beachgoers but also by lax corporate and Government standards of years gone by.
MARY BUYOFSKI  Perth Amboy High Cost of Visiting
I am in absolute agreement that the New Jersey coast should be off limits to those of us who are not privileged enough to own a half-million-dollar beach house or drop 3 grand in rent for two weeks "down the shore."  TRISH VANNI  Ewing  The Best Beaches
I just returned from a stay in Ocean City, Md., and I have stayed at many beaches along the East Coast.
The Wildwood beaches are the absolute best.
What are they doing right down there?
ERIC HOWARD  Somerset  Sharing the Shore
While I can understand the concerns of those who live in beach towns, there are many more towns that do not have the availability of beaches.
Garden State residents should have the absolute right to enjoy all the wonderful beaches throughout the state.
If this access is prohibited, what's next, a law that only residents, not visitors, can travel through or be in their town?
SHIRLEY FRAZIER Paterson Share the Burden
Tax money needs to be allocated to bear the costs of maintenance, but that burden should be shared, as should the sands.
Legislators who promote tax money for beach replenishing should also work for equal access.
JUDITH OWENS  Brick  Fees Are Too High
One of the things I absolutely hate about New Jersey is the concept of having to pay for access to the ocean or beaches.
When I lived in California, I could go to any beach any time for no fee because the beach is all public land.
The pay beaches have lost my tourist dollars forever.

Medicare, to Survive, Needs an Affluence Test; Driving Up the Costs
To the Editor:
"A Bold, Imperfect Medicare Plan" (editorial, July 25), on the Republican proposal to use vouchers in Medicare, makes an assumption that is universal in discussions of health care reform: that the price of care is the cost of care.


Eleanore Griffin, 91; Screenwriter Shared 'Boys Town' Oscar
Eleanore Griffin, a Hollywood writer who shared an Academy Award for a story that became part of a political debate more than half a century later, died on Wednesday at the Motion Picture and Television Fund Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif.
She was 91.
In a career that extended from the 1930's to the 60's, Miss Griffin wrote or helped write such movies as "St. Louis Blues," "Good Morning, Miss Dove" and "Imitation of Life," but by far her most significant work was "Boys Town," the 1938 movie in which Father Flanagan, a compassionate Roman Catholic priest (Spencer Tracy) runs a school for a group of endearing juvenile delinquents led by Mickey Rooney.


Christopher Links Summit Talks To China's Release of American
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, significantly raising the pressure on China, said today that "it would be very difficult" for President Clinton to hold a summit meeting in October with China's President, Jiang Zemin, unless the Chinese Government first releases Harry Wu, an American citizen charged with stealing state secrets.
Mr.
Christopher made his remarks to reporters as he flew to Brunei for a meeting of Asian foreign ministers and the first meeting with his Chinese counterpart since relations between the Washington and Beijing began to deteriorate.


Increase ad rates while cutting circulation? Seems like a good idea to Hearst.
NINETY-DEGREE weather notwithstanding, the summer doldrums in the magazine industry vanished instantly last week after Hearst Magazines dropped a bombshell.
Citing "unprecedented paper and postal cost increases," Hearst said it would cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers an average of 10 percent at 13 of the company's 15 magazines.
The only exceptions were Marie Claire and Smart Money, which are joint ventures.


Discord Rattles Co-op City Towers; Feuds and Finances Threaten Stability of Middle-Class Refuge
The very idea of Co-op City sounds idealistic, even friendly, like a gigantic concrete commune in the Bronx on the Hutchinson River.
It is the largest cooperative housing development in the country, with 55,000 residents who own shares of the sprawling development.
They are not called tenants or renters or even partners -- they are "cooperators."
Lately, however, "gladiators" would be more fitting.


Avid Technology (AVID,NNM) reports earnings for 2d qtr to Jun 30


Software Hype and Hopes
It is not a lunar landing or the cure for disease.
It is simply an improved version of a computer's operating system - like a more efficient transmission for a car.
But 100 million personal computers use the Microsoft Corporation's software.
And on Aug. 24, when Microsoft begins selling a new version of Windows, a multibillion-dollar economy will be set in motion.
Besides deciding whether to buy the $100 Windows 95 software itself, consumers and corporations will need to consider whether to spend hundreds of dollars more on hardware and software that takes advantage of it - or thousands more to buy whole new machines.
Meanwhile, the Justice Department is still considering whether or not to try to prevent Microsoft from including access to its new on-line service in Washington.
Coverage begins on page D1.


For Amicable Discourse on 'Huckleberry Finn'
To the Editor:
Re your July 25 report on the important conference on "Huckleberry Finn" at the Mark Twain House in Hartford: The issue of race in "Huckleberry Finn" is uncomfortable for black readers, as it should be for whites.
The Mark Twain House should be commended for making it a subject for amicable discussion, rather than a shouting match, as it has been in too many cities in recent years.
It is encouraging to see black academics in the discussion in Hartford, among them David Bradley of Temple University, who for several years has added a voice both sensitive and informed to the debate.


Man Charged in Dealer's Killing
A man from Piscataway who prosecutors said left a cache of coins -- including one valued at $14,000 -- at his mother's house has been arrested and charged in the robbery and shooting death of a coin dealer from South River, the A.P. reported.


In D'Amato Book, Dodging Is Artful


Windows of Opportunity for Microsoft
REDMOND, Wash.
The Microspft Corporation plans to begin selling its 272d software title on Aug. 24.
But it is clear that Windows, 95, the latest version of the software that runs some 100 million of the world's personal computers, is much more than just another new product.
Windows 95 is a sign of the times, already creating a stir in markets worldwide, in Washington and on Wall Street, an indication of the inroads the personal comptuer has made into contemporary commerce and culture.
A video producer is churning out five million copies of a Windows 95 tape, convinced that sales of an instructional video on a software program will dwarf those of past best sellers, like the Cindy Crawford workout tapes.
The test versions of the software that Microsoft has been circulating for months have received microscopic scrutiny, not only for technical flaws but even for political slights.
One version had a map with a misdrawn Latin American border, bringing fiery protest from Peru, which is in a border dispute with Ecuador.
Meanwhile, the Justice Department is racing to decide whether to stop Microsoft from using Windows 95 as a springboard for the company's new on-line service.
And the surge in stock prices this year has been led by technology companies, partly in anticipation of increased sales of computer hardware and software that analysts expect in the wake of the Windows 95 introduction on Aug. 24.
Should sales of the new Microsoft program lag behind expectations, the stock market may well tumble.
The fascination, hype and controversy surrounding Windows 95 stems largely from the fact that PC's are now ubiquitous in the workplace and are fast becoming a mainstream consumer product.
The $85- billion-a-year personal computer industry is recognized as a pillar of the American economy.
And as a gateway to the Internet, cyberspace and multimedia, the personal computer affects everything from how people communicate with each other to how children are educated.
Even Brad Chase, the 34-year-old architect of Microsoft's marketing strategy for Windows 95, says he is amazed by all the attention the product has received.
And he readily admits that the phenomenon is only partly explained by the big-budget marketing campaign he has led for the last year from Microsoft's pine-covered corporate campus here, outside Seattle.
"The breadth of interest in Windows 95 is because of all these things, from the Internet to the Justice Department investigation, coming together, all these stars getting into line at once," Mr.
Chase said.
"Windows 95 is a lot more than software."
And how is a single software program linked to all these larger trends and events?
Simply put, because Windows 95 is a new operating system and because it is Microsoft's.
An operating system controls the on-screen look of a personal computer and the keyboard-and-mouse steps required to use it, and more than 80 percent of all PC's use Microsoft's operating software.
So when Microsoft overhauls its operating program, it is changing the language of personal computing.
Windows 95, by all accounts, is the most significant change Microsoft has made in its operating program since 1990.
That was the year the company introduced its first Windows system, which borrowed an approach from Apple Computer's Macintosh by enabling a user to point and click on graphical icons instead of typing arcane commands.
Since then, Microsoft has improved Windows, notably with its Windows 3.1 version in 1992.
But Windows 95 is an entirely new operating system built with 11 million lines of programming code, compared with 3 million lines for Windows 3.1.
All operating systems have their irritating quirks and shortcomings, and Windows 95, priced at less than $100, is no exception.
Some existing programs do not yet run smoothly on Windows 95, and it requires more computer hard-disk space and memory to use than the previous generation of Windows.
But analysts agree that Windows 95 represents a big step forward in making computers less confusing for someone writing a report, browsing the Internet or installing a new printer.
Technology purists point out that some of the new features of Microsoft's new system, like being able to have lengthy file names instead of the eight-character limit of Windows 3.1, are advantages that rival operating systems -- the Apple Macintosh and I.B.M.'s OS/2 -- have had for years.
Yet even with a technical edge, Microsoft's competitors have not been able to challenge the company's dominance of the operating system market, which it attained shortly after I.B.M. chose Microsoft's Disk Operating System for the I.B.M.
PC in 1980.
By now, in the PC operating system market, Microsoft has no genuine rival.
The company's extraordinary marketing campaign, with an estimated budget of $150 million, is intended less to fend off competition than to move computer companies and users -- quickly -- to the new industry standard, Windows 95.
"For Microsoft, the marketing campaign is essentially a $150 million insurance policy to make sure that nothing happens to prevent Windows 95 from becoming by far the most successful product in the history of the business," said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
If Microsoft makes Windows 95 a success, it will have plenty of help from the rest of the personal computer industry.
Dataquest, a market research firm, estimates that in addition to Microsoft's $150 million, other hardware and software companies, retailers and distributors will spend $350 million this year to market Windows 95 and their own Windows 95-related products.
Other software makers, in particular, tend to have a hate-you/need-you relationship with Microsoft.
As the dominant producer, Microsoft makes not only operating software but also applications like word processing programs, data bases, spreadsheets, educational software and games.
So it is the chief rival of most applications-software companies in the industry.
But because the software makers' products run on the Microsoft operating system, they have been rushing to develop products for the new Windows 95 platform.
A successful rollout of Windows 95 in the early months is vital to Microsoft, both to its corporate pride and its profits.
Analysts' sales estimates vary considerably for the last four months of 1995, following the Aug. 24 debut.
At the high end, Dataquest is forecasting sales of 29 million copies this year.
International Data Corporation, another research firm, predicts 20 million.
Another firm, Inteco, estimates it will be only 14 million.
At roughly $50 in revenue to Microsoft for each copy sold, the difference between a torrid and a not-so-fast rollout could make a striking difference in near-term revenues and profits.
Selling 29 million copies this year means roughly $1.45 billion in revenue to Microsoft, while 14 million copies would be $700 million.
Responsibility for seeing that the Windows 95 marketing goes quickly and smoothly rests largely on the shoulders of Mr.
Chase, the general manager of Microsoft's personal systems division, and seven group product managers.
They are all men in their early 30's -- seasoned veterans by Microsoft standards.
They are mainly M.B.A.'s from places like Wharton, Harvard and Northwestern.
Most started in other fields, then recognized that technology was the future, and headed to Redmond.
Mr.
Chase wrote the marketing blueprint one night, shortly before a March 1994 meeting with Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman.
It sketched out what Mr.
Chase called the "E-strategy" for Educate, Excite and Engage, and it explained that the personal computer market has broadened so much since the introduction of Windows 3.1 in 1992, nearly tenfold, that an entirely different approach was needed this time.
And different it has been.
The company has distributed 400,000 beta, or test, copies of Windows 95, many of them to corporate users licensed to put the software on more than one PC.
By Aug. 24, an estimated million people will have used Windows 95 for nearly 75 million hours.
This means that even before it officially hits the market, Windows 95 will have received more use than all but a few of the most successful software products receive in their entire several-year product cycles.
For more than a year, Microsoft has been bringing software developers, PC makers, corporate customers and members of the computer press to Redmond for briefing and cajoling.
The company presented demonstrations to 50,000 individual customers during a 23-city, three-month tour of the United States..
Microsoft sent the finished code for Windows 95 to factories on July 14.
And the company has revved up seven times its normal production capacity, contracting with 12 plants and engaging a fleet of 500 trucks, to insure that the new product will be at 20,000 retail outlets, from CompUSA to Wal-Mart, on Aug. 24.
Consumers are expected to move quickly to Windows 95, particularly since it will be preloaded on the machines produced for the Christmas season by manufacturers like Compaq, Packard Bell, Gateway and Dell.
But corporate customers traditionally wait six to nine months to buy new operating systems, allowing the early programming bugs to be eliminated.
To try to get companies to move quickly this time, Microsoft and distributors have offered large customers hundreds of free copies as an incentive to buy others.
Companies that have agreed to deploy Windows 95 on many desktops by Aug. 24 include Ford, Dow Chemical, Sprint and Deloitte Touche.
Yet it seems doubtful how quickly even the Microsoft marketing arsenal can prompt companies to move to Windows 95.
Surveys show most companies would wait until next year to make the transition.
"There's no question about it," Mr. Chase said, "inertia is our biggest competitor."

In Somalia, a Chameleon Thrives
A millionaire businessman, reputed arms dealer and drug trafficker, self-styled diplomat and peacemaker, Osman Hassan Ali has his own private army in Somalia.
But as he limps into the lobby in Nairobi's Intercontinental Hotel, wearing a jacket and striped shirt and clutching a crutch in one hand, he hardly raises an eyebrow.
Accompanied by only one bodyguard, Osman Ato, as he is widely known (Ato is a nickname that means "skinny"), has come for coffee and a chat with an American Embassy official.
The get-together is part of a whirlwind of meetings on Somalia's future that occupy much of his time these days as he commutes in and out of Mogadishu.


N.F.L. TRAINING CAMP REPORT
Broncos Edge 49ers
The analytical mind of Denver Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan has no room for sentiment.
Shanahan, who helped the San Francisco 49ers win a Super Bowl during his three-year stint as offensive coordinator, beat his old team, 9-7, in his Denver debut Saturday night in a National Football League preseason opener at Mile High Stadium.
Asked how he felt going against his former players and coaching colleagues, Shanahan could think only in terms of X's and O's.
"Mentally, it really wasn't tough because I've had a chance to go over this game for several months," Shanahan said.
"Because I know their personnel, I could anticipate some of the calls. A couple of times when they audibled, we knew what they were going to do because the terminology we use is the same."

Sports of The Times; Both New Inductees Sound an Alarm for Game
IT was a day when all should have been right with the world and with baseball in particular.
It was a day in which the sun was bright and a huge, spirited crowd created what appeared to be a sea of red caps in sprawling Clark Field to honor a pair of Philadelphia Phillies and those two stars -- Mike Schmidt and Richie Ashburn -- who were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
And yet on this day, a note of alarm was struck.
By both Schmidt and Ashburn.
"The game," Schmidt said yesterday, "has reached a crossroads. Take a look at the empty seats in ball parks and the empty ball fields in playgrounds. It concerns me, and for those in baseball, it should scare you."

"I had some good hacks," he said.
"I've had four opportunities with runners in scoring position and I've struck out twice right-handed. That's unusual."

Editorial Notebook; Can Merger Save the Unions?
The merger announced last week between the auto workers, steel workers and machinists unions reflects weakness, rather than revival, of organized labor.
The three large unions, which total about two million workers, are rapidly losing members, revenues and political clout.
Like corporations in trouble, unions too grab at mergers for survival.
The numbers are staggering.
Over the past 20 years, membership in the auto workers' union has shrunk by half, to about 800,000.
The steel workers' union has fallen by about 30 percent, the machinists by 40 percent.
There are many reasons, mostly beyond the unions' control.
Competition from abroad and a 20-year slowdown in productivity have stripped unions of their power to raise wages.
Manufacturing, the traditional bastion of union organizing, continues to slip behind hard-to-organize service industries.
The Federal Government under Presidents Reagan and Bush did little to enforce laws that protect labor's right to organize.

The latest in your survey of Japanese curiosities (news article, July 27), about some Japanese consumers' obsession with "germ-free" cleanliness and the products that inspires, suggests a conscious effort to trivialize Japan.
Recent articles have poked fun at a variety of things Japanese, such as the push for success in competitive university examinations, public school students who scrub the halls and toilets of their schools, the high prices of domestically grown fruit and the inability of narrow Japanese streets to accommodate oversize American cars.
These articles are attention-getting and can be said in some ways to humanize Japan for American readers.

Joffrey Drops Chicago Merger Talks
Merger talks between the newly named Arpino Ballet (formerly the Joffrey Ballet) and Ballet Chicago ended on Friday, bringing to a close a quixotic plan that was intended to establish a home base for the financially hard-pressed New York company and to pool the resources, fund raising and repertories of the two troupes.
The talks failed because of continuing philosophical differences between the boards over fiscal planning, touring and the degree of integration of the companies, according to a statement released on Friday by the board of Ballet Chicago.
The two groups had been negotiating since last November.

How the Software and the Network Stack Up
SOFTWARE: THE DESKTOP
Many of the technological improvements in Windows 95 mimick characteristics long available in Apple Computer's Macintosh operating system and I.B.M.'s OS/2 -- particularly the use of visual icons and task bars to make it faster and easier to operate the computer.
All three operating systems now offer "plug and play," meaning that peripheral devices like printers and CD-ROM drives can be added with no need for the user to reconfigure the software.
With Windows 95, users can do this only with software programs created specifically for it.
Windows 95:
The start button summons the initial menu of options.
A sub-menu lets the user launch programs directly, instead of searching through several sub-directories, as the old Windows required.
Users can add frequently needed applications to the task bar that always appears on the screen.
Macintosh:
There are several ways to start programs and organize files on the Macintosh.
One way is the Apple menu.
Another way is the launch pad, which made its debut last year in System 7.5.
It is a round-up of icons for the user's most frequently accessed applications.
OS/2:
OS/2 also features a launch pad.
The software also integrates so-called drag-and-drop mouse commands, which make it easy to fax or print a document, simply by dragging the document icon to the printer or fax icon.
FILE MANAGEMENT
With the Windows update, individual files are now handled much the same way in all three operating systems.
The differences lie in efficiency.
OS/2 offers true "multi-tasking," which means that the computer can perform several tasks simultaneously.
Windows 95 offers true multi-tasking only when all of the programs in use are ones designed specifically for the new Windows.
Otherwise, tasks like sending a fax can slow down other operations.
Windows 95:
The user can organize the files into folders and sub-folders of his or her choosing, displayed in a tree-and-branch format.
Individual files created in the same program are all represented by the same icon, for easier visual identification.
Macintosh:
Windows 95's file-management approach is similar to the Macintosh's.
Macintosh's visual desktop setup uses icons to represent the hard drive and other components, as well as a trash can for deleting files.
OS/2:
Files are organized in folders as icons, as shown above, or using the tree-and-branch motif.
INTERNET ACCESS
Unless the Justice Department intervenes, Microsoft plans to offer direct access to its new Microsoft Network and to the Internet through Windows 95.
Apple offers Internet access through its own eWorld service.
OS/2 offers Internet access through I.B.M.'s network.
Windows 95:
This is the Microsoft Network's E-mail screen.
While most users choose services based on their content, they actually use plain-Jane tools such as E-mail most frequently.
OS/2:
The OS/2 interface allows for full use of the Internet, including the World Wide Web.
A user dials into I.B.M.'s systema and the comptuer is automatically configured to use E-mail, the Web and other tools.
THE NETWORKS: A COMPARISON
On Aug. 24, the same day it begins selling Windows 95, Microsoft also plans to enter the on-line business with the Microsoft Network, known as MSN.
Tables show how it will compare with the current leaders.
MICROSOFT NETWORK LAYOUT
Designed to be fully integrated with Windows 95, the Microsoft Network uses a visual navigation system very similar to that of the operating system.
The network's on-line customer help and support service will also handle user questions about Windows 95.
THE OPENING SCREEN -- Offers access to the five areas on the network.
CONTENT -- The usual potpourri of chat rooms, film reviews and information.
Some 100 content providers have signed up, including NBC News, the retailer Eddie Bauer and the basketball star Shaquille O'Neal, with ShaqWorld Online.
NEWS MSN -- Today offers news bits, as well as information about the service, and provides links to other areas on the network.
HELP AND REGISTRATION -- Provides on-line customer service for the Microsoft Network and allows customers to make changes to their accounts.
On-line support for Windows 95 and other Microsoft programs is available through the Categories area.

Boyz II Men, the Gentlemen Lovers for the 90's
Some five hours into the show at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night, professionalism finally reared its head.
Boyz II Men appeared, and for the first time in the long and plagued concert, a group managed to make it convincingly through a song and managed to stay on key.
Boyz II Men, the best-selling vocal group in the world, has spent money on choreography and staging, and with their clean and romantic sexuality, they slayed the girls in the audience, of which there are plenty.
The concert, featuring the singers Montell Jordan, Mary J. Blige and the group TLC -- some of the best-known names in pop music -- should have been an event.
It wasn't.

It will also have cross-promotions with retailers and marketers of related products.

Bracing for a Microsoft Onslaught, Apple Sees No Reason to Panic
In Silicon Valley it is fashionable to predict that the imminent arrival of Windows 95 spells the ultimate demise of Apple Computer Inc.
A growing chorus of pundits and Wall Street analysts has zeroed in on Apple and its home-grown operating system as the biggest potential losers in the wake of the introduction, due in late August, of the Microsoft Corporation's updated computer operating system.
Apple popularized the personal computer in the late 1970's and made computing much simpler with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.
But its lead in simplicity will be narrowed by Windows 95.

SENATE COMMITTEE STARTS RESHAPING HOUSE BUDGET BILL
Less than two weeks after a raucous House approved a $23.2 billion spending bill crammed with political trouble, the Senate has begun quietly but methodically stripping the measure of its most controversial provisions on abortion, AIDS education, the Mexican peso and the outright abolition of offices in the core of the Democratic White House.
The House's efforts drew headlines and loud debate on the floor of Congress.

Yanks Surpass .500 With a Little Help From Twins' Defense
The climb back was a long, tough one and surely at times seemed impossible to traverse.
But the Yankees tonight finally did what they could not for over two months: break above .500, thanks to the generous Minnesota Twins.
The Yankees defeated the once-mighty Twins, 7-4, tonight.
They did so thanks to the fielding of the Twins, who this weekend treated the Metrodome like a chamber of horrors and any ball hit by the uncanny Mike Stanley as untouchable.

TENNIS  Agassi Tops Sampras
Top-ranked Andre Agassi rallied for a 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory over No. 2 Pete Sampras yesterday in the final of the du Maurier Ltd.
Open in Montreal.
Agassi, who successfully defended the hard-court title he won last year at Toronto, recorded his 400th career victory, seventh among active ATP Tour players.
With the on-court temperature at 104 degrees, Sampras broke Agassi's service for a 4-2 lead that helped him win the opening set.
But Agassi raised his game in the second set, while Sampras began to struggle with his serve.
Agassi broke for a 4-1 lead in the second set and broke to lead by 3-1 in the third.

CROATS CONFIDENT AS BATTLE LOOMS OVER SERBIAN AREA
On this muggy weekend, as the threat of war sent families of American diplomats packing, residents of this sleepy capital went about their normal lives today, going to Mass, buying vegetables at the open-air market and seeking relief from the heat on the pebbly beach at Lake Yarun.
It is not that they were oblivious to rumblings that war with the ethnic Serbs in their country was imminent, but rather that they were eager for it, and diplomats here believe that they will get their wish.


Abroad at Home; Is Reality Dawning?
In the minds of many Americans there has been a strange disconnect between the radical Republican program in Congress and its consequences.
People like the idea of smiting the Government without understanding what the slashing and burning would do to them.
I noticed it several weeks ago in the response to a column that looked at the likely consequences.
I foresaw a country with wetlands disappearing, air and water increasingly polluted, food and drugs unsafe.
To my surprise, readers asked where I got such ideas.
I got them from the precise terms of legislation pending in the House or already passed.


Partition of Bosnia Would Reinforce Injustices
To the Editor:
In "A Realistic Entity: Greater Sarajevo" (Op-Ed, July 26), Ronald Steel tries to prove himself a big friend of a smaller Bosnia.
But, like other apparently "realist" proponents of partition, he ends up making excuses for ethnic cleansing without giving any reason to think that capitulation would end the process.
"The Serbs have largely achieved their territorial goals," he instructs us, before proceeding to the corollary that fresh territorial concessions must now be made -- by the Bosnian Government!
This blurring of distinctions launches him on a risky re-evaluation of recent history.

On a Sticky Night, Mozart, Cooling Brow and Brain
In the dog days of New York summer, Mostly Mozart is air-conditioning for the soul.
It soothes; it comforts; sometimes you barely notice it's there.
Friday's edition at Avery Fisher Hall, with the Mostly Mozart Orchestra under Gerard Schwarz, provided another evening of relief.
Challenge was deferred to a cooler season.
Mozart -- darkly beautiful, deeply sophisticated -- gave satisfaction.
Beethoven's "Ah, perfido," waggled its angry finger of accusation, just as it has for precisely 200 years.
An overture and aria from Simon Mayr's "Medea in Corinto" introduced to many listeners a thoroughly forgettable composer, but then again, it may take occasional remembering to forget the forgettable with any finality.

Enigma of a Nobleman, Pretender to Femininity
MONSIEUR D'EON IS A WOMAN A Tale of Political Intrigue and Sexual Masquerade
By Gary Kates
Illustrated. 368 pages. Basic Books. $25.
The title of Gary Kates's savory story of politics, espionage and sexual fakery is a quotation from an 18th-century French nobleman passing along a piece of gossip to a British friend.
But, it should be noted, it was a false piece of gossip.


A Threat to Media Diversity
The telecommunications bill that the House will vote on this week takes a good idea -- deregulation -- and carries it to destructive extremes.
It promises consumers a wider choice of cable and telephone companies.
But it risks putting local phone companies in a position to drive rivals out of business.
It could also end up concentrating control of the main media outlets -- newspaper, TV and radio -- in too few hands.
The bill, written by Republicans and mirroring legislation already passed by the Senate, would affect nearly everyone by altering the telephone, television, cable and, perhaps, newspaper industries.
These industries have poured tens of millions of dollars into lobbying campaigns to sway Congress.
The local phone companies have contributed the most and seem to have won the most.
But the victories by the regional Bell companies are not necessarily victories for the consumers.


Israel to Ask U.S. to Yield Palestinian
The Israeli Government decided tonight to seek the extradition of a Palestinian detained last week in the United States.
The man, Mousa Mohamed Abu Marzook, is said to be a senior leader of Hamas, the militant Islamic group that has waged a campaign of deadly attacks against Israel.
The decision to request his extradition came after talks among Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and senior justice and security officials.

Baltimore Journal; Japanese-Style Booths Put Police at the Center of the Action
The little booth sits just off a downtown intersection that once stood at the retail heart of the city, with large department stores, movie theaters and fashionable restaurants.
In recent years, with one street a pedestrian mall and the other reserved for buses and commuter trains, the neighborhood has become a collection of specialty shops and stores for the budget-conscious.
But as the neighborhood struggles to stay vibrant without the tourist appeal of other downtown attractions like Oriole Park at Camden Yards and Harbor Place mall, few buildings seem to be as vital to the area's well-being as the small booth.
It is known as a koban, a police substation modeled and named after similar buildings used in Japan as part of that country's law-enforcement policy of stationing officers among the people they protect.

China Hints Move to Settle Islands Dispute
China insisted today that it had "indisputable sovereignty" over a chain of potentially oil-rich islands in the South China Sea but also opened the door to negotiating a settlement over their ownership.
The statements, made at a summit meeting of Asian foreign ministers in the sultanate of Brunei, were welcomed by Southeast Asian diplomats who had worried that the island chain, the Spratly Islands, could become a military flash point.


Treasury to Auction Bills This Week
The Treasury's schedule of financings this week is confined to today's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills.

In Lollapalooza, Stage Is No Barrier
It was easy to tell that Elastica was the new band of Lollapalooza, alternative rock's biggest touring package, which stopped on Saturday afternoon at Downing Stadium for the second of two shows in the stench of Randalls Island (there's a sewage-treatment plant nearby).
Taking the place of Sinead O'Connor, who dropped out of the tour to cope with her pregnancy, Elastica performed a consistent, straight-ahead set of two-minute songs probing the intersection between punk and new wave.
They didn't goof off, they didn't interact much with the audience and they thanked the crowd for being "lovely" (they're English).
This kind of set wouldn't seem out of place on other tours, but on Lollapalooza, a summer camp for alternative-rock stars, it seemed wooden.
Part of the appeal of alternative rock is that its performers emphasize that they are no different from their audience.
By Saturday, 25 days into the tour, Lollapalooza's bands were relaxed enough to imbue a grand outdoor space (filled with more than 20,000 people) with the casualness and intimacy of the small clubs that these groups normally tour.
At big concerts in the past, the stage has always been a barrier separating the artists from the faceless mass of fans, and that border was never crossed except when an audience member eluded security or a performer hovered over the crowd in a cherry picker or another protective device.


After a Raid, Ball Bearing Manufacturer Back at Work
Two aircraft ball-bearing factories in western New York, which shut down on Friday after Federal agents raided them as part of an investigation into defective parts, resumed limited production yesterday.
The owner of the two factories, MRC Bearings, said it hoped to be back in full operation by Friday.
But first it must copy all the documents seized by Government officials last week because the documents detail the specifications needed for manufacturing the bearings, said Allen G. Belenson, general counsel for MRC Bearings' parent company, SKF USA Inc., based in King of Prussia, Pa.
The American parent is a subsidiary of the Swedish company SKF.

Beeson's Gritty Tale of Danger and Longing
Those who think the heritage of American opera is impoverished should have been at the Museum of Modern Art on Friday night.
As part of the Summergarden series examining American music during the 25 years after World War II, Jack Beeson's one-act chamber opera "Hello Out There" received an arresting concert performance by splendid musicians from the Juilliard School, with Joel Sachs conducting.
The 40-minute opera for three singers, which Mr.
Beeson wrote in 1953, when he was 32, is a testimony to his early operatic expertise.
The libretto, adapted from a William Saroyan play, tells of a dashing and dangerous young gambler who is charged with rape and jailed in a small Texas town, and of a lonely young woman, the jailer's daughter, who is drawn to him.
The story is somewhat dated, and in certain ways so is the music.
With its mixing of folkloric elements, hymnal harmonies and expressionistic modernism, the score harks back to all those gritty W.P.A.-sponsored operas about downtrodden Americans.


Waco's Unlearned Lessons
At the start of the hearings on the Waco catastrophe, it seemed possible that detailed testimony might show that despite appearances, the Justice and Treasury Departments had some idea of what they were doing.
Eight days of House hearings have only deepened the evidence that the military-style attack on the Branch Davidian compound was badly planned on the ground and recklessly approved in Washington.
Most alarmingly, Attorney General Janet Reno has professed to have learned nothing in the two years she has had to analyze the fiasco.


Governors Try To Find Unity On Medicaid
While welfare preoccupies Washington, the nation's governors are more worried about what cuts and changes Congress will make in Medicaid, and are searching at their annual summer meeting for a common position on how to alter the health care program for the poor.
Medicaid costs the states six times as much as welfare.
So while many governors are reconciled to what Democrats call "cuts" and Republicans call "slower growth" in Federal Medicaid spending, they are arguing intensely about formulas for distributing the money to the states and the need to reduce Federal directives on how it gets spent.

To Help Keep Mexico Stable, U.S. Soft-Pedaled Drug War
Soon after becoming President at the end of 1988, Carlos Salinas de Gortari sent his new drug-enforcement chief to help rescue Mexico's troubled relationship with the United States.
The official, Javier Coello Trejo, quickly formed a 1,200-member task force, seized tons of drugs and put the most-wanted cocaine smuggler in Mexico behind bars.
He brought the Government within reach of its broader goal, sufficiently impressing American officials with Mr.
Salinas's resolve to dislodge the drug issue as an obstacle to closer ties between the countries.


Hevesi Returns to Combative Mode of Old in a Challenge to Giuliani
During his first 18 months in office, City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi pursued a strategy that surprised some who recalled his more partisan, Republican-baiting days in Albany.
He decided that attacking a popular Republican Mayor would not earn him credibility in his new role as the distant, dignified and even dull steward of the city's fiscal health.
Then late last month, Mr.
Hevesi, for 22 years a liberal Democratic Assemblyman from Forest Hills, Queens, seemed to break dramatically from this approach: he vowed to block Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposed sale of the city's water system for $2.3 billion, a measure aimed at raising $400 million this year alone for construction projects.
The move represented an extraordinary use of the Comptroller's powers, and by Wednesday, when Mr.
Hevesi announced his final decision to block the sale, the issue had erupted into the first full-fledged fire fight between the two men that is now headed for court.

He trumps and dumps on the bad guys.
He is unforgiving of his enemies.
He takes deliciously nasty potshots at his critics and delights in parading as a populist, defending little people from the evildoers everywhere.

A Helicopter Quartet. What Else?
The German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen has long had a reputation for startling his followers, but his latest work has come as a bolt from the sky.
As part of this summer's Holland Festival, the composer staged the premiere of the Helicopter Quartet, written for four string instruments and, no less, four helicopters.
The work took off from a field on the outskirts of Amsterdam, at the Westergasfabriek, a former gasworks that has become a theater.
Here, in the gentle evening light last month, Mr.
Stockhausen said goodbye to the members of the Arditti String Quartet as each went off to his own helicopter and pilot.

A convicted sex offender who was registered with the local police has been arrested and charged with the sexual assault of a 15-year-old Toms River boy, the authorities said.
The police said that John Edward Greene, 28, lured the teen-ager to his room last Friday with an offer to escape the heat and watch television.
Mr.
Greene, who had been convicted of sexually assaulting a girl in Dover Township in 1991, was paroled in February.


Russians and Chechens Sign Partial Accord
After seven months of a war that has devastated much of Chechnya and damaged the course of Russian reform, officials for both sides signed a partial treaty today that they said would bring an end to the fighting.
"We have now legally confirmed the end of the war in Chechnya," said Usman Imayev, the senior Chechen negotiator at a news conference in Grozny, after signing a military accord there with his Russian counterparts.

O, the Torment! of Reciting Shakespeare
They sat in a semicircle, in T-shirts and shorts, reciting some of the most powerful dramatic lines ever written.

The Battle By the River Drags On
Donald Trump's long delayed plan for Riverside South, a $2 billion cluster of apartments and park land on the West Side of Manhattan, hit another snag last week when the House of Representives blocked the use of Federal funds to reconstruct part of the West Side Highway.
The measure, sponsored by Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a West Side Democrat who fiercely opposes the project, provoked a barrage of criticism.
The funds were to submerge the elevated section of the highway, between 59th Street and 72d Street, making way for a park with unimpeded access to the Hudson.


What Forced Goldwyn to Seek Sale?
In 1993, the Samuel Goldwyn Company was basking in the critical and box-office success of art-house films like Kenneth Branagh's "Much Ado About Nothing" and "The Wedding Banquet," directed by Ang Lee.
And the Goldwyn-produced syndicated television hit "American Gladiators," in its fifth year, seemed to be an enduring cash cow.
So why is Goldwyn, one of the last independent film distributors in Hollywood and a producer of mass-market television shows, now up for sale?

Tragedy of Pet Breeding
To the Editor:
Both sides in the debate over "munchkin" cats are missing an important point: It's silly, if not tragic, to breed ever more animals at a time when so many of those already born are destined to die homeless in a shelter or on the street ("A Cat Fight Breaks Out Over a Breed," news article, July 23).


Dr. Harry Zimmerman, 93, Dies; Founded Albert Einstein College
Dr.
Harry M. Zimmerman, a pioneer in the study of diseases of the nervous system in the United States and a founder of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Friday at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, where he had trained a generation of neuropathologists.
Dr.
Zimmerman, who was 93, had also taught at Yale and Columbia.
In a varied career that produced hundreds of highly specialized research papers, Dr.
Zimmerman did seminal work at Yale in the 1930's on vitamin deficiency and the development of tumors of the nervous system; helped prevent the spread of parasitic diseases in the Pacific during World War II (his prescription being clean sheets), and while stationed on Guam with the Navy Medical Corps in 1945 and 1946, spurred a wave of new research into Lou Gehrig's disease when he discovered an extraordinarily high incidence of the malady among the native population.

Members of 2 Unions Reject Contracts With Metro-North
The members of two unions have turned down tentative contracts with Metro-North Commuter Railroad, undoing a good portion of the progress made in talks this month and casting doubt on the prospects for quick settlements with other unions.
The votes by the International Association of Machinists and the International Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers undercut management's assertion that the tentative accords had established a pattern that the other unions and Federal mediators would follow.


Art for Whose Sake?: Trading in Antiquities; Rare Pre-Columbian Relics, at Any Cost
In a 15-minute videotape that tomb robbers in Guatemala are circulating among art dealers and archeologists, there are several views of a milky-colored limestone slab, about 4 by 5 feet.
It is the Cancuen panel, a sort of Maya Rosetta stone covered with hieroglyphic signs carved on it 1,500 years ago.
For $75,000, anyone can buy a chunk.
Actually, the Cancuen panel is priceless, a historically significant treasure that turned up during the present explosion of discoveries about the lost civilizations of Mesoamerica.
It is also indicative of a dramatic increase in the rampant and brazen looting of archeological sites in Central America that dates to the early years of the century.


BUSINESS DIGEST
In Congress, a Battle On Spending and Ideology  When a Senate Appropriations subcommittee picked up the $23.2 billion spending bill passed by the House, it excised a slew of controversial provisions advanced by House conservatives.
The Senate committee quietly stripped the bill of its ideology and cut spending by $175 million more.
The move would unite two of the largest companies in business forms, printing and labels.

In Packwood Ethics Case, Support From a Democrat
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior Senator from New York and a Democrat, has emerged as one of the chief supporters of Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican accused of sexual and official misconduct.
Mr.
Moynihan rose at a Democratic caucus meeting last week and told his colleagues that he supported Mr.
Packwood and that it was not the time for public hearings on the accusations.
He said any decision about what to do next should be left to the Ethics Committee, which is to resume its closed-door discussions of the case on Monday.


Queens Church Trip Ends in Fatal Crash Along the Thruway
They were the future leaders, the exuberant young promise, of their families and their Queens congregation, the nation's largest Korean Catholic church.
They had struggled to overcome immigrant hardships.
They labored happily for their community, excelled in education, were dedicated Sunday school teachers and camp counselors and were devoted to their faith and to one another.
But on Saturday night, as the 14 friends rode together on a weekend outing in the Catskill Mountains, their van swerved out of control and rolled over and over again in a nightmarish crash on the Gov.
Thomas E. Dewey Thruway near Kingston, 75 miles north of New York City.
Two were hurled from the tumbling vehicle and others were trapped in the mangled wreckage.


Metal Fatigue Is Suspected In Ride Wreck
Metal fatigue probably caused the calamitous failure of a Coney Island thrill ride Saturday night that injured 13 people, including a woman who nearly lost a part of her leg, city officials said yesterday.
The ride known as the Hell Hole, a name that proved eerily apt for a few terrifying moments, was inspected three months ago by the city's Department of Buildings and found to be sound.
But officials said it was unclear whether the inspectors had missed signs of impending disaster, or if evidence of a problem appeared too late to be caught.

Graham Knows He's No. 2, but Works Like a No. 1
Kent Graham looks more relaxed.
He got his hair cut the other day, and his blond spikes almost stand on end.
When someone joked he looks like a punk rocker rather than a pro quarterback, he laughed.
Graham can joke about these things now because there isn't as much at stake for him.
Last year was different.
He was in the fight of his career for the Giants' starting job.
And it was strange seeing the naturally light-hearted and warm Graham be so tense.
That isn't how he is now.
There is no question who is the starter and who is the backup.
