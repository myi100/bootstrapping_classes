And Now, a Few Words From Jenny Holzer
LEAD: ONE OF THE MOST UBIQUITOUS PRESENCES ON THE current art scene is a 39-year-old maverick named Jenny Holzer, a tricky impresario of language who makes words into visual spectaculars.
A writer who doesn't think the printed page is ''enough of a forum,'' Holzer hatches messages that range from deadpanned aphorisms to dark meditations about the human condition, embosses them on plaques, engraves them on marble or granite benches and sarcophagus lids and - with skilled technological choreography - sets them prancing in dazzles of colored light.

It includes novels, poetry, stories, biography, memoirs, letters, history, essays and science.

Willem Dafoe, Looking for Characters With Possibility

How did it feel to be there?
I expected to identify with the horror, to break down, but that would have been obscene.

Teachers and Others In a Bargaining Unit
LEAD: The article ''Broader Membership Is Giving Teachers' Union New Influence'' (Oct. 8) correctly judged that the inclusion in teacher bargaining units of such support staff members as school secretaries, instructional and noninstructional assistants, custodians and bus drivers has enhanced the bargaining power of the New Jersey Education Association and its affiliates.

TALKING: Home Papers; Saving Crucial Documents
LEAD: WHILE most people know that it is wise to keep records connected with owning a home, it is not so clear which documents, invoices, receipts, canceled checks and other items need to be kept and which can be discarded.

Flashes of barely veiled bosoms and expanses of flesh everywhere.
When the showings of the spring 1990 collections ended a month ago, the nude message -- though by no means the only news -- was certainly clear.
Even the most pronounced color palette emulated skin tones, ranging from deep browns to rosy peaches and palest alabasters.


Strung Up
LEAD: IT MIGHT JUSTIFIABLY BE called a cable car, but it is equally fitting that the device supporting the workmen who are replacing 177,000 feet of steel cable on the Brooklyn Bridge is known as a spider.
Unlike, say, the Williamsburg Bridge, just up the East River, which is supported by vertical cables, or other spans, which employ a system of diagonal stays, the Brooklyn Bridge has both.

LEAD: Following, as outlined by American officials, are the proposals made by President Bush today in his meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union:


Installing Shut-Off Valves in Pipes
LEAD: ONE annoyance frequently found in older homes, and sometimes even in homes that are not so old, is the lack of shut-off valves beneath plumbing fixtures.

INTOXICATED BY MY ILLNESS
LEAD: I feel intimidated by these tales of people who find the experience of having cancer to be a source of inspiration and personal growth.
I suspect that most ordinary mortals would fall short of this ideal.
I suspect that this presentation of critical illness as a path to growth through adversity gives a patient unreasonable models and is likely to encourage friends and family to react unsympathetically when one fails to measure up.


Edith S. Lynch Marries
LEAD: Edith Scott Lynch of New York and Nantucket, Mass., was married yesterday in New York to Philippe G. Bouriez of Paris and St.-Jean-de-Luz, Basses-Pyrenees, France.

PITCHING DOCTORS
LEAD: Every time I read another doctor-bashing article in your magazine, I wonder why you don't provide space for a rebuttal from the other side.

Physicians rely on their own experience, on other physicians' advice and on the literature.

LEAD: A EUROPE WHERE THE TRAVELER'S electric shaver can be plugged in and works regardless of country, where road signs are uniform and frontiers can be crossed without tiresome formality.

A Europe no longer of disparate, strange, even feuding countries, but one happy family of nations living in harmony and sharing a common culture.


CAN A NOVELIST SAVE PERU?
LEAD: Peru's coca problem and the rise of the Sendero Luminoso guerrilla movement are rooted in the fact that the central Government in Lima has not dealt seriously with the agricultural sector of the country.

Who Really Deserves Marshall Plan Credit
LEAD: To the Editor:


The Shaking Off
LEAD: A political earthquake sends East Europeans surging into the streets to shake off oppression.
The impulse is like the one that, two years ago this week, first sent Palestinians into the streets to protest Israeli occupation.
The intifada they call it - literally ''the shaking off.''

ON THE TELLY, A TALE OF SWAPS
LEAD: A RECENT MONDAY MORNING at Shane Longman, a mid-sized merchant bank in the City of London.
Phones ring, Reuters monitor screens flicker and, as a jittery bond market awaits the latest United States trade figures, Declan McConnochie, a senior bond trader, is especially jumpy.
Some doggy Japanese debt he's holding as a favor to another trader is blotting his performance record.


Two Die as Charter Fishing Boat Sinks
LEAD: A 110-foot charter-fishing boat sank in rough seas near the entrance to New York Harbor yesterday afternoon.
All 19 people aboard, including some women and children, leaped into the frigid water and were picked up by rescue vessels, but two later died, the Coast Guard reported.


Review/Film; Stories of Manhattan By Student Directors
LEAD: Short films are so pitilessly noncommercial that they become havens of freedom; film makers might as well give up any idea of reaching a large audience and do the most wildly inventive work they can.
The exception to this rule occurs in film schools, where fledgling producers, directors, writers and cinematographers put together brief films commonly known as ''calling cards'' to the industry, meant to show agents and producers that these students have become professionals.


Some Recollections of Dutch Schultz Era
LEAD: The fascinating article about Dutch Schultz and his demise (''Jerseyana,'' Oct. 8) reminded me of an incident during my employment as a film critic for The Newark News.

Montana
LEAD: To the Editor: We spent part of last summer in Montana's Glacier National Park and Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada.
As magnificent as the scenery was, we were equally impressed with the friendliness of Montana's residents, in particular, Don and Carol Young, the hosts of the bed-and-breakfast where we stayed in Kalispell, and felt that our find was too good to keep to ourselves.


Graduating Scale
LEAD: A lot of colleges give lip service to the notion of putting academics ahead of athletics.
The 12-school Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference says it is the first basketball conference to put its money where its mouth is.
Its sponsors' money, that is.

LEAD: Before a Giants-Eagles game two years ago, Buddy Ryan boasted that ''the only player that can catch Randall Cunningham in the league is number 56,'' meaning Lawrence Taylor, ''and I'm not sure he can do it this year.'' But in the final seconds of that game in Philadelphia, the Eagles' coach watched No.


Question Of the Week; Is There Bounty Hunting in The N.F.L.?
LEAD: Pro football is one of two sports (boxing is the other) where physical destruction of your opponents pays such big dividends that bounty hunters will soon be replaced by body counters.
Who orders it?
We do.
Every time we boo our losses.
Who pays it?
We do.
Every time we buy from television sponsors.

Fine Hi-Fi Roams the Midprice Range
LEAD: The Greek notion of the Golden Mean is having a rough time these days.
Our immoderate age, fascinated with the pursuit of outer limits, often takes a condescending view of the middle.
But at least in audio, the idea of intelligent moderation persists in the middle price range which, as a group, offers the best dollar value in stereo equipment.


St. John's Eases Into Final

Correction

Values Are the Means and the End
LEAD: For at least 25 years, we Americans have failed to instill basic values in our children, in the workplace, in government and in many other parts of our society.
We are simply not getting across such basic ideas as decency, fair play, courtesy, hard work, scholarship, perseverance, self-confidence, teamwork, discipline and a host of other character traits.


On the Scaffolds, a Delicate Labor in the Duomo
LEAD: The aluminum-shafted elevator slowly makes its 196-foot climb from the floor of the Duomo to the base of the 16-level scaffolding that rings the interior of Filippo Brunelleschi's cupola.

THE LITTLE INDUSTRY THAT COULD
LEAD: AT THE WAREHOUSES OF HARPER &amp; Row in Scranton, Pa., it was Christmas in September.

TOO POLITE IN A.C.C.
LEAD: Broadcasting basketball games on television is something I have become used to doing; speaking comes easily, but the written word is another story.
But the prospect of taking the Big East side in previewing the Big East-A.C.C.
Challenge was too good to pass.
I immediately called my buddy, Ray, who may, over the course of a season, watch more basketball games than most scouts I know.


Installing Shut-Off Valves in Pipes
LEAD: ONE annoyance frequently found in older homes, and sometimes even in homes that are not so old, is the lack of shut-off valves beneath plumbing fixtures.

Total Immersion in Golf's Traps
LEAD: EVERY duffer who plods the public links of the Northeast dreams of one day playing the flat, well-groomed, straight courses of the South.
We see them on TV during professional tournaments, and they look easy compared with the hilly, twisty, knobby fairways in the North.


Working Out, Body and Soul
LEAD: IT was barely noon of my first full day at Palm-Aire Spa, and I had already exercised more than I would have in a week at home: a two-mile walk at 7 A.M., a workout in the pool at 9, a toning class at 10 and aerobics at 11.
This was the general pattern of my visit last month to two Florida spas: In the morning I worked, and in the afternoon

LEAD: They took a bit of time to set up, but once Roger Brooks got his Maniac (Manually Activated Nonintegrated Audio Contraption), Madmass (Manually Activated Digital Multiple System) and Drastic (Dynamic Response Audio System Tandem Isometric Controls) going, a howling concatenation of bleeps and buzzes filled the room.


Installing Shut-Off Valves in Pipes
LEAD: ONE annoyance frequently found in older homes, and sometimes even in homes that are not so old, is the lack of shut-off valves beneath plumbing fixtures.
Shut-off valves permit turning off the water supply to individual fixtures like sinks, tubs and toilets without having to shut off the main water supply or large sections of household plumbing.

Fashion; Hats With a Sense of History
LEAD: Uptown or downtown, the newest hats combine warmth with whimsical historical flourishes, preferably those of old England.

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: The Garment District; Dressing Up Those Dowager Buildings

LAUGHTER, TEARS, THE PERFECTMARTINI
LEAD: Arthur Miller should be ashamed of himself for saying that A. R. Gurney is a perfectly good playwright even though he has never written a character like Willy Loman (''Laughter, Tears and the Perfect Martini,'' by Alex Witchel, Nov. 12).
Willy Loman was a great deal more than an interesting character.


Just Had Lunch? Sorry. Dinner Time!
LEAD: EARLY BIRDS are an acquired taste that you should cultivate if you're visiting your folks in Florida this winter.

Where All Is Rationed But Praise for the Leader
LEAD: With foreign delegates and journalists in town for this month's Rumanian Communist Party congress, it was standard practice for the Government to supply Bucharest's shops with goods so that reports of shortages could be exposed as enemy disinformation.


Abortion in the Court, Case by Case by Case
LEAD: THE more the Supreme Court considers abortion, the less urgent its deliberations seem.
There is no question that the Court can slash away at the constitutional right it established 16 years ago, but for this term, at least to judge from arguments in the two abortion cases before it last week, the struggle appears to come down to some pushing and shoving.


New Country
LEAD: Though she is only 21 months old, Alyssa Smith may already have received the most important gift she will ever get from her mother.

ART
LEAD: The price of books on art has been rising steadily, though by no means as fast as the price of some kinds of art at auction.
What $20 would have bought not so long ago may cost close to $100 today.
Sometimes it's worth it (always provided that we have the money).
Year after year, the catalogues of major exhibitions are the definitive studies of the works in question.


Nouveau Heights
LEAD: ACCORDING TO GEORGES Duboeuf, perhaps the bestknown of the Beaujolais shippers, the two greatest vintages in modern Beaujolais history were 1945 and 1976.
In a business built on hyperbole, Mr.
Duboeuf comes off as almost laconic.
So when he says, as he has been since September, that 1989 could be better than both those years, there just may be something to it.


Ms. Hoenig Wed To D. B. Maynard
LEAD: Kathryn Lee Hoenig, an associate at the New York law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft, and Douglass Bayley Maynard, an associate at the New York law firm of Patterson, Belknap, Webb &amp; Tyler, were married in New York yesterday by the Rev.

LEAD: I read Tamar Lewin's article  [ ''Ill Parents: Women's Burden Grows'' ]  the day after my television program on the same subject (''Caring for Your Parents: Mother in the Middle'') was shown on public-access television on the North Shore.

Patricia-Anne BarrettWeds Randal Martin
LEAD: At the Bedford (N.Y.) Presbyterian Church, Patricia-Anne Barrett, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

The Rev.
Dr.
Thomas A. Hughart officiated.


How Is a Mighty Instrument Fallen
LEAD: There is no music, it sometimes seems, only musics - subdivisions of the universal art of esthetically ordered sound that appeal to narrow constituencies, most of whom actively disdain the others.
But in two decades of wandering through this musical minefield as a critic, I have come across one embattled community that seems to be scorned by the rest of the musical universe.

Start out with a big fortune, goes the old joke among racers who have found that money goes fast when going fast.


INTOXICATED BY MY ILLNESS
LEAD: I recognized Anatole Broyard's experience.
I had it, too, on learning that I had cancer.
I think it comes from a sense of deliverance from the banal.
One can move on to a higher plane with a free conscience.
And though Mr.
Broyard's friends rally 'round, they do not really understand.
One feels impatient, as at a railroad station when one is about to start on a unique adventure and people come to see you off with the conversation of a cocktail party.


RETAILERS TAKE A TIP FROMTHE AIRLINES
LEAD: Retailing is frequency marketing's next frontier.
The Limited is rumored to be considering such a program.

A Majestic New 'Messiah' and Other Gifts
LEAD: This is the season to lose oneself in a good oratorio, to inhabit a distant realm where the frescoes of Giotto and Michelangelo spring to life, where prophets, saints and seraphim lift their voices to the accompaniment of massed choirs and where the sound of the orchestra has the sheen of sustained organ harmony.


Question Of the Week; Is There Bounty Hunting in The N.F.L.?
LEAD: Yes.
Buddy Ryan said he wasn't ''paid enough to dish out that kind of money'' to reward his players for vicious hits.
Apparently Ryan had been paid enough in the past since his monetary bonuses of $100 or more to players after games are well documented.

LEAD: To the Editor:


CONJURING UP THE 1990's
LEAD: SOOTHSAYING HAS A long and checkered history, and the year-end predictions of economic soothsayers generally fare no better than the rest.

The Non-Microwave Cooking Advantage: Timing

First of all, this time-saving device cannot provide a short cut to the peeling, shopping and so forth, that is often necessary before the cooking starts.


Abortion and Religion Put Focus on Election
LEAD: Under normal circumstances, the race for the California State Senate in the 39th District here would be an obscure one with few voters turning out.


Pastimes; Aroung the Garden
LEAD: For This Week: If old flower stalks of perennials are still standing, cut them to near ground level.
Don't forget to move hoses inside and shut off outdoor faucets for winter.
Also, the power tools should be cleaned and stored, especially mowers.
Apply anti-desiccant sprays any time this month to conifers, rosebushes and broadleaved evergreens to cut down on drying out; the colorless material wears off in a few months and may need to be re-applied in February.


THE WORLD: The New Europe; Eleven Months of Peaceful Revolution
LEAD: HARD as it is to remember today, only a year ago many countries of Eastern Europe remained the essence of gray Communist orthodoxy.
But the rigid foundations of party dictatorship were already being eroded by deepening economic malaise and the reformist policies of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
In a startling shift, the Soviet leader made it clear that Soviet tanks would not enforce the old order as they had so often in the past and that, in the satellite countries at least, an end to the

Review/Dance; Fable of Gods and Men, To Music by Hovhaness

PITCHING DOCTORS
LEAD: In the last 18 months, I have turned down two all-expenses-paid trips to drug-company symposiums in Bermuda and in Vancouver, B.C. (spouse invited, too), and countless free dinners at the finest restaurants in town.

The Rev.
Arthur O. Bice, an Episcopal priest and a grandfather of the bridegroom, officiated.


Japanese Players Take the Grand Tour
LEAD: The orchestra's European tour this fall was typical - late planes and buses, missing luggage, irregular meals, a customs check that held up the larger instruments, but also the pleasures of making music and friends.
A typical tour for a symphony orchestra - but this was not a typical symphony orchestra, even though the principal conductor, Seiji Ozawa, is well known in Europe and helped to attract large, appreciative audiences.


Campus Life: Middlebury; Broad Revision In Social Structure Is Recommended
LEAD: If the Middlebury College Board of Trustees makes changes proposed by a college-appointed task force, the fraternity system here will be swept away as part of a broad revision in the college's social structure.

LEAD: ''It drives me up the wall.'' ''It's like someone hitting me with a hammer.'' ''It grates on me; it's like hearing a fingernail run along a blackboard.''


PEARLS
LEAD: Waste no pity on pearls, they are more popular than ever.
First Lady Barbara Bush's penchant for wearing the fake variety and the renewed interest in Chanel accessories have made them best sellers.

Mediators Given Time to Resolve Lebanon Standoff
LEAD: Lebanon's warring factions backed off from a head-on military confrontation today to allow time for mediators to break a political deadlock that has threatened to plunge the country into another round of violence.


TRAVEL
LEAD: Like experimental novels in which the technique or approach take the place of plot or character, there are now travel books in which the vehicle is the thing and the place or people are secondary.
Like modern paintings, these books suggest that we've already seen the world, and now it's best looked at from a kayak, a rubber raft or balloon, in what Willem de Kooning called ''slipping glimpses.

It's jobs.

No-Show Decision

Biotechnology Poised for Breakthroughs
LEAD: ''THIS lab is bugged,'' reads the hand-lettered sign on the door of Eugene Premuzic's laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton.
The bugs in question are not transmitters for clandestine eavesdropping, but micro-organisms for cleaning up toxic geothermal energy byproducts.


A Cautionary Guide for Little Customers
LEAD: Television commercials for children are not kid stuff.
About $500 million a year is spent promoting toys, games, foods and other goodies to young consumers.
There may be two sides to the question of whether any advertising is appropriate on programs aimed at grade-schoolers and under, but nobody is likely to take public exception to the principle that youngsters should not be fooled by adults.


DEFINING SOME WORDS TO WORK BY
LEAD: THEY PORED OVER BUSINESS periodicals, interviewed hundreds of executives, conducted a nationwide survey - all in pursuit of the words that represent ''the language of current managerial practice.''

With Joe Lovano on soprano saxophone and Mr.

Using arrangements by Mr.

Notes From a Prompter's Box On Making Opera Sing

A sampling of the films (most of which run about an hour) suggests that several are models of innovative documentary film making, while in many others flabbergasting images fight with the sort of droning voice-overs that give documentaries a bad name.

Mitterrand, in Kiev, Warns Bonn Not to Press Reunification Issue KIEV, U.S.S.R., Dec. 6 (Reuters) -President Francois Mitterrand of France warned West Germany today not to push for reunification with East Germany, saying it could upset the delicate balance in Europe and slow integration of the European Community.   Speaking after talks here with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, Mr. Mitterrand, who last month said ''I am not afraid of reunification,'' made it clear that he and the Kremlin leader agreed that stability in Eastern Europe was a major priority.   ''We must avoid at all costs anything that could poison what is already a very complex situation,'' Mr. Mitterrand told a joint news conference that was remarkable for the apparent similarity of French and Soviet views on German reunification.   ''None of our countries, and especially one whose weight is so great and whose geographical position is such, can act without taking into account the balance of Europe,'' he said in a clear reference to West Germany. Backing for the Status Quo    Mr. Mitterrand's remarks contrasted with those he made last month in Bonn after meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany.   ''I am not afraid of reunification, '' Mr. Mitterrand said then. ''I think the desire for reunification is legitimate for the Germans. What counts above all is the determination and will of the people.'' Since then, Mr. Kohl has outlined a 10-point vision for eventual German reunification. Mr. Kohl presented the outline to the West German Parliament last week without prior consultation with the Western allies, and his ideas drew expressions of concern from some North Atlantic Treaty Organization members, including France, during President Bush's briefing in Brussels on Monday on his weekend meeting in Malta with President Gorbachev.   The French President, in Kiev on a brief visit to discuss the results of the Malta summit meeting, also expressed his support for a Soviet proposal to hold a 35-nation conference on European security as early as next year.   France currently holds the European Community's rotating presidency, and Mr. Mitterrand's visit to the Soviet Union was widely seen as a sort of Soviet-European Community summit meeting.   Mr. Gorbachev, also stressing dangers in upsetting the status quo established after World War II, said East and West should proceed from the fact that there are two independent, sovereign German states. France to 'Speak the Truth'    ''I have been asked this question many times in the last few days,'' he said. ''My position has not changed. We proceed from the assumption that each people has the right to choose, to solve its own problems of independence in its own interests, but also taking into account the interests of other countries.''   Mr. Mitterrand said France, a close ally of West Germany, should be prepared to ''speak the truth'' to Bonn over the issue of German reunification and make clear to the West German leadership the attitude of other European countries.   Mr. Mitterrand stressed that the German question should not divert the European Community from reaching agreement on an ambitious program for greater unity of its 12 members, due to be discussed at a community summit meeting in Strasbourg, France, on Friday.   ''We should not begin by talking about changing borders,'' Mr. Mitterrand said. ''Seen from the West, it is more urgent to reinforce the structure of the European Community.''   Mr. Mitterrand said he favored Mr. Gorbachev's proposal to bring forward to next year a 35-nation conference on European security.   ''President Gorbachev floated the idea,'' he said. ''I cannot speak for the other 33 countries who are not here, but as for me, I would say if this happened in 1990 it would be good.''   Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Gorbachev left Kiev late this evening. The Soviet leader returned to Moscow, while Mr. Mitterrand flew to Paris.  Party's Dominance Protested    KIEV, U.S.S.R., Dec. 6 (Reuters) - Several hundred people demanding an end to the Communist party's monopoly on power demonstrated in Kiev today as Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Mitterrand met.   In Moscow, Andrei D. Sakharov, the human rights campaigner who is a leader of the dissident bloc in the Soviet Parliament, called for a two-hour general strike next week to back demands for a debate on the issue.   The Kiev protesters, many of them members of the Ukrainian mass movement Rukh, waved nationalist flags and banners demanding publication of their movement's program and an end to censorship.   The police did not try to break up the demonstration, which was held in the Ukrainian capital's central Revolution Square opposite a building where Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Mitterrand were scheduled to hold a joint news conference on their talks.

Old Fighters
LEAD: After nine years the rematch between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran was just what a fight fan should have expected: two middleweights who were nine years older, a little slower and a little richer than they were at their last encounter.

Jets' Futures Unclear

The Taxi Industry Wins Again
LEAD: In one respect, New York City's latest cab fare increase may be a blessing in disguise.
It doesn't do riders any good, but it might remind Mayor-elect David Dinkins that if he means to serve the public, he has to fight the taxi cartel.

A Year-Round Caribbean Resort

A couple of people in bathing suits were playing table tennis.
Most of the lounge chairs were filled with pink bodies yearning for a tan, and the bar was busily turning out pina coladas and rum punches.

Review/Jazz; Hopkins and Murray Plus 2
LEAD: The bassist Fred Hopkins and the cellist Deidre Murray love music's lower depths.
The quartet they assembled for a concert Wednesday at the Alternative Museum included the baritone Andy Bey and Brandon Ross on electric guitar, and their music rippled and churned in a register most groups use primarily for accompaniment.


Giants Lacking a High Gear
LEAD: They created the most memorable moments of the Giants' victory in Super Bowl XXI: Phil McConkey waving a towel to stir up the crowd, Jim Burt celebrating with his son on his shoulders, Harry Carson dumping Gatorade on Coach Bill Parcells.


WHAT'S DOING IN: Honolulu
LEAD: Honolulu is an easy place to know and love if you give it half a chance.
Some promoters call it a paradise, but it isn't.
It is a city - commercial, expensive, noisy and tacky.
It has traffic, drugs and street people.
It also has abundant natural and manmade beauty, exceptional weather, exotic foods, friendly people, low unemployment, virtually no heavy industry.

WEEDS ARE US
LEAD: As I explained to Michael Pollan, ''Time Landscape'' is not a 19th-century greenhouse encased in glass, but a landscape history interweaving with the 20th century, which illustrates the concept of co-existence rather than domination.
It is a narrative and environmental sculpture, recording the history of Greenwich Vilage, from the time prior to human intervention and continuing to the present.


Tasty Options to Costly Gifts
LEAD: SOME friends of mine have never allowed their children to buy them Christmas gifts.
All presents must be homemade.
So over the years they have received the most touching presents, many of which required hours of careful planning and hard work.
Of course, there were the inevitable misshapen pieces of pottery and the peculiar bits of knitting that came unraveled almost at once.


TALKING: Equity Loans; Shopping For the Best Deal
LEAD: SINCE the Tax Reform Act of 1986, equity loans on homes have become one of the few remaining ways to borrow a large sum of money on which interest charges are tax deductible.

A Sudden 2-Token Limit Is as Quickly Taken Back
LEAD: The Transit Authority in New York City unexpectedly imposed a two-token sales limit yesterday to curtail hoarding, but riders' anger and long lines at token booths - unusual for a Saturday - prompted officials to lift the restriction hours after it was imposed.

Pastimes; Chess
LEAD: That brilliant though eccentric theoretician Aron Nimzovich more than a half-century ago advised that the player should take a stand, espouse a cause, set himself to prove a thesis rather than look at strategy dispassionately.
There is a lot to be said for that partisan approach because it mobilizes energy and enthusiasm.


WEEDS ARE US
LEAD: In the last few years I haven't had a client who hasn't asked me to design a wildflower meadow for him, thinking it would be maintenance-free, effortlessly and constantly beautiful - and somehow morally superior because it's natural.
I've had a difficult time persuading them that without considerable maintenance they'd end up with the ''weed-filled-empty-lot'' look and that a wildflower meadow isn't at all natural in a 20-by-50-foot city backyard.

LEAD: THROUGHOUT the pinnacle and the decline of Tennessee Williams's career, ''Summer and Smoke'' wafted in the distance, a rarefied example of the playwright's incomparable style, but only occasionally revived.

A Chance to Meet Some American Composers
LEAD: A bitter irony colors many projects of new American orchestral music, casting a pall that is rarely discussed but is nonetheless palpable.

The Changing Face Of Dentistry
LEAD: In response to Dr.
Avram Goldstein's essay, ''How Government Is Changing Dentistry'' (Opinion page, Nov. 12), I was disappointed to see the attitude expressed by this practicing periodontist.

Stewart what ''Decade'' did for Neil Young and, not that he really needed it, ''Biograph'' did for Bob Dylan.
In other words, it aims to tie a diverse career together and make a serious case for its subject.

New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: It's true that we should be grateful for everything given us.
It's true, to a certain degree at least, that it's the thought that counts.
But once these truisms are out of the way, it's time to get down to the nitty-gritty.
And that is when it comes to gift-giving, there are people, lots of them, who give something they themselves would like to own.

A Prescription for Troubled I.B.M.
LEAD: By all accounts, the International Business Machines Corporation is in trouble.

Selling Out
LEAD: The farming community of Taylor, N.Y., is sharply divided over the prospect of a nuclear waste dump being located in the area: it's Arthur Allen versus everybody else.

NOT YOUR AVERAGE FAMILY
LEAD: A THIN, IMPROBABLY LOOSELY PUT TOGETHER man is standing on the stage of the Continental Divide, in New York's East Village.
He looks out at the club's dinosaur decor and its audience of second-generation bohemian children and laughs, for who knows what reason.
Then he begins to chant.
For emphasis, he picks out chords on an electric keyboard and blows short clusters of notes from a tiny pocket trumpet that once belonged to Josephine Baker's

LEAD: In the mid-1860's, officers at the United States Naval Academy were disturbed by reports of drinking and carousing by midshipmen.

Sunday Best
LEAD: Simply mention Sunday dinner in the presence of a bona fide French gastronome and his wide-eyed, sentimental expression will tell all.
With his descriptions, you can almost taste the glistening poulet doti, hear the quiet simmering of the pot-au-feu, smell the faint sweetness of a quatre-quarts aux poires warm from the oven.


Tempting the Taste for Chocolate
LEAD: THE progression is predictable.
Someone strolls down Greenwich Avenue in Greenwich and notices activity in the window of the Complete Kitchen.

Gelbart Hard-Boiled: The Case of the Alter Ego
LEAD: This is the City of Angels.
It's not my regular beat.
My name is Friedman.
I'm a country singer who writes mystery novels.
A perfectly logical choice to investigate Larry Gelbart and Cy Coleman's new Broadway musical.
So I took the case.
The story of ''City of Angels'' - which opens tomorrow at the Virginia Theater - is the story of Stine, a Chandleresque mystery novelist, and his fictional detective, Stone.


ABOUT BOOKS
LEAD: AT holiday time, it is easy to revise a line by Ford Madox Ford, proclaiming that ''only two classes of books are of universal appeal: the very best and the very worst.'' On the contrary, many a New Jersey reader will rejoice at the gift of a book from a third category: works, like those listed here, that compliment the intellect and that feature, by virtue of author or subject, a recognizable New Jersey connection.

Winning Is Old Hat

FICTION
LEAD:  REBEL WITHOUT A CLUE.
By Holly Uyemoto. (Crown, $17.95.) In this deceptive novel, adult concerns like power, fame, intimacy and mortality are tackled expertly, as is realistic dialogue laced with the macho accents of two male adolescents.

LEAD: IT WAS A SCENE SALVADORANS HAD HOPED THEY WOULD NEVER SEE again.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. I installed some insulation under the floor over my crawl space.
This insulation has a vapor barrier on one side, and so I removed the plastic vapor barrier sheets that originally covered the earth floor in the crawl space.
I would now like to cover the earth floor with something else so that I can store things there.

BACK FOR THE BRINK ONCE MORE
LEAD: In frontier days, if you believe western folklore, a man condemned to hang was set free if the rope broke.
In those days, the New York City Opera would have been a legend.


Labrador Love: Once Again, The Circle Is Unbroken
LEAD: ON a bitter February night, my husband, Bill, and I came home from our veterinarian's office, wet-eyed, holding an empty red dog collar and lead.

Reilly.


Style Makers; Tomasz Starzewski, Fashion Designer
LEAD: For the last four and a half years, Tomasz Starzewski, a 28-year-old Londoner, has designed evening wear that has been sold in stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's.
But until this fall, almost no one outside a coterie of affluent clients had heard of him.


Three Agencies With a Mission and a Focus: Home Family, and Children; The Family, Whatever Its Form, Must Survive
LEAD: As the oldest nonsectarian agency on Staten Island (in service since 1919), Staten Island Family Service Inc. has been committed to the needs of the community during the Depression, developing the War Chest during World War II, changing as the needs of the family have changed.
The preservation of the family unit has been the core element of our mandate but the structure of the family is changing.

LEAD: A Texas State Senator, Craig Washington, defeated a City Councilman today in a runoff election to choose a successor to Representative Mickey Leland, who died in a plane crash in Africa four months ago.

Teldec CD 244 191; CD only.
This is not your usual Mozart.
Mr.
Katsaris makes no attempt to imitate a fortepiano or play a ''Classic'' Mozart.
He feels the music Romantically and uses plenty of pedal (without any blurring) and large washes of color.


LOW TALES OF THE HIGHBORN
LEAD: Michael Pye misses the real point, which is that the entire content of a newspaper is virtually gossip (''Low Tales of the Highborn,'' Nov. 12).
Take, as an example, the articles about the youths accused in the attack on the Central Park jogger.
Anything beyond the fact that an attack took place and that one should attend to one's safety is gossip.


Rainbow's End: Receding Dream Of Owning a Home
LEAD: MIDWAY through our 30's, my husband and I have managed to acquire an advantage that's rare in our generation: we have a low overhead.
Each month, the mortgage we pay is a relatively small portion of our total income.


The Great Swamp: Some Other Aspects
LEAD: The recent article on the Great Swamp struck a special chord of memory from my youth.
I visited the Great Swamp several times as a teen-ager in the late 20's.
Although I lived in New York, I had an aunt and uncle who belonged to a semirural community called Chatham Colony, about a mile south of the Lackawanna Railroad, which brought us to


When the Place Names All Sound Alike
LEAD: IN Connecticut, it can sometimes be a challenge not only to get from here to there, but also even to know where there is, or when you've actually arrived there.
When I first came to live in central Connecticut in 1977, the number of localities with similar sounding names complicated my becoming familiar with the lay of the land.

Jersey Mine Cave-Ins Raise Questions of Financial Risk
LEAD: The collapse of two old copper mine shafts in backyards here on Nov. 30 has left a 75-house neighborhood nervous about possible cave-ins of 40 other shafts and raised questions about paying for future property damage and for plugging of the 279-year-old mine.


Fashion; A Fine Shirt for Bowling (Also Dancing)

Flowers for Unity


Pastimes; Coins
LEAD: Government mints around the world are making a nice profit honoring everything from the panda to sporting events.
Buried within this marketing morass are several small groups that are marketing medals as e art first and commemorative pieces second.


The Baby Bells Scramble for Europe
LEAD: The Baby Bells, long seen simply as providers of local phone service, have ambitions to go global.
Last week, U. S. West Inc. reached agreements to lay the world's longest fiber-optic cable across the Soviet Union and build a cellular phone system in Hungary, a first for Eastern Europe.
A consortium including the Pacific Telesis Group won a multibillion dollar contract for the first private cellular system in West Germany, beating out bids from five other regional


Suit Seeks Drug Treatment for Pregnant Women
LEAD: Three hospitals and a drug-treatment center in New York City have been sued for refusing to provide drug and alcohol treatment to pregnant women.
The case, brought by the Women's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union in a class-action suit, is thought to be the first in the nation to challenge exclusion of pregnant women from drug programs, a widespread practice.


'Field to Factory' Explores Migration at Hudson Museum
LEAD: A PHOTOGRAPH of a tree is included in the Hudson River Museum of Westchester's current exhibition here: ''Field to Factory: Afro-American Migration 1915-1940.'' The picture seems quite ordinary until one reads the caption: ''Hanging Tree, New Madrid, Missouri.''


Seat Strategy

LEAD: Constantine XII, King of the Hellenes until the military junta he tried to overthrow abolished the monarchy in June 1973, said in a rare interview in exile here that he would like to go back to Greece.

Their voyages have left a legacy of Portuguese language and culture in romantic places like Macao, Goa, Mozambique and Farmingville.


Finally, a Hot High-Tech Offering
LEAD: In a slack market for initial public offerings in technology, many analysts are toasting this month's coming debut of MIPS Computer Systems Inc.
Investors might find that it is best to join the party now, buying during the offering but maybe selling before others take a sober look at MIPS's long-term prospects.


Reviews/Music; Opera Students in Stravinsky's 'Rake's Progress'
LEAD: Igor Stravinsky's opera ''The Rake's Progress'' (1951) is a monument to artifice.
Determinedly awash in what the composer called ''the early cliches I have tried to re-establish,'' the libretto of W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman echoes almost every device of 18th-century opera, and the score revels in the results of Stravinsky's three-year immersion in Mozart's ''Cosi Fan Tutte.


Philippine Rebel Holdouts Finally Yield
LEAD: Eight days after a widespread revolt broke out within its military, the Philippine Government regained control today over a strategic southern air base and finally put an end to the rebellion that nearly brought down President Corazon C. Aquino.

O'Rourke's proposed record spending plan.


HEY DUDE, LIKE NEH - OH WAY!
LEAD: I enjoyed Patrick Cooke's article on changing American dialects (''Are Accents Out? Hey Dude, Like NEH-oh Way!'' Nov. 19).
It brought back fond memories of my childhood summers on a beach in southern Maine.
The perfect icebreaker for renewing old friendships and making new ones was to acknowledge - and often poke fun at - one another's regional accents.


CRUMBS IN THE COVERS
LEAD: Your article about eating in bed evoked the most pleasant of childhood memories.


POSTINGS: In the Adirondacks; Inn Out, Condos In
LEAD: The Rocky Point Inn, a well-known resort that had operated in the central Adirondacks for almost a century, has been torn down and its 26-acre site is being redeveloped into a vacation condominium complex called Rocky Point.

Chicken Delight
LEAD: THIS is a good recipe to make when your wife is out of town or consulting a nationally prominent divorce attorney.
I call it ''Boiled Chicken Thighs Jimmy.''


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  THE TURBAN FOR THE CROWN: The Islamic Revolution in Iran, by Said Amir Arjomand. (Oxford University, $9.95.) A sociologist specializing in Islam tries to explain the mystifying Iranian revolution, in which people rose up to demand less freedom and fewer material things.
Last year our reviewer, Robin Wright, called this ''a thought-provoking work and a major contribution to serious scholarship on Iran, modern revolutions and the role of religion in contemporary politics.


Dubuffet and Bultman in Storrs
LEAD: JEAN DUBUFFET (1901-1985) and Fritz Bultman (1919-1985) are not exactly peas in a pod, one being a Frenchman who valued nature - unspoiled human nature, that is - above culture, the other an American ''committed to conquering nature.'' Nevertheless, shows by the artists are running side by side at the Benton Museum of the University of Connecticut in


Davin Schoenberger, Rabbi, 92
LEAD: Rabbi Davin Schoenberger, who performed the marriage of Anne Frank's parents and later fled Nazi Germany, died Tuesday at University Hospital.

Edward J. Kaplan, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Harold L. Kaplan of Beacon, N.Y.
Rabbis Erwin Zimet and Charles M. Feinberg performed the ceremony.

West Bank and Taxes
LEAD: To the Editor:


What's That I Hear? Far Too Much
LEAD: SOMETIME between its headline-snaring decisions about flag burning and about abortion limits, the United States Supreme Court handed down a decision affirming the right of New York City to limit the volume of rock concerts in Central Park's open-air bandshell.
With luck, the precedent will ripple out to communities everywhere, eventually reducing some of the torment imposed on captive audiences by mega-decibel noise.


Question of the Week; Should the Knicks Play Strickland, Jackson, Or Both?
LEAD: Even though Jackson seems to be playing like he's in a funk, he has the capability and will be showing it again soon enough.
Strickland is playing great, but that may be because he doesn't have the pressure of starting or, at this time, the pressure of not getting enough minutes.
Together, they complement and supplement each other's strengths and weaknesses.


CRUMBS IN THE COVERS
LEAD: I was surprised to read that Wolfgang Puck said he does not like to eat in bed (Food: ''Crumbs in the Covers,'' by Linda Wells, Nov. 12).
When Wolf and his wife, Barbara, visited us for a few days, I took a picture of them eating a breakfast in bed of hot chocolate souffle with whipped cream and raspberries.


After Music Videos, All the World Has Become a Screen
LEAD: MTV probably didn't know its own strength when the cable channel started broadcasting music video clips day and night on Aug. 1, 1981.
But as the end of the decade draws near, the fast pace and kaleidoscopic style of music video has ricocheted across popular culture, changing the way people listen to music and leaving its frenetic mark on movies, television, fashion, advertising and even television news.

By Rosalind Baker Wilson.

New York:  Grove Weidenfeld. $18.95.


PRODUCTIVITY IS UP COMMODITIES RELIANCE, DOWN
LEAD: In the late 1970's, chemical companies operated as though demand would never decline and prices would never stop rising. ''Everyone looked at the same tea leaves, predicted shortages and built at once,'' recalled William C. Kuhlke, vice president for polymers at Dewitt &amp; Company, a Houston-based chemical industry consulting firm.


Review/Jazz; A History of the Blues, By Jimmy Witherspoon
LEAD: Jack Kleinsinger's Highlights in Jazz concerts are the last vestige of jazz as a variety show.
The format, broken up into small and large features for everybody on stage, makes them entertaining, but it rarely allows the best parts of the performance to build up speed.
Thursday night's show, featuring the singer Jimmy


Prospects; Chrysler's Big Problem
LEAD: In an effort to concentrate its resources on the North American automotive market, the Chrysler Corporation announced last week that it would sell Chrysler Technologies, which owns Gulfstream Aerospace and two military electronics companies.

LEAD: In a what appeared to be a major effort to improve the image of his Government, President Alfredo Cristiani today offered to renew peace talks with guerrillas this month and posted a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the killers of six Jesuit priests.


HEY DUDE, LIKE NEH - OH WAY!
LEAD: High school and college-age people who communicate in bisyllabic extensions do so for a number of reasons.
For one thing, people don't listen to one another as closely as they once did.
Hence, young people add syllables and redundant words and phrases to get the message across.
They pad their sentences with such expressions as ''It was, like, a great sound, ya know?


Kashmir Muslims Kidnap Indian Aide's Daughter
LEAD: Islamic militants in Kashmir say they have kidnapped the 21-year-old daughter of the Indian Cabinet minister responsible for internal security.


Stamford Makes Art A Common Endeavor
LEAD: When a disparate group of merchants, business people and professionals who work on Bedford Street in downtown Stamford was invited to select a sculpture for the public library as part of the city's Public Art Program, few of them knew much about sculpture and none of them knew any of the others.

LEAD: Bryan Dameworth, a senior from Calabasas, Calif., and Melody Fairchild, a junior from Boulder, Colo., won national titles today in the Kinney High School cross-country championships.

About Men; Where Have You Gone, Bily Boy?
LEAD: Long before I knew what ''camp'' was, Billy cracked me up with his Carmen Miranda photo collection and his swivel-hipped impersonations of our ancient sixth-grade teacher doing the watusi, a la Annette Funicello.
I have not seen Billy in 10 years, and sometimes I miss him.
He was a very funny boy.


H.U.D. Revokes Ban on Religious Displays
LEAD: The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development has revoked its ban on religious decorations in federally financed emergency shelters, and will allow a Salvation Army shelter to display a picture of Jesus, a H.U.D. official said.

John F. Raynolds 3d of Stamford, Conn., and Ascutney, Vt., and Jay C. Kuhn of Belvedere, Calif.
A May wedding is planned.


Taping Suit Perplexed By Who Was Wronged
LEAD: HALF a dozen lawyers from around the state gathered at the Attorney General's Office in Hartford last month to open the book on a series of narrow legal questions that will reverberate in Connecticut through 1990 and perhaps beyond: How many people might have had their telephone conversations improperly recorded by the state police over the last 15 years?

Soviet Party's Role Defended
LEAD: President Mikhail S. Gorbachev rebuffed growing demands for early action to end the Communist Party's monopoly on political power, warning against an ''emotional'' rush to alter the Soviet Constitution.
Page 30.


Grenada's Pungent, Versatile Nutmeg
LEAD: ONE of the oddest commodities in my mother's kitchen was an institutional-size tin of grated nutmeg that always gave me a funny feeling.
Other mothers bought their spices by the ounce.
Mine invested by the pound.
Going to Grenada finally put that tin in perspective.
As I walked through the nutmeg processing station in the coastal town of Gouyave, peering into spice-filled bins nearly the size of my bedroom and listening to literally tons of whole nutmegs rattling down chutes to be sorted, my mother's tin shrank in my memory to less than the size of a single grated speck of the spice.


Two for Tea, or Rum, or Tennis
LEAD: COMPARED with some of the orgiastic, rum-drenched singles resorts that have flourished in the Caribbean in recent years, Sandals, a couples-only club in Ocho Rios, seems like a religious seaside retreat.
That's not to say that there aren't a lot of bibulous fraternity-bash shenanigans at night, but the difference is that at Sandals the mirthmakers return to the dorm under their own power, and with their wives or steady girl friends.


Amy Cherry Wed To Pierre Abitbol
LEAD: Amy Elizabeth Cherry and Pierre N. Abitbol, associates at the law firm of Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher in New York, were married there last evening at Temple Emanu-El by Rabbi Amy B. Ehrlich.

Truman Capote Answers Robert Morse's Prayers
LEAD: Robert Morse's last Broadway appearance was in ''So Long, 174th Street,'' the 1976 musical version of ''Enter Laughing.'' The show's exit was another matter.
Not only did it close almost immediately, but the theater, the Harkness, was torn down as well.
For months afterward, as he rode the bus up and down Broadway, the actor was assaulted with the sight of his name on a ghostly marquee above the gutted theater.


More Sooner Charges
LEAD: The National Collegiate Athletic Association plans to look into comments made by a former University of Oklahoma quarterback, who told a newspaper that he used to receive favors from team boosters and his coach, Barry Switzer, and that he knew of far more serious violations he would not describe.


Japan's Loud Voice in Washington
LEAD: The Toshiba Corporation of Japan was roundly condemned by Congress two years ago for illegally selling high-technology milling equipment to the Soviet Union for use in building quieter submarine propellers.

Tasty Options to Costly Gifts
LEAD: SOME friends of mine have never allowed their children to buy them Christmas gifts.
All presents must be homemade.
So over the years they have received the most touching presents, many of which required hours of careful planning and hard work.
Of course, there were the inevitable misshapen pieces of pottery and the peculiar bits of knitting that came unraveled almost at once.


Transactions

How Cash Is Given to Politicians' Interests
LEAD: POLITICIANS and wealthy donors know that the legal limits on contributions to candidates for Federal office are all but meaningless.
But no one has dramatized that fact as well as Charles H. Keating Jr.
The unfolding case of how he encouraged five Senators to use their influence on behalf of his failing California thrift, the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, shows Mr.

Caribbean Choices, Grand and Budget
LEAD: For some travelers heading for the Caribbean islands and the Bahamas, the goal is a grand resort that in one way or another offers what is perceived to be the best: comfort, elegance, service and, for some guests at least, sports facilities that are either a few steps away or easily arranged.
For others, just being where the sea water is 75 degrees when it's snowing up north may matter more than luxury.


'Summer and Smoke' At the Yale Rep
LEAD: THROUGHOUT the pinnacle and the decline of Tennessee Williams's career, ''Summer and Smoke'' wafted in the distance, a rarefied example of the playwright's incomparable style, but only occasionally revived.

LIVING WITH AIDS
LEAD: Implicit in Eugene W. Feldman's letter concerning the ''safeness'' of safe sex is the belief that people with AIDS shouldn't have sex at all (Letters, Nov. 12, in response to ''Fighting AIDS All the Way,'' by Larry Josephs, Oct. 8).


Review/Music; Armenian Orchestra in Mini-Tour
LEAD: The Armenian Philharmonic's appearance at Carnegie Hall on Thursday night was as much an expression of need as of accomplishment.
The stated purpose of the orchestra's three-city visit to this country is to raise money for rebuilding after the vicious earthquake of exactly a year ago.
Usually the visits of such Eastern-bloc ensembles have been carefully orchestrated expressions of national pride.

LEAD: While no one in the Administration will say so, it has become clear in recent months that the longtime ''special relationship'' between the United States and Britain is being overshadowed by an increasingly demanding relationship between Washington and Bonn.


THE HIDDEN FILES
LEAD: I was appalled by the facts disclosed in your article, not only for what had been hidden so long by the Atomic Energy Commission - though some of us have long known about similar cover-ups by the A.E.C. - but for what was revealed by your author about a man who clearly made every effort to have his story and identity protected.

FOCUS: Log Homes; Kit-Built Units Gain as Prime Residences

Winter Chore: Repairing Doors
LEAD: WINTER months, when humidity levels generally are at their lowest of the year, are the best for curing problems affecting wooden interior doors.


Style Makers; Sally Safir and Richard Heimann, Bookplate Designers
LEAD: It could be that he's in the forefront of what he calls, only slightly tongue in cheek, ''a literary affectation.'' Richard Heimann certainly hopes so because he and his wife, Sally Safir, are fledgling entrepreneurs in a new business called Ex Libris (the name is from Latin words used to mean ''from the library of''), which offers a choice of 148 bookplate designs in styles as varied as Victorian and architectural, romantic and amusing.


Robinson Leads Spurs Over Nets
LEAD: The Nets were in the wrong place at the wrong time tonight.


Outdoors; Put Down That Ax and Maul
LEAD: While attacking a pile of two-foot-long white oak logs with splitting ax and maul a few days ago, I yearned for a pellet stove.
That lack of fortitude abated in less than half an hour as I warmed to my task and encountered a series of straight-grained logs that readily sundered with a single blow.


Question of the Week; Should the Knicks Play Strickland, Jackson, Or Both?
LEAD: Strickland.


When Modernism Kissed The Land of Golden Dreams
LEAD: In 1960 THE ARCHITECTURAL PHO-tographer Julius Shulman took a picture of a glass house perched high in the Hollywood Hills that will always be, for me, one of those singular images that sums up an entire city at a moment in time.
The house is sleek and white, and its glass walls are cantilevered out over the hills; two elegantly dressed women lounge inside as the lights of the vast sprawl of the Los Angeles basin twinkle below.


Holiday Concerts, Secular Recitals
LEAD: A FEW concerts this week are still bucking the holiday trend, and Real Art Ways, a Hartford-based artists cooperative that has never been one to stay on the beaten path, has scheduled a three-day New England Composers Festival that has nothing whatever to do with Christmas.


Seat Strategy
LEAD: To the Editor: K. C. Cole's ''Confessions of a Seat Strategist'' was the greatest, and yes, I do identify.
Perhaps she is a good second to S. J. Perelman in the humor department.
I chuckled and roared all week thinking of the contretemps.
STEVEN S. FEINBERG Providence, R.I.


Who's Afraid Of Superstars?
LEAD: To the Editor:

NONFICTION
LEAD:  WITNESS TO HISTORY: A Refugee from the Third Reich Remembers.
By Joachim von Elbe. (Max Kade Institute for German-American Studies/University of Wisconsin, $18.95.)

A Reluctant Education
LEAD: IT APPEARS THAT I WILL NOT HAVE A CHILD.
I AM 41 years old, and even I have to admit that the possibility, now, is remote.
Still, I cannot quite bring myself to say, ''I will not have a child.'' And so I hedge: It appears that. . . .


THE HIDDEN FILES
LEAD: I would like to express profound thanks for Clifford Honicker's article.
I am one of the survivors of Operation Crossroads.
I was on a rescue tug assigned to the salvage unit at Bikini Atoll, in the Marshall Islands.
We were back in the lagoon within hours after each of the detonations, performing a variety of damage-control operations.


PERSPECTIVE: Housing Rehabilitation; The 'Turnkey' Approach Tried in Harlem
LEAD: IT is only one small building, but the transformation in progress at a vacant and rundown five-story walk-up at 460 Convent Avenue, at the corner of 150th Street in central Harlem, has something to say about the way gut-rehabilitated housing can be produced for low-income working people and the homeless in New York


Review/Cabaret; A Songwriter Reminisces
LEAD: Philip Springer, a veteran New York songwriter who wrote the music for 1950's hits like ''How Little We Know,'' ''Moonlight Gambler'' and ''Santa Baby,'' did not reach his creative peak until a decade ago, when he collaborated with E. Y. (Yip) Harburg on the lyricist's final songs.


Sidewalk Bridges
LEAD: To the Editor:


LEARNING TO SEE BY MINIMALISM'S SLOW FIRE
LEAD: The finely tuned art of minimalism moves in incremental ways, more like the tortoise than the hare.
Changes come in terms of minor adjustments and subtle physical shifts that foment dramatic visual differences - if you know where to look.
These points were inadvertently brought home last month when Ellsworth Kelly and Peter


Campus Life: Marquette; Rugby Club Faces Punitive Action For Harassment
LEAD: Marquette University's government Senate has voted to recommend that the university disband its rugby club for one year because of its harassment of a female student.


Pastimes; Around the Garden

Boston's Black Areas Mount New Secession Drive
LEAD: The Roxbury section of Boston is a mix of red brick town houses, high-rise public housing projects and weed-covered lots.

LEAD: The Harlem end of Central Park would get a new restaurant, cafeteria and catering hall - with room for nearly 400 people - under a proposal that has been approved by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.


New Laws of Subway Life Are Met With Lawsuits
LEAD: A SUBWAY musician's folk tunes were echoing off the walls at the 72d Street IRT subway station the other day.
Was the music entertaining or distracting?
That burly fellow with the extended hand at the Brooklyn Bridge stop was just asking for help.
Or was he hinting that if he did not get a few coins there might be trouble?


Golf Attire
LEAD: To the Editor: Since 1982, my husband and I have operated a golf tour operation catering to upscale country club members whom we escort to golf clubs throughout Europe, Asia and the South Pacific.
Your Q&amp;A answer (Travel, Aug. 6) about how women should dress for a golfing trip to Scotland and Ireland in October was partially correct in saying that slacks or skirts (pleated or not) would be quite appropriate.


What Mr. Wall Should Have Known
LEAD: ''If I knew then what I know now,'' M. Danny Wall, the chief savings and loan regulator, lamented shortly before his resignation last week as director of the Office of Thrift Supervision.


Seat Strategy
LEAD: To the Editor: ''Confessions of a Seat Strategist'' by K. C. Cole (Travel, Oct. 22) was more whimpering than strategy.


Old Story
LEAD: Against the backdrop of war, a Southern belle in a plantation setting is alternately involved with a milquetoast and a rogue. ''Gone With the Wind'' or the French bestseller, ''The Blue Bicycle''?
Both of the above, said a French court last week in ruling that the 1983 novel by Regine Deforges was an ''illicit reproduction'' of the Margaret Mitchell epic published a half-century ago.


LIFE STYLE: Sunday Outing; Old Houses Decked Out For Christmas Visitors
LEAD: New York City offers a treasure of Christmases past, quiet old houses that have been dressed in their holiday best and that offer a welcome change from the rush, crush and glitter of the shopping season.

LEAD: Sean Burke, the towering goaltender, is the man the Devils expect to win more games for them than any other member of the team.
The Devils are successful when Burke plays well and suffer when he is ineffective.


Tasty Options to Costly Gifts
LEAD: SOME friends of mine have never allowed their children to buy them Christmas gifts.
All presents must be homemade.
So over the years they have received the most touching presents, many of which required hours of careful planning and hard work.
Of course, there were the inevitable misshapen pieces of pottery and the peculiar bits of knitting that came unraveled almost at once.

LEAD: The marriage of Fran Melanie Farber, the daughter of Rosalind Farber of North Woodmere, L.I., and the late Sydney Farber, to Dr.

Question of the Week; Should the Knicks Play Strickland, Jackson, Or Both?
LEAD: Whomever Stu Jackson decides to start should depend upon whom the Knicks are playing.
Jackson is unstoppable against Philadelphia, Washington, Indiana, Milwaukee, and Chicago.

Against Detroit and most of the Western teams, they should play together.

A MEXICAN RELIC IS BURIED AT LAST
LEAD: After nearly 75 years, one of the most grisly relics of the Mexican Revolution has finally been laid to rest.

Katherine Brokaw to Wed Steven Russ
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Caleb Brokaw of New Canaan, Conn., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Katherine Anne Brokaw, to Steven Russ, a son of Lieut.

THE HIDDEN FILES
LEAD: Mr.
Honicker incorrectly implies that D. Louis H. Hempelmann was associated with a cover-up.
The first scientific/medical descriptions of these radiation exposures and their sequelae were written and published by Dr.

A LESSON LEARNED FROM THE LAST DOWNTURN

Throughout the 1980's they have been shutting inefficient plants, trimming back personnel, investing in modern equipment and divesting money-losing operations.
Today, most have their fixed costs under control.


A Texas Troubadour Whose Songs Rang True
LEAD: If the backbone of traditional country and western music was the tight, almost familial, relationship between performers and fans, it's distressing how few live records manage to detail those homey bonds.
A particularly melancholy absence has been that of ErnestTubb and his Texas Troubadours, arguably country's most beloved stage act, who released only two pseudoconcert


THE HIDDEN FILES
LEAD: Clifford T. Honicker's chilling account of Louis Slotin's, S. Allan Kline's et al encounter with the Nuclear Age is as horrific as it is emblematic of the lengths to which many will go to protect the nuclear industry (in which many of the Fortune 500 are involved) and the ideology of maintaining a strong and nuclear-based national defense at any cost.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. I installed some insulation under the floor over my crawl space.

CARTER REDUX
LEAD: When Jimmy Carter returned to his home in Plains, Ga., in 1981, after losing the Presidency, he was an all-but-shattered man.
He was pilloried as the author of America's malaise and the architect of its economic stagnation, and humiliated as the remaining 52 American hostages in Iran were released the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office - after Carter's own rescue effort had died ignominiously in a remote desert in Iran.

LEAD: INCORPORATED in 1670 on the same 39.6 square miles of the Quinnipiac River Valley that it occupies today, Wallingford is one of Connecticut's oldest towns and one of the most stable.

I am preparing for my first open-water dive, hung about with hoses, mask and snorkel, bent double from the weight of the cylinder of compressed air on my back.

Comaneci Hailed and Jeered in Florida

Restaurants

Ruiz's Surrealistic 'Pirates'
Raul Ruiz's ''City of Pirates'' was shown as part of the 1985 New York Film Festival.
Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 6, 1985.
The film (in French with English subtitles) opens today with Mr.
Ruiz's ''Three Sad Tigers'' at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street.
The Chilean-born fabulist Raul Ruiz makes surrealist films that are entirely self-contained; for ''intriguingly enigmatic,'' as the New York Film Festival literature describes Mr.
Ruiz's ''City of Pirates,'' you might just as well read impenetrable.
However, this film, like Mr.
Ruiz's ''Three Crowns of the Sailor'' (which was shown at the 1984 festival), has the strong imagery and confident, if solipsistic, visual style that make Mr.
Ruiz's work notable.

Places for AIDS Patients Are Still Scarce

Pricier Products for a More Extravagant Buyer

Is the Run On the Hits An Error?
LEAD: Are renters finding what they want when they go to the video store?
In this the year of big-movie cassettes for sale (''Batman'' et al.), some in the trade are concerned that rentals, still the real right arm of video with about 70 percent of the revenue, aren't getting enough attention.

There Are Benefits In Homeschooling
LEAD: Not long ago, the Long Island Weekly published an article I wrote about homeschooling my 8-year-old son.
I had expected some reader criticism, but I was completely unprepared for the ferocity of the negative responses.

A Deceptive Exterior in North Bellmore
LEAD: CONTRAST and contradiction characterize North Bellmore's Smithville Cafe.

FICTION
LEAD:  BEAUTIFUL MUTANTS.
By Deborah Levy. (Viking, $17.95.) Although billed as a novel, Deborah Levy's rather thin little book, ''Beautiful Mutants,'' reads more like a short story.

Women and the Respect They Deserve
LEAD: I felt an all too familiar rumbling in the pit of my working-mommy belly as I read Janet Gibbs-Albanesius's article, ''That Old Question for a Candidate'' (Opinion page, Oct. 29).

MENCKEN'S DIARIES: SUSTAINED BY SCORN AND BEER
LEAD: H.L.

The great journalist, critic and editor was 50 years old, just married for the first time and, as Charles A. Fecher, the editor of the diary, tells us, deeply, romantically in love with his wife, Sara.
It's ironic that Mencken began his diary in the first year of a new decade.

'Mistress of the Inn;' 1751 Farce, in Fairfield
LEAD: DO not dismiss the Boston Post Road Stage Company on the evidence of the current cheerless production of ''The Mistress of the Inn.'' The dauntless little professional theater in Fairfield has considerable virtues but playing classic comedy is just not one of them.


Loyalty in Albany: Official's Downfall?

He won.

A February wedding is planned.


Chatter, Chirps, Cackles - On With the Dance
LEAD: Dancegoers never know what they'll hear next at a performance.

Museums Without Tears
LEAD: DURING the last two years, a fortuitous combination of personal and professional circumstances has enabled me to spend considerable time in three of the world's great museums - the Louvre, the Hermitage and the Uffizi.
Upon returning from these journeys to Paris, Leningrad and Florence, I sensed a certain loss of interest on the part of my hometown audience when I began talking about daily, near-idyllic forays into the halls of art.

Arms Makers Gird for Peace
LEAD: WAR is a dirty business.
But for makers of guns, tanks and planes, it is a profitable one.


Pastimes; Bridge
LEAD: Sneaky and improper dumping is a source of controversy and outrage for bridge players as well as for environmentalists and urban planners.
Can it ever be proper to play badly by intention, dumping points to opponents who have not earned them and damaging other players in the process?
It is easy to answer this question with a flat negative, and many, but not all, authorities do so.

By Yoshinobu Ashihara.
Translated by Lynne E. Riggs. (Kodansha International, $17.95).

Christmas For the Thrifty: Yes, in Paris
LEAD: PARIS is one of the cheapest places I know to have a glorious Christmas - or rather have a glorious time escaping from Christmas.
Not a total escape; for that you'd have to go to Lhasa or Teheran.
But if this year you can't face another magazine-ad-type American family Christmas with the father in Santa Claus costume and everybody sitting happily around the tree amid mountains of gaily wrapped laptop computers, Cabbage Patch dolls and electric trains, while through the snowy window can be seen the front end of the new car ''we gave to each other,'' Paris makes a blissful change.

LEAD: A gang of 10 armed robbers invaded an apartment-house garage on the Upper West Side early yesterday, held up the attendant and made off with five late-model cars, the police said.
The last car was cut off by police officers arriving at the garage and one of the occupants was seized.


Campus Life: University of Connecticut; Converting Excess Dining Credits to Help Charities
LEAD: It was a combination of charity and protest as 150 University of Connecticut students waited in line last weekend at Jonathan's, one of three fast-food restaurants here on the campus.
The students were using the balance on their Vali-Dine cards to help feed the needy and homeless in nearby Willimantic.


U.S. Train, Champagne Class
LEAD: FOR many Americans notions about long-distance train travel have more to do with mythology than memory.
While few of us really knew the Santa Fe Super Chief or ever rode the 20th Century Limited, the mere whisper of such names evokes excitement and romance, in the same way we are still stirred by the sound of a faraway locomotive whistle.


New York G.O.P. Is Better Organized But Still Seeks Challenger to Cuomo
LEAD: As it prepares for a critical gubernatorial election, the New York State Republican Party is better financed and better staffed than it has been since the Rockefeller era.
But it still lacks an experienced and well-known candidate to challenge Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo if he seeks a third term and to end a 16-year Republican absence from the

Magic Johnson Turns Back the Nets
LEAD: Whenever the Los Angeles Lakers visit, there is excitement in the air, a large crowd is in the stands, and the opposing team's level of play usually rises.


Maurice Stans's Offer Rejected by His Town
LEAD: An offer by Maurice Stans to donate his family home and a new museum to his hometown has been rejected because officials do not want to be responsible for the upkeep.


Platinum Prints, Canvases of Color
LEAD: THE Yale Center for British Art has never seemed more British than it does now, with ''The Desired Haven,'' a group of 89 photographs by Frederick H. Evans (1853-1943).


Battles Won, Memories Lost
LEAD: DID an American Army sergeant kill more than 500 Japanese soldiers singlehandedly in one battle during World War II?
Was he denied the Medal of Honor because he is Jewish?


A Bill of Rights for the Disabled Nears Passage
LEAD: LEGISLATION designed to provide equal treatment and broad changes for disabled people in the United States, estimated to number at least 43 million, is expected to be enacted early next year.


Two Musicals We Needed Have Checked In
LEAD: I think we can tell ourselves that it's going to be all right now.


Church Seeks to Raise the Human to the Divine; Who Is the Church?
LEAD: To the Editor:


The Taxpayers' Campaign Chest
LEAD: THE New York City Campaign Finance Board is the rare government agency that didn't spend its budget.
Taxpayers may exult at the budgetary success the brand-new office had in substituting taxpayers' money for big special-interest contributions in this year's city political campaigns - the first large municipal experiment of its kind in the country.


From Carols to Handbells, for Younger Listeners
LEAD: THE cultural needs of children are not being forgotten this holiday season, with more than a dozen attractions designed for younger listeners - and in some cases featuring them.


Church Battle
LEAD: To the Editor:

Hanoi Protests Over Boat People

Sudan Hardens Crackdown on Internal Opponents
LEAD: The junta that squashed a democratically elected government in the Sudan nearly six months ago is toughening its stand against its opponents by imposing death sentences, bombing southern towns in an intensified civil war and saying that it plans to carry out a strict Islamic code.


THE MEKONS TAKE AIM AT ROCK-AND-ROLL
LEAD: ''Hey - rock-and-roll!'' Sally Timms shouted as she and her fellow Mekons crammed themselves back onstage for encores at the Knitting Factory a few weeks ago.
For most bands, the phrase is simply a sure-fire way to draw a yell from an audience.
But for the Mekons, it is anything but unexamined; when they say rock-and-roll, they're simultaneously loving, wistful, suspicious, defiant and gleeful.


More Housing For a Railyard
LEAD: AFTER a 12-year hiatus, residential construction has resumed at a 52-acre former railroad yard on this city's near South Side.


Who Was The Athlete of The Decade?

LEAD: President Bush said today that he had ''no second thoughts at all'' about sending envoys to China last week.
But he added that he did not believe that it was time for the United States or other countries to remove sanctions against China, imposed after the killings of students protesting for democracy in


PITCHING DOCTORS
LEAD: The materials that detail men disseminate are not bad or wrong or poorly presented (''Pitching Doctors,'' by Michael S. Wilkes and Miriam Shuchman, Nov. 5).
Rather, they are so professional, so slickly done, that it is hard to remember they are not necessarily the broad scholarly surveys that ought to form the basis for wise prescribing.


Review/Music; The Selah Vocal Ensemble
LEAD: The Selah Vocal Ensemble, a choir that specializes in Jewish sacred and secular music of all eras, turned its sights on sacred works by the late-Renaissance composer Salamone Rossi in a concert last Sunday afternoon at the Jewish Museum.


English Christmas
LEAD: To the Editor: We found ourselves in the same situation as the person who wrote (Q &amp; A, Travel, Oct. 8) about what to do in London during the Christmas holiday.


Collecting Crystal for Pleasure and for Profit
LEAD: In a bid for a share of the upper tier of the crystal market, more and more manufacturers are forming collectors' clubs.
Membership buys certain privileges - for instance, the ability to purchase exclusive pieces.
But the real intention of these marketing ploys is to lock in collectors to a given brand, thereby increasing the sales of both retailers and manufacturers, which market the clubs together.

Campus Life: Maryland; A Housing Bill Angers Students And Landlords
LEAD: When Councilman James T. Herl of Prince George's County attended the University of Maryland, he fought for students' rights against landlords who he said were more concerned about profit margins than respectable and affordable housing.


Travel Myths
LEAD: To the Editor: For 35 years I have been hustling around the globe and been the director of summer schools abroad.
I am thus accustomed to the risks and thrills both of solo and group wandering.
The following strike me as the four dominant myths about travel:


Veteran Denied a Medal Sadly Vows to Fight On
LEAD: David Rubitsky, his hands trembling slightly as he read from a handwritten statement on lined notebook paper, today rebutted the Army's finding that he was simply an honorable old soldier with a foggy memory.


Pastimes; Around the Garden
LEAD: For This Week: Carry on with the holiday projects such as shopping, decorating, wrapping, mailing, baking, etc, but do not neglect house plants that will need watering, debugging and leaf cleaning with a damp paper towel.
Hold back on the use of fertilizer at this time of year as most indoor plants are in a dormant-rest period.


Who Was The Athlete of The Decade?
LEAD: The American diver Greg Louganis.
Since 1976, he has won four Olympic gold medals, 47 American titles, and 120 of 153 major events.
Beyond that, in this decade of million-dollar earnings and cocaine and steroid abuse scandals, Louganis exemplifies the true spirit of competition and the beauty of sport.


Local Hero
LEAD: ALL-AMERICA football players do not develop often on the Brookville, L.I., campus of C. W. Post.
But there was one this season.
John Lavelis, a senior defensive end, was named to the all-America first team for Division III chosen for Kodak by the American Football Coaches Association.
Lavelis and Paul Cioffi, a defensive end from Montclair


Style Makers; Konstantine Kakanias, Illustrator
LEAD: If Konstantine Kakanias had his way, most of the things that surround him in the world would be painted - and he would quickly volunteer for the job.
The 28-year-old artist, who was born in Athens, lives in New York and is well on his way to putting his imprimatur on scenic backdrops for shop windows, glossy magazine pages and table tops.


A BROTHER'S DEATH
LEAD: My brother's name was Doug, the partner he left behind is Skip (Hers: ''A Brother's Death,'' by Barbara Lazear Ascher, Nov. 19).
Doug's ashes rest in the sea off the coast of Maine, and he has been gone two years.
In every other respect (that he was 31 when he died of AIDS, that he was the brother of two sisters and that his parents were unashamed of the cause of his death) the circumstances of Doug and Bobby are the same.


Arnold Moss, 80, Popular Actor Famous for Shakespearean Roles
LEAD: Arnold Moss, the popular classical actor, died of lung cancer Friday at his home in Manhattan.

Knicks Win 9th in a Row at Home
LEAD: The Knicks last night won their ninth successive home-court game since the beginning of the season, a franchise record for the fastest start.
The 118-97 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics came so easily that it was enough to lull the Madison Square Garden capacity crowd of 18,212 to sleep.


Evening Hours; The Faces May Be Familiar, but Not the Places
LEAD: There was a time when one could take a census of the rich and social in New York by poking a head into certain hotel ballrooms during the charity season and counting the hundreds of notable noses.
If they weren't at the Waldorf, they were at the Plaza or the Pierre.
Some nights they were at all three.


Nursing Enrollments End 5 Years of Declines
LEAD: The number of new students enrolling in college and university nursing programs increased for the first time in five years, but the increase is too small to overcome an acute nursing shortage, a new survey shows.


Style Makers; Leslie Hope Derene, Photographer
LEAD: Leslie Hope Derene studied historic preservation at Boston University and spent eight years working in the fashion industry before finding her true calling.
She now takes photographs and mounts them on gift and note cards, holiday ornaments and portfolios.

And at times the goal is to alter the style of new residential construction.

Beyond Expectations
LEAD: MY CULINARY CHAUVINISM DISAPPEARED WHEN I got my first chance to eat in England.
Along with a whole bag of heavy sweaters for that mid-June jaunt, I had secretly packed a jar of pickled jalapeno peppers for my trip.
If British food was truly going to be as dismal as I had always heard, I wanted to be able to give it a little heat, if not life.


NONFICTION
LEAD:  LILY POND: Four Years With a Family of Beavers.
By Hope Ryden. (Morrow, $17.95.) It is likely that ''Lily Pond'' will appeal to nature lovers.
The startling thing, though, is how well Hope Ryden's study of a beaver family succeeds on other levels.
Her observations of a pair of wild beavers in New York's Harriman State Park is eloquent and suspenseful, educational without being didactic, and includes a reasoned analysis of whether humans should further disrupt nature's balance.

Girls Should Quit Smoking - It's a Breeze
LEAD: FANS!
They're the solution.
Not screaming, frenzied rock-star fans, not electric fans, but hand-held semicircles of ribbed paper, lace and silk.
Fans held delicately in front of one's face, calling attention to flirtatious eyes.
Fans snapping shut for emphasis.
Fans gracefully fluttered to advertise allure.

George R. Minot of Santa Barbara, Calif., and North Haven, Me., have made known the engagement of Mr.

JEROME AGEL  New York


Texas Justice
LEAD: Texas has put 33 people to death since it resumed executions in December 1982.
Clarence Lee Brandley twice came within days of being a 34th - even though the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals now says that his 1981 conviction for rape and murder was a ''subversion of justice.''


Pastimes; Coins
LEAD: The wealth of the Americas flowed to Spain in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.
Each year, if wars permitted, two fleets would cruise the Caribbean, depositing Spanish trade goods and picking up gold doubloons, silver pesos, emeralds and pearls.
Goods from the Orient, brought by the Manila fleet to Acapulco and by mule across Mexico to Vera Cruz, were loaded aboard.


Taking the Squeak Out of Stairs
LEAD: SQUEAKY stairs are a comfort to some homeowners.
Familiar noises on the stairs signal the return of family members, while unfamiliar noises may warn of an intruder.


Earning It
LEAD: Some have always been more equal than others in Marxist Europe.
But with the new freedom in the East has come a tide of old resentments of the privileges accorded party officials and top athletes, among others.
Katarina Witt, the Olympic figure-skating champion, thinks some of her complaining East German countrymen are being a bit ungrateful.


To Repair Our Nation
LEAD: The need for large-scale investment in public works is obvious to anyone who travels about the United States.
And there is a way to make it possible despite the Federal Government's budget deficit: the creation of state infrastructure banks.


Amy Weber Engaged To Marry David Stern
LEAD: A January wedding is planned by Amy Sue Weber and David Lawrence Stern, the future bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs.

Gifts, From Wipers to a Rolls
LEAD: IF that Christmas stocking feels a bit thin and spindly this year, it may be because the world's largest supplier of windshield wipers has had its way with Santa.


STREETSCAPES: The View Down Fifth Avenue; Tower Now Blocks the Prospect
LEAD: IT was the most evanescent of unofficial landmarks, a haphazard alignment of buildings spanning half a century along a mile-long stretch of Fifth Avenue.
The view south toward the Empire State Building - actually a gradually rising succession of buildings - was long familiar to tourists and New Yorkers walking down the avenue along Central Park from as far north as the Cooper-Hewitt Museum at 91st


FICTION
LEAD:  RUNNING WILD.
By J. G. Ballard. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $12.95.) Over the last 25 years, the British writer J. G. Ballard has touched a great many stylistic bases, ranging from straight science fiction (''The Drowned World'') to abrasive experimentalism (''Crash'') to autobiographical realism (''Empire of the Sun'').


THREE WHO HAD MUCHTO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER
LEAD: One of the works of art now on the market that this critic would most like to find in his Christmas stocking is the painting after Veronese by Eugene Delacroix that is now on view at the Salander-O'Reilly Gallery, 20 East 79th Street.
The subject is a detail - two bearded heads - from the great ''Marriage at Cana'' by Veronese in the

Church Seeks to Raise the Human to the Divine; Central Bobist Temple
LEAD: To the Editor:


Under the Microscope At County's New Lab
LEAD: WHEN a suspect is arrested in a drug case in Westchester, the police have five days to analyze the drugs seized or the suspect must be released and the charges dropped.
Last year, drugs from 3,530 cases were sent to the crime lab and 88,705 tests were performed on the drugs.
This year's cases are expected to total 3,800.


A Small Flotilla of Unanchored Anchors
LEAD: Some months ago, NBC ran a full-page advertisement that asked if it mattered whether the anchor of a nightly news program was this fellow or that.
The ad's unastonishing answer was that it mattered a lot and that NBC's own man Tom Brokaw was the anchor of choice.
Unfortunately for NBC, that does not seem to be the opinion of most viewers.


Mexico's Colonial Heart
LEAD: IN many ways, the geographic heart of Mexico is also its spiritual and cultural heart.
Dotted with elegant colonial cities and villages that still hew to traditional folkways and crafts, the area extending in an arc west and north of the capital is rich both in character and history.
And unlike the Yucatan or the resorts of the Pacific Coast, the states of Michoacan, Guanajuato and Queretaro are readily accessible from Mexico


Sex, Art and Censorship on the Drawing Board
LEAD: The first reaction is shock.
The rather comfortable, familiar proscenium space at Manhattan Theater Club's Stage One has been temporarily transformed into a theater in the round.
To get to its seats, the audience must tiptoe through clumps of straw while instinctively trying to avoid fake pieces of manure.


Nearing the End Of a Bad Year For Traveling

LEAD: A Federal appeals judge was killed and his wife was seriously injured this afternoon by a mail bomb that went off at their home in this Birmingham suburb, the authorities said.


Review/Music; Richard Goode's Pianism
LEAD: What makes Richard Goode such a splendid chamber-music pianist, I think, is not an anonymous personality, but - to the contrary - the restrictions on his own personal passions imposed by those around him.


THE DAZZLE OF GLASS, SEEN OVER TIME
LEAD: Every technique used to make glass over 3,500 years is represented in ''The Art of Glass: Masterpieces From the Corning Museum,'' an exhibition on view at the I.B.M.
Gallery of Science and Art, Madison Avenue at 56th Street.
The 116 molded, blown, cut, engraved or painted works in these dazzling displays were made during the peak periods of this craft, from ancient Egypt onward, and include some of the finest examples extant.


Review/Music; Dennis Russell Davies in Brooklyn
LEAD: On Wednesday, Dennis Russell Davies was named music director of the Brooklyn Academy of Music and principal conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, both effective in 1991.
On Friday evening, he conducted the first in a three-concert series with the Philharmonic at the academy - the final installment is this afternoon at 2 - and a better advertisement for himself could hardly be imagined.


Give Families a Choice of Schools
LEAD: SIX years after studies first warned that mediocre schools make America a nation at risk, the need to improve schools is so dire that it drew some of the country's top leaders to a nationwide summit just a few weeks ago.

LEAD: The inauguration of a new president at Wabash College this month has given rise to renewed speculation that this all-men's liberal arts college - one of two of its kind in the nation - might some day join the ranks of coeducation.


AMERICA'S RADIATION VICTIMS
LEAD: The following is from a letter my father wrote to me in 1981: ''In 1956, I went to Nevada to a field test of an atomic shot.
It was a 28-kiloton shot and we were in the trenches at three miles from ground zero. . . .
The ground rolled like the waves in the ocean, and the flash was so bright that, with my eyes closed and with my head cradled in my arm and my arm resting on my leg, I could see every bone in my arm and legs like you see in an X-ray picture.


Legislators Nearing Deadline on Budget
LEAD: COUNTY legislators grappling with a proposed $1 billion budget for 1990, Westchester's largest, face what may be a large and hostile crowd tomorrow night at the Board of Legislator's last public hearing.

Those likely to fill the lawmaker's eighth-floor chamber at 7:30 P.M.

POSTINGS: The Metropolitan Club; Facade Mudpack
LEAD: The Metropolitan Club, which moved into its building at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and East 60th Street 95 years ago, is cleaning the exterior of the landmarked property, which was designed by Stanford White.
More than $1 million is being spent to dissolve as many as five layers of paint on the marble exterior, and then slather it with a chemical poultice to remove stains caused by the reaction between air pollutants and impurities in the stone.


Nina Reetz Wed To G. P. Richter
LEAD: Nina Katherine Reetz and Gregory Peter Richter were married yesterday by the Rev.
Dr.
P.

STOCKING STUFFERS? TRY ACCISSORIES

They are easy to shop for - even at the last minute.
To find something in a hurry in a hi-fi shop to please music-minded friends, just check out all those little gadgets known collectively as audio accessories.


Like the Toy? See the Movie.
LEAD: You ordered the burger, the fries and the Coke, but you certainly didn't order the Flounder.
There he is anyway: a three-inch blue-and-yellow rubber replica of a character from ''The Little Mermaid'' right there in your McDonald's Happy Meal, in a box adorned with jokes and puzzles that test your knowledge of Little Mermaid lore.


A Bittersweet Pilgrimage
LEAD: THE cobblestone streets of the medieval German city of Freiburg, near the French border in a valley protected by the lush slopes of the Black Forest, are lined by narrow canals filled with fresh, running water.
They were built, some say, in an effort to help keep the streets cool in hot weather.


Review/Dance; Three Suites and a Solo In the Ailey Tradition
LEAD: Alvin Ailey was a master of the choreographic suite.
That was made clear when the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater presented two of his finest works in the suite form last Sunday night at the City Center Theater as part of the company's series of programs called In the Black Tradition.

A LUXURY FIGHT TO THE FINISH
LEAD: BERNARD ARNAULT, THE 40-YEAR-OLD CHAIRMAN of LVMH, which combines some of France's oldest, most pretigious names, no longer has to apologize for the way his new Paris office looks.
Arnault, a short, trim, somewhat awkward man, spent his first 10 months here with mud brown walls and a simple wooden desk - a far cry from the crystal chandeliers he left behind at the Christian Dior fashion house.


Pop Operetta Set in a Diner on Christmas
LEAD: BY now, theatergoers who favor traditional holiday fare may have had their seasonal share of the Scrooge saga.

Dennis Quaid: Sometimes He's So Easy to Love
LEAD: One of those sticky questions that cling to Hollywood actors is why the undeniably popular Dennis Quaid - whose screen presence seems an unbeatable mix of boyish grin, effortless sex appeal and sudden bursts of passion - has never starred in a blockbuster movie.
GREAT BALLS OF FIRE (1989, Orion, $89.98), appearing on video little more than five months after it bombed in theaters, won't do much to clear up the box-office mystery.


The Winning Ways to Desegregate The Schools
LEAD: THIS fall, Seattle voters narrowly approved, in a nonbinding referendum, a measure asking the school board to stop busing students for racial balance.

New York's Christmas House

LEAD: Remember sweet-and-sour pork?
It is one of the first dishes most people over 40 ate at a Chinese restaurant.
It was always a Cantonese restaurant; 40 years ago, Szechuan had yet to reach the United States.
Actually, the dish was mainly sweet; the vast quantities of sugar and the canned pineapple in heavy syrup disguised whatever sour ingredients had been added.


Lifestyle; Little Pigs On Move From Sty To Parlor
LEAD: Llamas and boas, ferrets and parrots have led the exotic pet parade in years past.

A BROTHER'S DEATH
LEAD: It seems almost obscene to infringe on the emotional display of Ms.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Margeotes Maintains An Allure CREATIVE people are a fickle lot, always seeking the next set of hot agencies and sending out their collected oeuvre of ads, hoping for a look-see, an interview and maybe a job. These days, the resumes of creative people seem to be arriving with great frequency at Margeotes Fertitta &amp; Weiss.   The artistry of its print advertising for clients like Remy Martin liqueurs, Godiva chocolates and Harper's Bazaar magazine certainly tends to lure wandering creative souls. The agency's art directors seem to sculpture images on pages using light and shadow as tools.   But even more attractive is that Margeotes seems to be a tranquil island in a sea of agency mergers, client defections and executive resignations. This despite the loss earlier in the year of Oldsmobile's Tri-State Marketing Group - the ''Good Olds Guys'' - after a tenure of barely six months.   ''We hardly ever lose business,'' said the agency's co-founder, president and chief executive, George A. Fertitta. ''Godiva has been with us for 12 years; Remy Martin, seven years; Bankers Trust, six years; Orrefors crystal has been here six years.''   But the greatest appeal may lie simply in that ineluctable thing called culture. The agency, just down the block from the Public Theater and next door to the Cheyenne Social Club in downtown Manhattan, is a happy place, and Mr. Fertitta is a buoyant man.   He says he has never felt constrained by the way agencies do things because, when he formed the agency in 1973 with John Margeotes, who is now retired, he had worked in advertising only six months. (The name of John Weiss was added when he joined the agency several months later.) While Mr. Fertitta was building the agency to about $80 million in billings, he insisted that one of its three rules for employment be that ''people love themselves.'' Inside his agency, he added, ''there's a lot of laughter - a lot of crying.''   While one could easily dismiss Mr. Fertitta's touchy/feely commentary as New Age hokum, he is too ingenuous to disbelieve. The staff banter and informal tone of the agency reinforce what he says: A stairwell is decorated with a painting executed by a local grafitti artist; staff members have access to a small ''reading room'' where magazines are strewn on blue-and-white canvas beach chairs and starch-white wooden tables topped by umbrellas.   With his shaggy brown hair, smooth complexion and voice that erupts frequently into boyish shouts, Mr. Fertitta not only looks younger than his 43 years, but he seems barely older than the twentysomethings who populate his agency.   ''She just had a baby and came back,'' he said, pointing to one employee. He stopped by an office where two women were chating: ''And she just had a baby,'' he said, glancing at one while the the other shot him a funny smile. ''Not you,'' he shouted. ''If you're pregnant, I'll kill you! You told me you wouldn't do that for two years!'' He laughed. She laughed.   That kind of chemistry has created an effective compound. The agency says it has grown about 30 percent a year for the last several years. Judy Wald, a leading ad agency creative recruiter, lists Margeotes with Korey, Kay &amp; Partners, Goldsmith/ Jeffrey, Angotti, Thomas, Hedge and Berenter Greenhouse &amp; Webster as the hot creative shops currently.   Alice Magdol-Conrad, another advertising executive recruiter, said Margeotes has ''proven they can compete in the mainstream with major agencies.'' Its success, she said, stems from its ability to attract business from major companies, including a confidential assignment from the General Foods Corporation.   ''That differentiates it from other small shops that may get pieces of business from small companies,'' Ms. Magdol-Conrad said. Because of its success in luring widely known clients, she said, and because, unlike many creative boutiques, it has demonstrated prowess in television as well as print advertising, ''it is a shop that can attract people who are not normally attractable to small agencies.''   Indeed, the media director of Margeotes, Susan Nanfeldt, came from Ogilvy &amp; Mather; the director of account services, Don Maurer, was at BBDO, and the co-creative director, Jeff Weiss, worked six years at J. Walter Thompson.   Mr. Fertitta has a term for what drew them: ''Naive freshness,'' he called it. ''It works in our favor.''

Spurt in Travel Abroad Cuts Japan's Large Trade Surplus After fruitless years of struggling with Japan to negotiate down its yawning trade surpluses, foreign governments are getting help from an unlikely source: 10 million Japanese with a passion for overseas travel.   With all those yen and dollars being spent offshore as Japanese ''import'' hotel lodging, restaurant meals and myriad other travel services, Japan's financial surpluses are shrinking quickly, even while many thorny trade issues remain unresolved.   ''To our surprise, travel services have become Japan's second-largest 'import,' after oil,'' said Koji Watanabe, the deputy minister for foreign affairs and a top official representing Japan in current trade negotiations with the United States. Travel, Mr. Watanabe added, represents ''one of the most promising areas for Japan to increase its imports.'' A Large Travel Deficit    In the first nine months of this year, Japan ran a $14.5 billion travel deficit, meaning that is how much more Japanese travelers spent overseas than foreign travelers spent in Japan. With a year-end surge beginning - travel agents estimate that a half-million Japanese will go abroad for the holidays - the Government expects the deficit to top $20 billion for the year. That would more than double the $8.7 billion travel deficit in 1987 and would represent a fivefold increase from the $3.7 billion gap in 1985.   The total of 10 million overseas travelers includes both tourists and people on business trips and is nearly double the level of three years ago. Some experts maintain that the figures would be much higher were it not for serious bottlenecks at Japan's undersized, overburdened international airports, which can make overseas travel an ordeal.   ''Not only are people spending these huge amounts on travel, but they all bring back lots of omiyage,'' said Susumo Saito, chief economist here for a unit of Credit Suisse, using the Japanese word for gifts. ''The cumulative amounts have been getting very big,'' Mr. Saito said.   The typical Japanese tourist will go abroad for six to seven days, spending $1,750 on travel and an additional $1,000 or so on goods, according to the Japan Travel Bureau, the nation's largest travel agent.   The favorite destinations are in the Pacific Rim. More than a million Japanese visited Hawaii last year, and a similar number also traveled to South Korea and to Hong Kong.   Japan's travel deficit with the United States alone represented more than a third of its worldwide travel gap in 1988. This year, a growing number of young Japanese are booking trips to New York and San Francisco, Japanese travel agents say.   Just why the Government and economists are taking notice is clear from the impact the travel boom is having on Japan's current account, the broadest measure of a nation's trade performance with the rest of the world, including trade in both goods and services.   In the first 10 months of this year, Japan's current-account surplus shrank in dollar terms by 23.5 percent, to $48.6 billion, from the period a year earlier. Government economists now predict that for the full year the current-account surplus could be less than $60 billion, well under the $71 billion forecast earlier and down sharply from the peak of $87 billion in 1987. Would Slow Rise in Wealth    To be sure, there are many frictions between the United States and Japan that a reduction in the current-account surplus would not solve. These include American assertions that Japanese markets remain closed to items like semiconductors, wood products, supercomputers and satellites. But a sustained decline in the current-account surplus would slow Japan's extraordinary accumulation of wealth in recent years.   In the arithmetic of trade figures, the travel deficit is part of the ledger dealing with ''invisible trade,'' which includes services, fees, royalties and investment income. The other part of the ledger concerns merchandise, or ''visible,'' trade. Most of the negotiations between the United States and Japan have been over the merchandise trade balance.   A declining Japanese current-account surplus could have a significant impact on Japan's purchasing power abroad, reducing its investment in the United States on everything from real estate to Treasury bonds and hampering the competitiveness of Japanese banks overseas.   ''This is why you hear the Japanese Government talking a lot more about the current account than the visible trade balance, where there hasn't been as much progress,'' said Kenneth S. Courtis, senior economist here for Deutsche Bank. ''And the travel deficit is behind it.''   Some economists agree with Mr. Watanabe that the travel boom could do more to shrink Japan's capital surpluses than all the measures being planned for increasing the country's imports and opening its markets to foreign goods. 'An Enormous New Market'    ''What people are starting to realize is that this is not just a change for Japanese consumers, but is changing consumption around the world because of how much Japanese tourists are spending overseas,'' Mr. Courtis said. ''You have some 10 million high spenders going abroad each year. It's an enormous new market that is going to continue to grow.''   On the front lines of this new army of travelers, life can be hectic. Takeshi Saito, manager of the overseas sales department for the bustling Shinjuku office of the Japan Travel Bureau, said his office's sales had more than doubled this year from 1988.   As young people nearby studied pamphlets for package trips to Australia, Hawaii and Europe, Mr. Saito noted that he had increased his staff by 30 percent to keep up with the demand. He pointed out that domestic travel has also boomed. A Different Tourist Now    Along with the boom is a change in the tourist, reflecting Japan's growing self-confidence. The days of Japanese travel groups moving through museums, hotels, restaurants and stores in lockstep, wearing the same tour hats, carrying the official tour bags and following a flag-waving tour leader also seem to be ending.   ''No more hats, no more bags,'' Mr. Saito said. ''Things have changed 100 percent. Especially the younger people. They want more free time when they get someplace.''   Many Japanese who make up the country's roving army of frequent fliers had to be forced as recently as two years ago to take Saturdays off and use their vacation time.   The Japanese Government lent its rhetorical support to the new spirit. Three years ago it declared its ''10 million plan,'' an effort to cajole that many Japanese to travel abroad. But the Government took almost no practical steps to raise interest in travel. Nonetheless, and to everyone's surprise, the goal has been met two years earlier than hoped.   Japan enforced rigorous travel restrictions in the postwar years to keep the nation's precious capital resources at home and to help rebuild the economy. 'Saved All the Time'    ''People were used to being conservative and saved all the time because the Government told them it was necessary,'' said Manabu Kanematsu, president of the Japan Association of Travel Agents, a trade group. ''But when they heard the Government, even the prime minister, encouraging them to use their savings and to travel, people really became more positive, more relaxed.''   Mr. Kanematsu also said that overseas travel has become a way for Japanese, whose living standard at home has been stunted by dauntingly high costs for housing and luxury goods, to begin to feel the wealth they had been reading about.   ''People who live in the smallest houses here want the biggest hotel rooms when they travel overseas,'' Mr. Kanematsu said.  The Japanese travel boom appears to have a great deal of room for growth. Compared with people in many other industrialized countries, Japanese are still homebodies. Britain, for example, with less than half the population of Japan, has three times as many overseas travelers.   ''They're way behind other countries,'' Mr. Courtis said. ''I think we can still expect a lot of catching up.''

Whipping Up Canapes on Short Notice
LEAD: ONE of the treasures of the kitchen is a recipe for hors d'oeuvres that can be whipped up at the last minute with ingredients that are always on hand.

CRIME
LEAD: It seemed appropriate, in keeping with the spirit of the holidays, to root around in current mystery releases for some nice books.

But to long-time experts in the social services it is markedly different.


In China, I'd Be Dead
LEAD: I was the deputy commander of the student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.
Last April, May and June, Chinese students nonviolently petitioned their Government to discuss human rights and put an end to corruption.
Great expectation and hope filled the air.
It was our spring.
Now it is our winter.


PORTRAIT OF THE 1980's; Selections From 10 Years of History
LEAD: What happened?
Morning in America, hole in the ozone, Oliver North, AIDS, terrorists, contras like Founding Fathers, $640 toilet seats, triumph of democracy, just say no.  1980  It's America vs. the Soviet Union, Khomeini, Castro, inflation and Jimmy Carter.


Pastimes; Stamps
LEAD: Of all of the labels known generically as cinderellas, Christmas seals have proved the most consistently attractive to collectors.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: Forget what will or won't be done in the year coming up.
Think of the past 12 months and the things that were done that left a happy glow of satisfaction.
And give a smaller thought to the things that were not done, and possibly regretted.


Upheaval in the East: Soviet Union; Baltic Separatists' Efforts Anger a Frayed Gorbachev

Lithuania
LEAD: To the Editor: It has taken me some time to digest an experience that I still do not know whether to consider exhilarating or distrubing.
Earlier this year I went for the second time to the Soviet Union to get a flavor of today's climate compared to one I experienced in 1982.
I was looking forward particularly to three days in


Yachting; I.O.C. Letter Alters Olympic Eligibility
LEAD: International yachting officials in London paved the way last month for professional sailors to compete in the 1992 Olympics.

QUESTIONS FOR THE COSMOS
LEAD: TO THE EDITOR: Congratulations to Prof.
Robert Jahn of Princeton for having the courage to pursue his investigation of psychic phenomena (''Questions for the Cosmos,'' by Steve Fishman, Nov. 26).
That is exciting.
But as one who has participated in informal experiments testing such things as telepathy and psychometry (with startling results) and as someone who has read widely in the literature, I would ask: How many times do we have to prove that ESP exists?


A Story Of Christmas And War
LEAD: NIXEVILLE-BLER COURT, France, appears on no map, or in any atlas readily available to Americans, but I have a favorite Christmas story -actually a 20-minute interlude during the course of one Christmas day -that took place there.
I don't yearn nostalgically for that day of yore, but when I think about it I feel nurtured, as though I am slaking a tremendous thirst.


Review/Music; Mendelssohn String Quartet Celebrates 10th Anniversary
LEAD: The players in the Mendelssohn String Quartet look too young to be celebrating their 10th anniversary.
But the ensemble was formed in 1979, and has been the resident ensemble at the Hebrew Arts School since 1981.
On Tuesday evening, the group played the first of three anniversary programs at Merkin Concert Hall.


Not a Perfect Holiday, Just a Happy One
LEAD: IT is Christmas Eve.
I've shifted into overdrive, madly wrapping last-minute purchases to put under the tree, when I hear, Thump!
Thump!
Thump! above my head.
It's too early for reindeer hooves to be prancing and pawing on the roof, or perhaps too late.
I haven't heard that noise for many years - and then it was only a faint echo in my imagination as


Setting High Tech Free
LEAD: Earlier this month U S West Inc. made a successful bid to lay a fiber-optics network in the Soviet Union.
Last week, the Commerce Department indicated it would allow the deal to go through.

These exports are currently limited by the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, called Cocom, which includes 17 Western countries.


Glory Days for Big Exhibitions, Continued
LEAD: IN TERMS OF THE BIG-SCALE MUSE-um exhibition, the 1980's went out in glory, both in the United States and in Europe.

Getting Breaks On Hotel Rates

The reservations clerk said the standard room rate was $150.
I plunged ahead:


When Leverage Works

Personal Voices Made Plays Worth Watching
LEAD: THERE CAN HARDLY BE ANY doubt that the playwright who mattered most in 1989 was Vaclav Havel.
In a year when the world was changing as fast as, if not faster than, at any other time in this century, Mr.
Havel was one of the people who changed it - first as a dissident dramatist and now as a political leader shaping the future of Czechoslovakia.


Karen Perlmutter Engaged

Rock's Own Generation Gap, From Pauls Abdula to the Who
LEAD: POPULAR MUSIC HAD A BUSY decade - dividing and recombining genres, tuning in to the world, championing causes, conquering and adapting to television, facing censorship attempts, mastering and being transformed by digital technology.
In 1989, it hoped to act like entertainment, simply selling dance records, filling auditoriums and cashing in on the past.

If You're Thinking of Living in: South River
LEAD: A WALK through South River is a stroll through New Jersey's past.
The center of the 2.8-square-mile borough, which was once the commercial hub of western Middlesex County, has changed little since the turn of the century, when most of its houses and stores were built.
Main Street still has a 5 &amp; 10, a Chinese laundry and a barber shop with a barber pole out front.


Tutu, Visiting Jerusalem, Backs Palestinian Statehood
LEAD: As troops and protesters clashed in Bethlehem, Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu of South Africa began a Christmas pilgrimage to the Holy Land today, offering support for the creation of a Palestinian state and for Israel's ''independence and territorial integrity.''


The Books He Left Behind
LEAD: To the Editor:


Dentists Fail to Smile in Response to 'Smile, Darn You, Smile'
LEAD: One profession that has continually looked at eradicating a need for itself is dentistry.
This is not being done by a group of second-rate, money-hungry clods, as described by Barbara Klaus in her article ''Smile, Darn You, Smile''  [ ''Long Island Sound,'' Dec. 3 ] .
The work is being carried on by some of the brightest research and clinical people in the world who have created a 70 percent reduction in decay over the past 20 years, reduced the incidence of periodontal disease in adults, consistently improved the comfort of care, and contributed greatly to the overall good health of people t


STREETSCAPES: The Civic Center Synagogue; Constrasting Styles Are Startling on White Street
LEAD: THE Civic Center Synagogue at 47 White Street is just the kind of building planners warn against.
Built in 1965, it replaced an unusual 1866 neo-Grec loft building, startlingly interrupting an otherwise intact 19th-century streetscape, one of the finest in the four proposed TriBeCa historic districts, or even in the city.


After a Decade Of Catching Up, Prices Soar Anew
LEAD: IN ANTIQUES AS IN ART, THEJU astounding prices paid at auction for certain rarities became the most discussed development of the last year - and the decade.
The fallout from recent sales of pieces of furniture and decorative art for the seven-figure prices formerly reserved for Renoirs and Rembrandts is bound to be felt for years to come.


Fighting for Their Lives
LEAD: To the Editor:


Don't Give Up on Junk Bonds
LEAD: RECENTLY, I participated on a panel with leaders of the House and Senate to discuss mechanisms for increasing investment in distressed communities.
None of the communities or minority businesses we discussed were investment grade.
Rather, they were completely unbankable, and most credit analyses by rating agencies would classify them as ''junk'' investments.

LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Denys Raymond Carr of Normanton, Yorkshire, England, have announced the engagement of their daughter, Theresa Margaret Carr, to William Van Muran, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Humbug: When Gifts Become Problems
LEAD: THE Swatch watch doesn't tick; the picture on the Sony television is fuzzy; the mittens you sent your daughter from the mail-order house don't match.
As the long-awaited unveiling of gifts gets under way this holiday season, a lot can - and often does - go wrong.
What recourse do gift givers and recipients have?

From the 'Music Box' Emerges the Nazi Demon
LEAD: FOR SOME CHILDREN, THE question is as innocent as the birds and the bees: ''What did you do in the war, Daddy?'' But for the American writer Joe Eszterhas, that question was never innocent.
It was one of the central terrors of his childhood, of growing up in the shadow of the Holocaust.

For this is the year of the empty nest, both of our offspring finally in college.


The King of Beers Raises the Ante
LEAD: IT is obvious that it is the king around here.
Drive past its mammoth corporate headquarters a few miles south of downtown, and you spy the people filing in, day after day, to board the bus tour, thread through the brewery and meander around the stable to gawk at the famous Clydesdales.
Many of the faithful then pay further obeisance by snapping up souvenir shirts and mugs at the tour center and then - why not?

LIVING WITH STYLE: North versus South; There's no place like away from home on the Holidays
LEAD: There are those who can't make up their minds until the last split second.
Should they start the winter solstice basking in the sun or schussing down the slopes?
Designer Calvin Klein and his wife, Kelly, are like that.
Today will find them either on sunny St.
Barts or in frosty Aspen.
Wherever, they will not be wanting for fellow celebrants.

Sports People; All-Stars and Stripes
LEAD: WHEN the Blue-Gray All-Star football game is played in Montgomery, Ala., tomorrow, Charlie Finley will be glowing like a Yuletide log.

Christmas Display Spreads Too Much Cheer
LEAD: CHRISTMAS EVE is a night when many families drive around various Connecticut towns to view holiday displays, as they prepare to open presents tomorrow morning.

Stewart Looks Past Oakland's Shadows
LEAD: THE day is still not over, but shadows and the temperature have begun to fall quickly as Dave Stewart drives slowly down Center Street, turns left onto 15th and then finally pulls to a stop at Cypress Avenue.

''It gives one the chance of shining right through the 20th century with a reflected light.


Officeholders Need Renewal of Ethics
LEAD: Each day's newspaper brings additional revelations of misconduct or criminal behavior on the part of elected or appointed officials.
What is particularly saddening is the fact that the public does not respond in outrage.
The attitude seems to be, ''What do you expect of politicians and public servants?


Wall Street's Arbitration System: Friend or Foe?
LEAD: ''WHEN Naivete Meets Wall Street'' (Dec. 3) drew many letters from readers.
The article examined the way investor complaints have been handled on Wall Street in the aftermath of a United States Supreme Court decision in May 1987 upholding the securities industry's right to compel customers to submit their complaints to an industry-run arbitration forum.

Irish Harps

My lever system is not operated by rotating an off-center screw, it's adjusted by doing so.

PORTRAIT OF THE 1980's; Trivial Pursuits And Huge Thoughts

LEAD: The holly reds and pine greens of the holiday season are mirrored in one of the season's surprise fashion fads: Austrian loden garments and other Tyrolean wear.


ART 'Once Upon a Time' Is a Twice-Told Tale
LEAD: TWO shows with the same title, ''Once Upon a Time,'' have opened and both are fun.
The fun in the Scarsdale Historical Society's version is educational; that in the Pelham Art Center's somewhat commercial.
But in this opinion, the two taken together make entertainment as good as a trek to the Christmas displays at Rockefeller Center, although Robert Heitmann, the artist featured at Scarsdale, can be seen in

MORE/On Film
LEAD: It was a poor year for foreign films, a fine one for talented American newcomers and a year that found a number of cinematic mainstays going strong.
It was also a year that brought a bumper crop of sorry spinoffs.
None of my top 10 films is a sequel. ''BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.'' Like all of Oliver Stone's films, this one aims directly for the solar plexus.

Abortion Viewed as Human Rights Issue
LEAD: In a recent article appearing in the Long Island Weekly, certain facts concerning my successful re-election campaign were incorrectly stated.
The article read, ''Mr.
Dillon, a Roman Catholic, said during the campaign that his opposition to abortion derives from his religious beliefs.'' I never said that and, to the contrary, I have always said that my position is based on the scientific evidence that human life begins at conception, and the ethical principle that it is always wrong to unjustifiably kill innocent human life.

Even now, a placard announcing Sunday Mass at noon and a white wooden cross over the front door are the only outward and visible signs that this mustard-colored square structure with its gray tar-paper roof is a church.

A Gift Wrapped in Anticipation
LEAD: THE magic of Christmas is a fleeting gift of childhood.
Once gone, it can almost never be recaptured.
As the season approaches, a brief glimmer of a long ago Christmas will be recalled by a carol overheard, the sparkle of a decoration or the familiar scent of fresh pine.

LEAD: VIRTUE, AS THE CHINESE SAYING goes, is not hereditary - and neither, to offer a paraphrase, is talent.

Civilization and Savagery Collide in Metaphor

TALKING: Neighbors; Dealing With Noise Or Worse

Fighting The War Machine
LEAD: Thank you for your article about Kathy Boylan, our Island's most prominent peace activist  [ ''About Long Island: Waging Protest Against the Machines of War,'' Oct. 1 ] .

Style Makers; Mark Anderson, Designer
LEAD: Mark Anderson Design made its name in graphics: product packaging and annual reports for Apple Computer; trade-show exhibits for Herman Miller and U S Sprint.

ANTIQUES: The 1990's Await What Was New A Century Ago
LEAD: ''Old, not modern'' is how Dr.
Johnson defined ''antiques'' in his 18th-century dictionary.
In 1930, when United States Customs tackled the question, it came up with the more precise regulation that an antique was a work of art or a handicraft made before 1830, giving rise to the accepted notion that a genuine antique must be 100 years old - at least to pass through Customs duty-free.

LEAD: THE captors held my husband and me for six years.

STAGE VIEW: An Intimate Look at Beckett the Man
LEAD: Samuel Beckett, who died Dec. 22 at the age of 83, was not only the pre-eminent playwright of his time, he was the most influential of artists.
Shaping his drama around his perception of the impermanence of life, he greeted existential absurdities with characteristic humor.
His signature brand of uproarious pessimism is represented by the statement made by Nell, the mother encased in an ashcan in ''Endgame'': ''Nothing is funnier than unhappiness.


The World; The Call of Separatism Rings in Gorbachev's Ear
LEAD: Lenin once condemned czarist Russia as a ''prison house of nations,'' and put part of the blame for the country's social and political problems on the myriad peoples forced together under the czar's hand.

It has to do with my grandfather.
He was kind and helpful, and most of all, he was like a second father to me, but I don't understand why he smoked.


Faster, The 1980's:When Information Accelerated
LEAD: No decade stands alone.
As Thomas Mann observed, ''it is only we mortals who ring bells and fire off pistols'' when the calendar flips from years numbered 80-something to years numbered 90.
The Roaring Twenties arose from the roar of war in the preceding decade and collapsed into a roaring depression in the next.


Pastimes; Camera
LEAD: What kind of year was 1989?
Not a bad one, if new films and cameras are your ultimate fantasies.

Legendary Lunch
LEAD: To the Editor: About once a month, I am a day-tripper to New York City.

Sports of The Times; The 80's: An Improbable Decade in Sports
LEAD: WITH the calendar approaching 1990, it's fashionable to assess what has happened since the calendar was turned to 1980, a decade in sports when money got bigger but not necessarily better, when ''drug rehab'' and ''Olympic boycott'' entered our vocabulary.
It's also fashionable to assess ''the best'' of the decade.


OFFICIALS AND WHAT THEY REPRESENT
LEAD: In her article ''Power Lines and Battle Lines'' (Opinion Page, Nov. 5), Amy Handlin asks (Rhetorically, I hope), ''Are not public officials elected to represent the emotions and fears, as much as the tangible needs, of their constituents?'' I cant' help but wonder if she would approve of such responsibilities as they were once manifested, namely, in electing officeholders who played upon the public fears of certain minorities and other ''undesirables'' moving in.

LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.

Msgr.
Paul M. Bresnehan and the Rev.
David Andrews, a Congregational minister, performed the ceremony.


Musicales and Anniversaries
LEAD: THE concert schedule usually takes awhile to recover fully from the holiday break, and next Sunday at 4, the First Congregational Church of Greenwich will help bring in a return to musical normalcy with a weekly series of hourlong candlelight events.

One difference, though, is the S-VHS option.

LEAD: As American troops sought to secure order here last week after having ousted Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega from power, the American invasion of Panama turned into an occupation.


West Side Preservation

Flaws in Panama Attack; Critics Cite Civilian Deaths, Noriega Escape And High Rate of Special-Forces Casualties
LEAD: Pentagon officials insist that the American intervention in Panama successfully demonstrated the armed forces' proficiency at airborne operations.

ANOTHER ASPECT OF CHILD SUPPORT
LEAD: In regard to the article ''Helping Women With Child Support'' (New Jersey Q &amp; A, Nov. 19): The efforts of Sandy Feld and Aware are to be applauded.
The fact that there are deadbeat dads who don't pay child support is reprehensible.
It makes all dads look bad.
However, on behalf of the innocent children of divorce everywhere, there might be other factors to consider.


Lifestyle: Sunday Menu; When Onions Are Stars of the Show
LEAD: To enjoy the full flavor of cooked onions, it isn't enough to cook them just until they are soft; they must be soft and golden brown.
It takes a little longer, but it is worth the time.
In this Indian-style lamb recipe, the onions are used as a topping, preserving their texture and their sweetness, which is usually partly lost when they are combined with other ingredients.


Nautical Flavor for Mixed Use
LEAD: A new mixed-use development with a nautical motif has been completed in what was once an industrial area in South Norwalk, Conn.

Working For an Unknown, Arif Nasr
LEAD: WHO is Arif Nasr? reads the sign we created to display at one town fair.

LEAD: To the Editor:


How'd I Do?
LEAD: Dear David, When you and I recently appeared together before a large crowd out in Brighton Beach, I began by telling the people, ''I want to thank everyone out there who voted for me.
I appreciate it.'' Then, I added, ''I also want to thank everyone who didn't - you liberated me.''


The Memphis Belle Takes the Air - and Screen - Again
LEAD: It was, says David Puttnam of his first film since he resigned as chairman of Columbia Pictures two years ago, ''very complicated to choreograph.'' For Michael Caton-Jones, it was ''a bit like trying to make Ben Hur with three horses, one of them rather old and sleepy.'' Neither the producer nor the director was greatly exaggerating.


Cliffhanger
LEAD: The Shawangunk cliffs tower like gothic ramparts over a sleepy valley west of New Paltz, N.Y.
Seen from a distance, they appear as impregnable as a fortress, and one might wonder how anyone could scale them.
But then at the base of the cliffs you discover that whenever rock is deposited in such a massive formation, it is never entirely sheer.


Czech Couple Keep Eye on Homeland
LEAD: AS history is made in Prague, an American couple with strong ties to Czechoslovakia have watched the events on television in their home here.

Resolution For 1990: Renew Passport Soon

Here's one: Renew your passport first thing.

Things may not run that speedily again until well into the fall.

Wait Just a Second
LEAD: Poised on the brink of a new decade, the world will pause Sunday night for one second.
A ''leap second'' will occur at the very end of Dec. 31, 1989, making it the longest day of the year.
The reason is that the extra second is needed to keep the world's clocks in time with the rotation of the planet, according to Government timekeeping officials.


New Yorkers, etc.

THE HATED SEASON
LEAD: I deplore the acts described by Steven Lewis, as do all conscientious hunters.
He does a disservice by lumping us together with the unethical few who choose to violate laws and ignore the rights of landowners.

Remember This: Write What You Don't Know
LEAD: BEFORE the Reagan Administration cut off liberal money to the arts and humanities, I traveled around to a lot of posh little writing-teaching gigs.
They'd fly you in, you'd get a pile of manuscripts to look over and a bunch of students.
After some seminars and receptions, you'd take your check and fly home.


Pastimes; Stamps

Review/Dance; Linked by Chairs, in Dove's 'Vespers'
LEAD: Ulysses Dove's ''Vespers'' drew tumultuous cheers in a performance by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater on Friday night at City Center, and it is easy to see why.
Like ''Episodes,'' his new work this season, ''Vespers'' is an explosive dance set to driving percussive music.
But the older dance, performed to music by Mikel Rouse, is a purer conscious venture into formalism.

Corrections

Adding Insult
LEAD: To the Editor:


All About New Year's Eve
LEAD: What is it with New Year's Eve, anyway?
I don't think I've actually ever met anyone who liked it, and yet we all persist in celebrating.
It's a silly holiday, one of forced revelry, a night when - like the senior prom - reality can't possibly fulfill expectations.


Brilliant Silks Woven by Hand In Thailand
LEAD: ''PEEP SHOW,'' a mostly routine 1950 revue produced by Mike Todd, deserves at least a footnote in theatrical history as probably the only Broadway show ever to contain a song by a ruling monarch.
The number was ''Blue Night,'' written by Thailand's jazz-loving young King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
The show also brought Thai silk to the New York stage for the first time.


After Noriega; U.S. ADMITS ERROR IN SEARCHING HOME OF MANAGUA ENVOY

MUSIC: The Forgotten Schubert Is Getting Another Chance

RECORDINGS: The Past Raises Its Voice Once More
LEAD: As early as 1902 singers started putting their art on Mr.
Edison's fairly recent (1877) invention, only they recorded on flat disks rather than the cylinders favored by the inventor.
It is safe to say that every great singer, and thousands of lesser ones, made records.
Eventually their original records disappeared, but they were not lost.


Looking Back at a Disappointing Decade
LEAD: ALTHOUGH it's much too soon to be nostalgic for the 80's, it's hard to picture them being anyone's good old days.
For me the last decade had no memories as sweet as charlotte russes or mello rolls.

Foreign Missions Face Maze of Red Tape
LEAD: PROSPECTIVE tenants in New York often have to contend with costly real estate brokers, cranky landlords and choosy co-op boards.
But foreign governments at the United Nations in search of new office or living space have an additional complication: the United States Government.


Work, Women and Men
LEAD: A FEW months ago, I mentioned to some associates that I was thinking about writing an article on why I liked working with women.
Men invariably responded with flippancy, raised eyebrows, ribald chuckles or lewd innuendo.

Most wanted a full discussion of the subject right then and there.

LEAD: CONNECTICUT teachers who want to continue using binding arbitration to resolve contract disputes have received a boost from a legislative panel.


FILM FILM VIEW: Oliver Stone Takes Aim At the Viewer's Viscera
LEAD: THE CROWDS LINING UP AT THE Ziegfeld are liable to be a lot less festive than ordinary holiday moviegoers, even those on their way to see a big film whose star is surely Oscar bait.
In fact, they're apt to be experiencing serious apprehension. ''Born on the Fourth of July'' is a film with a painful subject, and it's the work of a director extremely adept at inflicting pain.


Commercial Property: Princeton Corridor; New Life for an Ambitious Remnant of the 80's Boom
LEAD: ONE of the most ambitious projects started in the development boom of the mid 1980's along the Princeton Corridor - the stretch of Route 1 between New Brunswick and Trenton, N.J. - was Princetonpark Corporate Center, a joint venture of the Seltzer Organization of Fort Washington, Pa., and Olympia &amp; York, the giant

THE ULTIMATE DECISION
LEAD: My mother is in the later stages of Alzheimer's disease.
Although she is otherwise in general good health, I know that one day I may face the same situation Andrew Malcolm did.
I struggle to remember any snatches of conversation that indicate what my mother's desires would be.
But each recollection that suggests yes is counterbalanced by another that suggests no.


Headliners; Happy New Year x 500,000
LEAD: Mikhail S. Gorbachev had better start addressing cards now if he intends to return by next New Year's Day the holiday greetings he was to receive this weekend.
James Lawlor of Fairfield, Iowa, said his idea was to send the Soviet President a huge card ''and have everybody in America sign it.'' A busy year later he ended up with an 800-foot-long ''card'' signed by a half-million people.

Q&amp;A
LEAD:  Last-Minute Travel Clubs


No Headline
LEAD: THERE are any number of reasons why our family found itself cooling off in the pastel blue water of a date palm irrigation reservoir in Ghardaia, Algeria, about to drive across the Sahara - too many Foreign Legion films in my youth, the indelible impression ''Lawrence of Arabia'' made on its original release, even the fact that, when we were children, my best friend had a sandbox while I did not.

LEAD: THE entrance to the Gazelle d'Or, the old converted hunting lodge of Baron Jean Pellenc in Taroudant, southwestern Morocco, is a long drive lined with whispering eucalyptus trees that bend and touch 30 feet overhead.

Campus Life: Washington State; After Thefts, Fraternity Faces Stiff Sanctions
LEAD: Kappa Sigma is the oldest nationally chartered fraternity at Washington State University.
It scheduled a dance for late October, and it needed some way to decorate its house.

When Justice Goes Wrong
LEAD:  JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE: Battered Women, Self-Defense, and the Law.
By Cynthia K. Gillespie. (Ohio State University, $24.95.) The idea in our law that it is excusable to kill in self-defense goes back to medieval England.
The cases that led to the development of the common law on self-defense fell into two classes: there were the highway-robber cases, where an unknown assailant sets upon someone who, in fighting back, kills his attacker; and then there were the barroom brawls, in which a dispute between two men escalates into a dangerous armed battle.

LEAD: An hour or so before dawn on New Year's Day, Jerry Kravat, a tall and rumpled figure in white tie and tails, comes home to his Upper West Side apartment, uncorks a bottle of champagne, presses buttons on his video-cassette recorder and reruns New Year's Eve.

Upheaval in the East: Espionage; It's Still Business as Usual for Spies, Even as the Eastern Bloc Rises Up
LEAD: For years, experts have dubbed Czechoslovakia's spy agency the ''two Czech'' service.
Agents of the Office for the Protection of State Secrets got one check from Prague, the pun goes, and another from their real bosses at K.G.B. headquarters in Moscow.


Fashion; Two New Stores That Cruise Fashion's Fast Lane
LEAD: One shop has a faux French accent and the other a real Spanish one, but they both speak the same fashion language.
It's a language understood by young fashion followers on a budget who nonetheless change their clothes as often as the color of their lipstick.
Two new boutiques on Lexington Avenue within a block of each other are now vying for these young women constantly seeking out the latest trend.


Review/Music; Alexander Schneider and Strings
LEAD: The annual holiday concerts of the New York String Orchestra under Alexander Schneider celebrate youth and experience.
This year's orchestra consisted of 63 players (including winds and a percussionist) between the ages of 15 and 22, assembled for the 81-year-old Mr.
Schneider's 11-day seminar.
The teaching, one suspects, must somewhat contradict what the students learn at modern academies, just as some of the conductor's interpretive choices depart from current notions of correct period practice.


Banking's High-Tech Retail Chase
LEAD: IN the battle among banks for retail customers, the victors are likely to be those that use high technology best.

Hunter Addition
LEAD: A $67 million addition to the Hunter College Campus Schools that would eventually make possible an increase in enrollment from the present 1,600 students to 2,200 is under consideration by the city.

Compensating for Filling In a Wetland
LEAD: A CENTURY of draining and road building, mosquito eradication and waste dumping has reduced the Hackensack Meadowlands to a featureless reed-choked vista that greets motorists driving the northern reaches of the New Jersey Turnpike.
Few birds sing, and about the only thing that nests in the once-fertile mud are discarded tires.


Q And A
LEAD:  Tax on Condominiums  Question: How are the real estate taxes on condominium apartments calculated?
Should similar apartments in the same building pay the same taxes? . . .
K.
B., Manhattan  Answer: According to Jeffrey Schanback, deputy commissioner for the property division in the city's Department of Finance, when tax apportionment assignments are first made for condominiums, the portion to be paid on each unit is also established.

It's no surprise to find the cartoon resurrected once again by Steven

Pastimes; Coins
LEAD: Money may at first seem an unlikely venue for propaganda.
But any coin in any pocket has a message.
Whether a bust of George Washington reminding us that we were the first of the great revolutionary governments or a profile of Lincoln reminding us of the Civil War and our experience with slavery.
Each coin has some meaning underlying the mundane utility of money.

Aiming High Under the Big Top
LEAD: IN Europe, the circus is not just something to take your kids to - grown men and the government fight about it passionately in the popular press.

GOOD TASTE
LEAD: WARM LENTIL SALAD, ROAST CHICK-en with mashed potatoes, scallops crusted in potato slivers, olive-flecked risotto and tarte Tatin.
These may have been the hot restaurant orders in 1989, but ''sauce on the side'' was the most uttered phrase.
In 1990, that request will become a mantra.

RECORDINGS: At Home in the Top 40 And Still Full of Kitsch
LEAD: It's taken 10 years for the imes to catch up with the B-52's.
With the Top 10 successes of their seventh album, ''Cosmic Thing'' (Reprise 9 25854, all three formats) and its hit single ''Love Shack,'' the group has finally moved beyond cult status.
The B-52's were always popular on college radio stations, but from the perspective of the early-80's mainstream, the group was a novelty act, at once studiously retro and unnervingly futuristic.


Memorable Meals: A Critic's Choices
LEAD: WHILE 1989 was not a banner year for discovering restaurants rated excellent, there was one clear winner in that league.
La Provence (86 Washington Street, South Norwalk, 855-8958) combines a comfortable decor inspired by the south of France, with food to match.
The restaurant, operated by two graduates of the Guy Savoy restaurant in Paris, features some of the most original and delicious fare to be found in Connecticut in years.

An explosion that shut down the nation's second-largest refinery, an Exxon complex in Louisiana, added to the upward pressure.
