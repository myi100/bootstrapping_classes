Commodities Exchange Seeks Advice
LEAD: The Chicago Board of Trade announced today that it had hired a former assistant United States attorney to advise it and its members on the use of Federal racketeering laws in white-collar crime cases.


Topics of The Times; 'Jan Palach Lives!'
LEAD: Two thousand demonstrators recently crowded the main square of Prague to honor the memory of Jan Palach, a 20-year-old student who immolated himself on Jan. 16, 1969.
Hundreds of them were beaten and scores were jailed, including Czechoslovakia's most renowned playwright, Vaclav Havel.


Review/Piano; Concentration And Finger Power
LEAD: Veda Zuponcic played an uncompromisingly difficult piano program on Monday evening at Weill Recital Hall.

'Soft' X-rays May Bring Better Computer Chips
LEAD: The race to build computer chips capable of storing thousands of times the information squeezed into today's most complex chips is almost certain to hinge on the development of a device that can generate X-rays that act much like light.
These longer, or ''soft,'' X-rays will still have wavelengths much shorter than visible light, making it possible to etch on silicon wafers circuits far finer than those being made with light and optical lenses.


How to Pay for Honest Government
LEAD: Nobody can be proud of the backhanded way Congress raises its members' salaries.
But experience shows that it's either that way or no way, because few members will risk political oblivion by voting publicly to increase their own pay.

On Stage
LEAD:  A 'Lampoon' for Broadway It's more than a dream, a gleam in the eye and even talk - nevertheless, it's still amorphous.
It's what producers describe as ''in development.'' But by fall, if everything goes according to plan, it should be a show called ''National Lampoon's American Tricentennial'' and, depending on which producer you're talking to, by the end of the year, or spring 1990, after regional tryouts, it should be on Broadway, at the Ritz


Our Towns; Some Neighbors Still Aren't Seen As Neighbors
LEAD: Like a lot of small-town newspapers, the Glen Cove Record-Pilot tries to stress the good.
If there's bad news, it usually gets played down.
For example, last week there was just one paragraph on a Glen Cove man charged with attempted murder.
The story did not name the man or his victim.
Maggie Polk, the editor, says that in sensitive matters it's best not to.

Brazil's Debt Can Save the Amazon
LEAD: Brazil owes the world $115 billion.
The world wants Brazil to stop recklessly destroying the Amazon rain forest, an extraordinary natural wonder.

The 'Challenge' of Bow Hunting
LEAD: I have read Thomas V. Connors's letter (''Ban on Bow Hunting Is Without Logic'' Jan. 22) reacting to mine (''Deer Hunting on Fire Island'' Jan 8) urging a ban not, unrealistically, on hunting per se, but on bow hunting only.
But I found myself distanced from understanding Connors's milieu even further by his reference to such weapons' use as a ''logical extension of hunting practices that outdate all but the cavemen's spear.

In Boston, Things Are Starting to Resemble the Bronx Zoo
LEAD: They don't open spring training for nearly two weeks and the Boston Red Sox already have expended a season's worth of turbulent energy.

Teen-Agers, AIDS And Abstinence

Cabinet Choice Fielding Hard Questions in Drills

Video/Hans Fantel; Videodisk Players Offer Double Value
LEAD: The recent revival and current mini-boom of videodisks was sparked not only by the swift expansion of the disk repertory.
The growing popularity of this hitherto neglected video medium owes a great deal to several excellent and versatile videodisk players by Yamaha, Sony and Pioneer.
This radically updated playing equipment now makes videodisks attractive to a growing number of viewers eager for the utmost in picture quality.

Spicy Cooking Adds Heat to a Cold Day

From Italy, the American Southwest and from China, the following recipes are simple to make - and a little exotic.
They are also light and extremely low in saturated fats.


WHAT'S DOING IN: Bombay
LEAD: Bombay is India's richest and most vibrant city, its capital of entrepreneurship, its fashion center, home to the country's movie industry and leader in the performing arts.
The city's skyline resembles downtown Manhattan's, but the high-rise buildings of south Bombay, with their glittering jewelry and dress showrooms, contrast sharply with the hovels and poverty of sidewalk dwellers.


A Memorable Ride
LEAD: MR.
BRADLEY, MY neighbor from across the hall, offered me a ride to work the other day.
Not a remarkable occurrence in itself: I'm sure people all over the country are offered rides to work every day.
But this is New York City.
Not only do people not offer you rides; most of them don't even own cars.


Have You Seen Many Cows in Norwalk County?
LEAD: IF you ask me where I live, I'm going to lie.
I'm going to say that I live on Main Street in Westport, 10 feet from the front door of the Westport Library, 15 feet from my office and my Rolodex.
I won't lie because I'm trying to impress you with my Westport address.
It's just that I'm sick of trying to explain why

Question Of the Week; What Do The Mets Need to Add In 1989?
LEAD: Oh sure, the Mets could always use some more good pitching.
But what they really need they can't buy.
They need to act more like a team, to toot their own horns less, to let their actions speak for themselves.
See Kevin McReynolds.
ANNIE MAHR  Somerset, N.J.


The Case of the Purloined Party
LEAD: MARDI GRAS is invariably associated with New Orleans.
However, the event is a regional one and actually started in 1704 in Mobile, Ala., a smaller, more provincial city 150 miles east of New Orleans.
As the celebration has flowered in Louisiana, Mobilians have become truculent and defensive about their party, which seems to have abandoned them like an ungrateful son who ran after a painted woman, settling down happily in the sin and carelessness of New Orleans.


Quayle's Warning to Salvador: Aimed at Congress
LEAD: Vice President Dan Quayle's sharp warning Friday to the Salvadoran Armed Forces to respect human rights was aimed as much at the United States Congress and American audiences as at the army or any officials here, American officials accompanying the Vice President said.


Tough Guessing Game on Worldwide Toll of AIDS

Review/Dance; Music by Tchaikovsky In a City Ballet Evening
LEAD: The New York City Ballet danced an all-Tchaikovsky program on Friday night at the New York State Theater, thereby honoring one of the ballet world's greatest composers.
Curiously, not one of the three choreographic works was accompanied by a score specifically written for dancers.
Yet Tchaikovsky's orchestral and instrumental music is so rhythmically supple and emotionally expressive that it can easily send dancers whirling.


Sleeping Pills
LEAD: IN THE DIM LIGHT OF MY bathroom, I looked into a vial at a dozen oval, sky-blue sleeping pills.
I was getting desperate.
At 2 A.M., an emergency-room doctor at the hospital had awakened me to get some advice.
Since then, my brain had buzzed without mercy.
I tried all the rituals of the insomniac until 3:30, when I pulled out my rarely used bottle of Halcion with the anxiety of someone hesitant to plunge into the unknown known.


Is January The Cruelest Month?
LEAD: My idea of movie hell is a place where the floors stick, the sound is half a second out of sync, the person behind me repeats every punchline to his companion and the only films to be seen are the kind that get released in January.
It's well known that January films have a character that is, let us say, distinctive.

The director, Yuri Yeremin, who has adapted the work from an unproduced screenplay by Alexander Chervinsky, is making his American debut with this production.


The Deficit Melts if Spending Is Fixed
LEAD: The question of how to reduce the chronic Federal Government deficit is on the front burner.
The flexible freeze concept, which I developed in 1978 and presented to George Bush - who was running for President - at a meeting in Kennebunkport, Me., in August of that year.
The freeze appeared then - as it does now - to be the most economically sound and politically feasible approach to reducing the deficit.


Belaga Moves to TV
LEAD: JULIE D. BELAGA, the former gubernatorial candidate, has taken a job in television, following the path of another former Connecticut politician, Toby Moffett.


Review/Music; Improvisatory Double Bill
LEAD: Thursday's double bill at the Kitchen was a bit less than gripping.
While good portions of a piece by Lawrence (Butch) Morris played by the Spring Quartet had some tension, the work lasted too long.
And while the music and poetry played and read by the Marilyn Crispell trio - which doubles as three-quarters of the Anthony

LEAD: Between 50 and 70 teen-agers on a late-night rampage overturned tables and knocked over wastebaskets at a Burger King restaurant in lower Manhattan, the police said yesterday.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Our clapboard garage is built on a cement-block foundation and is on sloping ground.
On one side, the bottom row of clapboards is one foot above ground level, but on the other side the bottom row is nine inches below grade.
This is one foot from our neighbor's property line, so it is impossible to regrade the soil.

LEAD: FINES and tow-away threats hardly faze illegal parkers in New York City.
But a garish, gooey piece of paper is making them pay attention, the Sanitation Department says.


The Boom in New York City Bed-and-Breakfasts
LEAD: When New Yorkers think of bed-and-breakfasts, they might imagine a New England farmhouse in the woods or a European cottage by the sea.
Rarely would they think of looking down the block or right next door.


Pianists Playing to a Different Drummer
LEAD: Stylistic categories in music may not be disappearing, but they are certainly shifting with a frequency that alarms some and excites others.
In recent months, three pianists who emerged from the world of jazz have released records that extend eagerly into the classical arena.


Getting Around
LEAD: As she often does on royal tours, the Princess of Wales mingled with high society and society's less fortunate on her three-day trip to New York last week to promote British products and the Welsh National Opera.
There was the glitter of the opera at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and an elegant charity dinner at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center.


A Way for Commuters to Help Homeless
LEAD: The Long Island Rail Road commuters can help the homeless in Penn Station.
By purchasing a one-way ticket to Woodside ($2.50), the homeless person will now have a right to this public place -- Penn Station -- just as you and I. (Ticket good for one year).


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Our clapboard garage is built on a cement-block foundation and is on sloping ground.
On one side, the bottom row of clapboards is one foot above ground level, but on the other side the bottom row is nine inches below grade.

Dear Grandchildren
LEAD: The Federal Government has fallen steadily deeper in debt for eight years now, but the sky hasn't fallen.
The nation prospers; interest and inflation rates remain subdued.

LEAD: Reflecting different priorities from the Reagan Administration's, President Bush plans to ask Congress Thursday for increased Federal spending in several domestic areas, including education, environmental protection, fighting illegal drugs and helping historically black colleges, Bush aides said.


Not Just at Home on the Range
LEAD: Images from an American-art show: Adirondack lakes at sundown, brilliant apple-green water under a chrome sky.
Winter light on snowy Connecticut hills.
A tabletop bronze of society polo players, men and mounts tangled, twisting, falling.
All bear a single signature: Frederic Remington.
Remington?
Where is the Wild West of horses and sagebrush?


Ending Sidetracks
LEAD: It seemed to be all downhill for Frank L. McNamara Jr. after his appointment as the United States Attorney for Massachusetts in 1987.
The Senate Judiciary Committee held up his confirmation because of questions about his income tax returns.
Some of his staff complained that his decisions on key personnel matters were politically motivated.

The Rev.
David Kaiser performed the ceremony.


Nicaragua Currency Tumbles And American Dollar Is King
LEAD: A recent commercial for the state-run television company here has all the makings of a tear-jerker: a lonely evening, a grandmotherly caller, loved ones living abroad.
But just as viewers pick up the phone to reach out and touch someone, the announcer adds a selfish suggestion: Don't pay for it yourself - call collect.

A Sign Of Change
LEAD: He won't take over as National League president until April 1, but Bill White has already performed his first official duty: providing the Rawlings Sporting Goods Company with the signature that will appear on all National League balls.


Professional Pointers
LEAD: LAST week's up-and-down thermometer was especially difficult for plants because, to date, there has been no snow cover, nature's blanket, to protect them.
Spring/summer will be wait-and-see seasons to assess any damage, particularly to buds, which may swell in ''false spring'' temperatures only to be clobbered by the cold.


When the Law Becomes Big Business
LEAD: The law has become big business.
Today, several firms have more than 1,000 attorneys, with gross revenues of $250 million or more.
Modern ''mega-firms'' emphasize profitability, productivity and business generation in an atmosphere of competitiveness and bureaucracy.
But as these firms grow, some of the values important to the practice of law have been sacrificed.


Review/Dance; Eliot Feld's Classical Pastiche
LEAD: ''A Footstep of Air'' was always one of Eliot Feld's jollier ballets, and Friday night's revival of this 1977 work - the first since 1985 - is a welcome one.


THE GIFT OF LIFE
LEAD: It was with great difficulty that I read William Squadron's article ''Two Lives on Hold'' (Dec. 18).

FICTION
LEAD:  THE BODY POLITIC.
By Victor Gold and Lynne Cheney. (St. Martin's, $15.95.) When art seeks so blatantly to imitate life, one asks, at the minimum, that it be done creatively.
In ''The Body Politic,'' a slim novel annotated with fictitious transcripts and official-looking memorandums that attempts to hook readers with its snapshots of power plays inside the White House and on Capitol Hill, it unfortunately is not.

Fiat Fights to Stay on Top in Europe

IF YOU'RE THINKING OF LIVING IN: Westport
LEAD: FIFTY years ago Westport was known as the ''Hollywood of the East,'' with Bette Davis and F. Scott Fitzgerald making their homes in the bucolic town along Long Island Sound.

Paul Newman and Phil Donahue live in secluded parts of town, and Main Street, which is lined with chic boutiques, is often referred to as ''the Rodeo Drive of Connecticut.

Peaks and Valleys in Papp's Marathon
LEAD: When it comes to amassing culture, Americans like to collect the complete set.
This is the impulse that leads us to sign up for the Book-of-the-Month Club when it offers every last volume of Will and Ariel Durant, or to dial an 800 number when Vincent Price beckons us from the depths of cable television to purchase recordings of all the world's great music on the installment plan.

LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Our clapboard garage is built on a cement-block foundation and is on sloping ground.
On one side, the bottom row of clapboards is one foot above ground level, but on the other side the bottom row is nine inches below grade.
This is one foot from our neighbor's property line, so it is impossible to regrade the soil.


Budget Conjecture Widening Tensions

What Was Lost In Afghanistan
LEAD: IN 1979, as tens of thousands of Soviet troops streamed into Afghanistan, Moscow's strategy seemed straightforward and completely in line with its world view: A bold military strike, reminiscent of moves into Hungary and Czechoslovakia, would prevent insurrection and chaos from toppling a pro-Soviet and Marxist regime.


Exposure and Light How to Overcome the Reciprocity Failure
LEAD: HAVE you ever taken pictures just after sunset and found later that they come out underexposed with an unattractive shade of green?

THE REGION: A Warm Economy; New York Is About to Find Out What Happens After a Boom
LEAD: TRUE to predictions, 1988 marked the abrupt end of Wall Street's boom.

LEAD: Continuing the discusions of deer population control, Thomas V. Connors (Letters to the Editor, Jan. 22) pleads that logic should prevail in governmental decisions affecting animal conservation.

LEAD: In the beginning was the Astrodome, plopped down in 1965 like a wayward flying saucer in a sweltering pasture south of downtown Houston.


TOUGH TALK FOR DEMOCRATS
LEAD: Joseph Califano's talk to Democrats was not only tough, but so cynical it will fail to serve his party in any way.
All he explains is how to take some votes away from Republicans.
He does not address the larger problem: how to persuade the other half of the electorate - the half that does not vote at all - to go to the polls.

LEAD: AMONG the new crop of Manhattan apartment buildings, none is more striking than the sleek glass giant called One East River Place, which Sheldon Solow is completing off 72d Street at the East River.

Dion James, the other Brave, is the only other player whose case has been decided in arbitration.


Question Of the Week; What Do The Mets Need to Add In 1989?
LEAD: The Mets need to add nothing.
With the team they have now, they could easily win the Series.

LEAD: The German strain of contemporary dance as it has manifested itself in the United States is usually overlooked if not unacknowledged.
There is general agreement that modern dance, a 20th-century phenomenon, has been dominated by Americans.

To West Germans, The Far Right Isn't Just Another Fringe
LEAD: BY the standards of most functioning democracies, a rise of fever on the far right in times of stress is not a cause for undue alarm, unpleasant as it may be to acknowledge the tenacity of xenophobia and bigotry.
But in West Germany the boundaries of political sentiment are still constrained by history and suspiciousness: While a shift to the left raises allied suspicions of a latent German longing for neutrality, a blip on the far right still touches off the ''neo-Nazi'' alarm.

LEAD: The runup in real estate prices over the past few years is leaving more and more owners with huge profits when they sell their properties.

A Gust of Competition in Meteorology
LEAD: Temperatures as low as 80 degrees below zero in Alaska over the last 10 days have wreaked untold damage - causing a few planes to crash, pipes to burst, utility wires to snap and industry to come to a virtual halt.

Doubts on Peary's Polar Feat Tied to Misreading of a Paper

People from all walks of life are now asking surgeons to fix their physical flaws, big and small, said a Waterbury cosmetic surgeon, Paula A. Moynahan.

THE GUNS OF SLAVADOR
LEAD: STILL HAGGARD AND GAUNT FROM his time in the mountains of El Salvador, the guerrilla official put a recording of a Haydn symphony on the stereo and sat down to talk.

LEAD: The Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif., has just published what is ostensibly the first novel to be written in English - and this, of course, raises all sorts of interesting questions.

A Letter To Martin
LEAD: MARTIN, the dream has faded and it is now wake-up time.

It is time to rise from the world of dreams.

Review/Music; Sixties Overview Ends With 3 From the East
LEAD: The 1960's are probably still too close to us, chronologically and emotionally, for anyone to be satisfied with an overview of its music, or even just its ''serious'' music.

Why General Mills May Go Up
LEAD: Long before the takeover battles for the Pillsbury Company and Kraft Inc. pushed up the stock prices of food companies, General Mills Inc.'s shares had been rising.

The Once And Future Jerseyans
LEAD: WE'VE all heard the jokes.
Some people actually still tell them.
You know the people I mean - those tardy trend-followers who have only now discovered Carribbean restaurants, Akitas and high-tech little telephones you can carry into the bathroom.

Shoreham Isn't Like Chernobyl

THE NATION: In Federal Departments; Are Judge and Agency Too Close for Justice?
LEAD: WHEN a corporation or a private citizen disputes a Federal agency's decision - involving, say, a disability pension or an allegation of unfair labor practices - an administrative law judge decides who is right.

Unlike the ''Polish Village'' series he unveiled after his 1970 retrospective at the Modern when his work announced his new allegiance to built-up reliefs, these pieces, all made in 1988, do not mark an exciting or surprising shift in direction, at least not in the visual sense.

Barenboim's Chicago Connection
LEAD: There are times when musical history seems determined to repeat old tunes, as if hoping this time to get them right.

Sharpening Chisels and Planes
LEAD: WOODWORKING chisels and at least one hand plane have a place in almost every household tool kit.
However, if you own such tools, learning how to sharpen them is as important as learning how to use them.
Dull cutting tools are ineffective.
They are also dangerous because they require more effort to use than sharp tools and so are more difficult to control.


Unchecked Thumbs On Nuclear Buttons
LEAD: The United States and its NATO allies continue to espouse a policy of first use of nuclear weapons.
We believe the President, Congress and the American public should reject this policy, including the early use of nuclear weapons in a crisis.

The New, Revealing Look of Taiwan Elections
LEAD: Elections used to be simple things here.
The ruling party would nominate candidates who would win elections, and candidates would wear clothes.


WHERE SHOULD BABY SLEEP?
LEAD: Melvin Konner does not take into account that, in 1989, the term ''parents'' frequently refers to one natural parent and one stepparent.

Bike to the Future
LEAD: ''THE ASSIGNMENT,'' SAYS C. Martin Smith, ''was to design a two-wheeled bicycle.
The design was to be market-driven.
That is, students would first identify an area of the market,'' and then tailor a design to it.
Standard homework, perhaps, for students of industrial design.
But Smith, associate chairman of the industrial design department at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena, Calif., says: ''We felt there was an opportunity to change the way a bicycle was manufactured.

Good Ethics Is Good Business - Really
LEAD: As scandals mount in the financial and commodities markets, economists theorize that the market determines one's ethicality.
If ''everybody'' cheats, those who don't will be wiped out.
Like much economic writing, this conclusion is not based on factual observations of ethical traders who went bankrupt, but on abstract theories about ''perfect competition.


Across the Seas The Game Is Popular
LEAD: THE power center of bridge in Europe has been slowly moving North for the past two decades.
In the 1950's and 1960's Italy, Britain and France regularly contended for the top honors in European Championships.

FOCUS: Cumberland, Me.; The Rich Gobble Up Coastal Hideaways
LEAD: WHEN residents of Cumberland, an affluent suburb of Portland, voted in December not to buy the 25-acre estate known as Conifer Ledges, they confirmed what many there have felt for some time: Oceanfront property has become too expensive for public agencies.
The estate would have given the community its only waterfront park.


Making a Safe Exit in an Airplane Emergency
LEAD: YOU know those cardboard sheets in airline seat pockets - the ones with pictures of the life jacket and oxygen mask and diagrams of exit doors?
I now read them with a lot more interest and even put a book down and watch the flight attendants' talk with something like curiosity.


Concern Over Race Seen in Westchester Study
LEAD: Well over half the people surveyed at a public meeting last month in White Plains said race relations in Westchester County were getting worse.

The couple in the 1963 LOVE WITH THE PROPER STRANGER (Paramount Home Video, $19.95), which is newly available on videocassette, are especially star-crossed, since the salesgirl (Natalie Wood) is already pregnant by the footloose musician (Steve McQueen) when the film begins.

At Heartbreak Hotel,Saxophones and Stolen Dreams
LEAD: In the swirling fog at the corner of Neon and Lonely Streets, by the bar of the Heartbreak Hotel, a ghostly figure in a trenchcoat and slouch hat steps out under a blue streetlight.
Launching into a smoky jazz-flavored ballad, James Taxi, a pint-size private eye, huskily drawls out an ode to rain-soaked streets at 2 in the morning, whisky and shining saxophones.


Wraparound Nighttime Glamour
LEAD: CHRISTMAS may be long gone, but there are still fancy wrappings around town.

LEAD: A grandmother who hadn't visited New York for a year arrived during the bustling holiday season via the Metroliner from Wilmington.

But I don't think we're ready for the Condo.
Not just yet.

Secrecy vs. Fairness
LEAD: 'I want to do my level best to protect the national secrets of this country.
But I want to do even more to give this man a fair trial.

It is a trial of Oliver North.' - Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, on a Justice Department proposal to censor testimony dealing with national security at Mr.

Respect the Fears Of Children
LEAD: Carl Bosch is understandably distressed at his 6-year-old daughter's awareness and fear of terrorism, following the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 (''What Do You Tell Children About Terrorism,'' Opinion page, Jan. 15).

He compounds the terror and brings the fear straight home by insisting that she fly with her parents, against her will, to that ''shrine of childhood, Disney World.


New Order Keeps Marching to Its Own Mystery
LEAD: How cool is coldness?
For the British band New Order, near ly a decade of cold standoffishness, musically and otherwise, has paid off with one of rock's most dedicated cult followings.

He had a job but in the chill of a hard winter, his wife and two children were shivering.

LEAD: Three mysterious fires broke out within hours of each other in metropolitan Manila, razing 2,000 houses and leaving up to 15,000 people homeless, police said today.
The first fire broke out Friday afternoon in Tondo, a Manila slum district, destroying about 2,000 houses in a four-block area.
Several people, mostly children, were missing but there were no reports of deaths, police said.


Trenary Captures Singles

CUSTOMIZED ART IS DISTINCTIVE BUT IS RARELY MOVED OR SOLD
LEAD: Because of the influence of professional art advisers, corporate art collections today include more than the traditional paintings and drawings.
Large-scale works custom-designed for particular sites - and therefore almost always commissioned - have become widespread.

WHERE SHOULD BABY SLEEP?
LEAD: Parents who sleep with their babies are likely to spend more time touching them, and there is much scientific support for the benefits of touching.
Touching has profound effects on growth and development.
Studies of the benefits of touching in humans have led to changes in hospital procedures for premature and boarder babies.


Review/Music; Pushing a Cello to Its Limit
LEAD: One enjoys the driven quality in Ralph Kirshbaum's cello playing for its ability to make tension swell and expand rather than narrow into hardness.
In his concert with Jonathan Feldman at Weill Recital Hall Friday night, Mr.
Kirshbaum pushed tempos hard without ever really rushing them.
The first movement of the Franck


Hungary's Party Compromises on View of Uprising
LEAD: The Communist Party Central Committee today endorsed a compromise to end a leadership dispute over whether the 1956 Hungarian uprising, which was crushed by the Soviet Army, was a popular uprising or a counterrevolution.


Italy's Strikes Are Irritating Even Unions
LEAD: The Iraqi Airways flight was supposed to be nonstop from Baghdad to Rome.
But the plane was barely airborne one day several months ago when a sudden strike by air controllers at the Fiumicino airport outside Rome forced a detour to Cyprus.


Tanglewood Announces 1989 Season
LEAD: The 1989 Tanglewood Music Festival in Lenox, Mass., is scheduled to open on June 30 with a concert by the Boston Symphony Chamber Players at the festival's theater.
The first concert by the full Boston Symphony will follow on July 7 in the shed.


Two Architects Who Tap Into Our Deepest Moods
LEAD: The first pleasure in the Museum of Modern Art's new architecture exhibition, ''Emilio Ambasz/Steven Holl,'' is the extent to which it makes the never-ending debate about style seem tiresome, even trivial.
The work of these architects is too original, and too good, to be bound by stylistic labels.


Linda Buchin Plans to Wed
LEAD: Dr. and Mrs.
Stanley I. Buchin of Boston have announced the engagement of their daughter, Linda Chase Buchin, to Michael Hobart Sullivan, a son of Dr.
Hobart B. Sullivan Jr. of Philadelphia and Maria G. Sullivan of Berwyn, Pa.
An August wedding is planned.


Sharpening Chisels and Planes
LEAD: WOODWORKING chisels and at least one hand plane have a place in almost every household tool kit.
However, if you own such tools, learning how to sharpen them is as important as learning how to use them.
Dull cutting tools are ineffective.
They are also dangerous because they require more effort to use than sharp tools and so are more difficult to control.


Red Baron Wasn't Downed From the Air
LEAD: To the Editor:


Many Donate To Neediest As Memorial
LEAD: A homeless man named Ruben Rodriguez who lived in Hicksville, L.I., was recently killed in a traffic accident.
Carla and Joseph Samodulski, also from Hicksville, sent a donation to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund in Mr.
Rodriguez's memory with the request that it be used ''to help another homeless person.


Clan Consciousness
LEAD: To the Editor:


Star Steals the Show in 'Social Security'
LEAD: IT isn't just that Reizl Bozyk steals the show ''Social Security'' at the Forum Theater as, last summer, she stole the film ''Crossing Delancy.'' Mrs.
Bozyk simply is the show, the whole show, and that's that.


Alternatives To Incineration
LEAD: I would like to clarify some points in ''Opening a New Era in Garbage Disposal''  [ Jan. 15 ] .


Persistent Romantic Pursues a Fantasy
LEAD: I HAVE been married to the same man for more than 40 years, so naturally you would assume that I have become resigned to his no-nonsense ways.
Not so.
I must confess that I have spent years trying to mold him into the Prince Charming of my romantic fantasies.
A case in point is Valentine's Day.

LEAD: A man who Federal officials say is a member of the Irish Republican Army is being held on charges of carrying $13,500 in counterfeit $50 bills at La Guardia Airport, where he was arrested last week.


WESTCHESTER GUIDE
LEAD:  BIOGRAPHICAL BOON  Scholars, students and the public may avail themselves of an unusual collection of 15,000 biographical books recently donated to the Manhattanville College Library in Purchase by Emery Allain of Greenwich.
Mr.
Allain, retired chief financial officer of Great Northern Nekoosa paper company, collected biographies as a hobby.


Shirley Decides She's Had Enough
LEAD: ''Sentimental?
What do you mean sentimental?'' Willy Russell grabs the text of his play ''Shirley Valentine.'' He reads a passage in which Shirley, a working-class Liverpool housewife, is declaring that men cannot talk to women:


Long Island Is Still a Home To Sea Turtles, Scientists Say
LEAD: A sizable population of juvenile sea turtles still calls Long Island home, three scientists reported today.


She's Not Buying
LEAD: Why did Dorothy Huntley-Flint sneak back into the clubhouse on Friday after getting a hole-in-one at a local club at Barton-on-Sea, England?
Because it was her fourth hole-in-one, and she couldn't face another round of congratulations?
Because at the age of 90 she'd had enough excitement in her life?


EVERYONE IS SOMEBODY'S CHILD

New York:  Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. $18.95.


STREETSCAPES: O'Reilly Brothers Warehouse; A Marvel of Fancy Brickwork Awaits the Dawn of a New Day
LEAD: THE O'Reilly Brothers Warehouse is something of a one-note building, but the note is exquisite.
Now vacant and boarded up, the nine-story structure at the northeast corner of 123d Street and St.
Nicholas Avenue is fairly plain, without ornament, but it presents a rich interplay of orange brick and brownstone.


Closing In On 20 Feet
LEAD: In what has come to resemble an intramural display of Soviet air power, Sergei Bubka regained the world indoor pole-vault record yesterday from Rodion Gataullin.


Darman Balances Hard Decisions and Hard Numbers
LEAD: As the final touches were being put on the budget proposals President Bush delivered to Congress Thursday night, a disagreement developed between Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Nicholas F. Brady, the Treasury Secretary.


For Afghans, Bickering and Sadness
LEAD: Not long ago, after the Soviet troops had gone, Mohammad Sadiq went back to the village in Afghanistan where he was born.
The setting bestowed on it by nature and the structures built by men had been reduced to desolation.


New Major in College is Weatherz
LEAD: THE 15 students who signed up for an unadvertised and unofficial meteorology major at Western Connecticut State University last September are apparently already adept at determining which way the wind is blowing.


FICTION
LEAD:  ON OUR OWN BEHALF: Women's Tales From Catalonia.
Edited by Kathleen McNerney. (University of Nebraska, $24.95).
It's probably no great surprise that even a collection of work as specialized as one devoted to contemporary feminist women writers of Catalonia could bring together such characters as a vagabond, a lapsed lesbian and a woman who says her rosary during sex.


Dr. Sheryl Ann Ross Wed To Dr. Mitchell D. Becker
LEAD: Dr.
Sheryl Ann Ross, a resident in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles, and Dr.
Mitchell Douglas Becker, a resident in internal medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center, were married last evening at the Beverly Hills Hotel.


Flimsy Excuses
LEAD: THE SOCK DRAWER was a large drawer to the right of our kitchen sink, just below the knives and forks and next to the junk drawer.
It was my mother's solution to the laundry.
The name was a euphemism, for, although it did house the entire family's abandoned mateless socks, its chief function was to contain the underpants of the female offspring.


Varied Causes, Many Parties
LEAD:  Scholarship Benefit


Pass the Indian Nuts
LEAD: YESTERLINGO IS the fondly remembered language of the recent past.
Nostalgia may not be what it used to be, as Simone Signoret suggested in the title of her autobiography, but the ghost words of our youth haunt us still.


A Senior Becomes a Freshman, And There's a World of Difference
LEAD: MY daughter was for sale last year.
Did I love her?
Yes!
Did I like her?
No!
I didn't know exactly where to place the ad, but ''Help Wanted'' was the area that I deemed to be most appropriate.


Fielding Debits For Strawberry
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Brawley Case Details Sought
LEAD: The New York Daily News asked the State Supreme Court in Manhattan Friday to force a special prosecutor, Charles J. Hynes, to disclose details of his inquiry into the source of a disclosure to The New York Times in the Tawana Brawley case last year.
Mr.
Hynes said in January that he could not establish how The Times obtained summaries of evidence in the case.


Tropical Carnival With Menu to Match
LEAD: DURING the dreariest days of winter, it seems as though half of Long Island is making a beeline for sunny climes.
The other half might find some small compensation at Hempstead's Caribbean Cafe.


Officials Say Utility Will Still Probably Settle
LEAD: Although the Long Island Lighting Company emerged the clear winner in yesterday's Federal court decision, officials said that the utility is still likely to agree to a proposed settlement whose provisions are the same as those it was considering when it faced the possibility of multibillion-dollar damages in the case.


Bush's Bailout Plan
LEAD: On Monday, President Bush announced a plan to bail out the troubled savings and loan industry.
To pay for the plan - which is projected to cost taxpayers about $60 billion - the Government will sell bonds and raise premiums for Federal deposit insurance.
In addition, the Government would take control of 350 troubled savings associations.

A Dinner for Two, Especially for Valentine's Day
LEAD: ON Valentine's Day, it's dinner for two.
Lavishing care and attention on such a mini-feast can be extremely rewarding, perhaps in more ways than one.


Top Teams Sign Area Stars
LEAD: When the list of high school players who signed letters of intent to play football at Division I-A colleges next fall came out last week, it was not surprising to find some of the best New York-area players going to some of the top-rated teams.


Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''I will obey Christ and serve in His name.''  - Bishop Barbara C. Harris.  [ 26:1. ]


Right to Life is Freedom to Choose
LEAD: I BELIEVE in life.
I believe in choice.
I am pro-life and pro-choice.
I see no contradictions in combining the two.
The only problem I see is with the people who use those words, but who do not understand the underlying reality and concept behind them.


Kendo: Rising From a Samurai Tradition
LEAD: ROBED, barefoot figures with faces shielded.
Respectful bowing, advancing and striking.
Shouted expressions of self-mastery and spirit.
All this is part of kendo, the Japanese martial art with roots in the samurai tradition.


Stroessner Leaves Very Little Opposition
LEAD: AS Gen.
Alfredo Stroessner entered his fourth decade in power in 1984, the shadow of Cuba and Nicaragua - countries where rightist caudillos were swept away by Marxist revolutionaries -began to haunt Paraguay.
Since he allowed no room for moderate opposition, it was argued, leftist extremism would inevitably appear here.


A Tale of Two Theaters
LEAD: To the Editor:


The Worm and the Apple; Down by the Station: The M.T.A.'s Tunnel Vision
LEAD: In its zeal to demolish rundown subway newsstands and stores, New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority ignores the se-curity, convenience and life that concessions can provide.
That earns the M.T.A. a big worm.


Real Estate Is Alive and Well
LEAD: Who says real estate has seen the end of ''boom times'' in Fairfield County? (Real Estate Bids Goodbye to Boom Times, Dec. 25).
A few buyers who couldn't ''steal'' a house?
A few sellers who are still on the early spring price kick of 1986?
A few brokers who have to work harder to make and keep sales together?


Rabbi Samarious Gourary, 91, an Educator
LEAD: Rabbi Samarious Gourary, the executive director for the past 48 years of United Lubavitcher Yeshivoth, the educational arm of the Lubavitcher Hasidim, died after a brief illness at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center yesterday.
He was 91 years old and lived in Montclair, N.J.


Theatrical Richness Of the Nonprofit Stage
LEAD: The Jan. 8 article ''Theater in the State: A 'Coming of Age' '' ignores one of the most versatile, diverse theatrical resources in New Jersey: the nonprofit, nonprofessional theater.
In central New Jersey alone, where our organization has existed for more than 35 years, there are more than 15 such theaters, run by volunteer members united in common devotion to an art form.


Among Mayors, a Tide Of Drugs Brings Forth Desperation and Ideas
LEAD: ''ALL we do is meet about the drug problem,'' said Police Chief Maurice T. Turner Jr. of the District of Columbia. ''It's driving the resources of the metropolitan police department.''

Sheldon B. Mermelstein of Bear Creek, Pa.
An April wedding is planned.


Italian Etchers Sing a Siren Song In Boston
LEAD: We tend to describe the course of art history during the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe almost exclusively through paintings, sculpture and architecture, but it was hardly less through the humbler medium of the print that art was experienced at the time.
When King Francis I commissioned an elaborate decorative program for the palace at Fontainebleau from the Bolognese painter Francesco Primaticcio, it was the influence of Parmigianino that could everywhere be felt in the result.

After Lilco: A Future for RICO Against Regulated Industries?
LEAD: A Federal judge's decision yesterday overturning the use of the RICO statute to find the Long Island Lighting Company liable for criminal fraud in a rate-setting case could limit RICO's use against regulated industries, several legal experts believe.


Those Embarrassing Gaps On the President's Team
LEAD: ''I AM fascinated by people who have never been players in the process running around trying to suggest that there is a much better way to do this than the way it's being done,'' said a senior White House official last week, bristling at the suggestion that the Bush Administration's A-team, chosen for its knowledge of how

LEAD: Although on the surface it would appear that more than a third - about 600 - of N.F.L. players will be free to negotiate with any team between Feb. 2 and April 1 in attempts to better their respective situations, the jury will be out for quite some time before the verdict is in as to how well free agency is working.

The couple plan to marry in April.


What Happened to the Architects of Iran's Revolution
LEAD: IT was 10 years ago this weekend that Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, Shah of Shahs, Light of the Aryans, and America's anointed policeman of the Persian Gulf, left Iran, carrying a small jar of his native soil, an aide kissing his head in a last obsequious gesture.
In his place came Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the implacable exponent of a new theocracy of Shiite


Walker Wins One for His Father

John R. Stafford of Essex Fells, N.J.
A June wedding is planned.
Miss Stafford, a screen and television actress, is a graduate of the Pingry School and Northwestern University.


Betting on a Gambit When Time Is Short
LEAD: THERE is nothing so much to be wished for by a player trailing in a short match than a novel gambit to unsettle the opponent and make up the lost ground.
But producing one when you need it is a rare achievement.


Williams Trade Is Still a Rumor
LEAD: Speculation that Buck Williams of the Nets will be traded before the Feb. 23 deadline is continuing this weekend.
The latest rumor has Williams, a 6-foot-8-inch forward, being traded to Portland in exchange for Jerome Kersey and the Trail Blazers' first-round draft pick in 1989.


POSTINGS: 660,000 Sq. Ft. in the 'Village'; Union Quarters
LEAD: New York area carpenters' unions have purchased a former Western Electric building on the western fringe of Greenwich Village for use as a headquarters for their district council and as a center for their pension and benefits office.
The 10-story building at 395 Hudson Street, the blockfront between West Houston and Clarkson


Family-Style American in Darien
LEAD: IF Bugbee &amp; Brownell seems familiar, it's because it is.
The relatively new restaurant, on the Post Road in Darien (next to Friendly's, just off Exit 13 of Interstate 95), is actually the old Harper's and has simply changed its name.
The new name, inspired by an old Boston tea company which has no connection to the restaurant, is meant, in one waitress's words, ''to sound good, as part of our upscaling.


Crop Income Increases For New York Farmers
LEAD: New York farmers grew more apples, tomatoes and pears last year than in 1987 but smaller quantities of sweet corn, cabbage, cherries and onions, according to a series of year-end reports issued by the New York Agricultural Statistics Service here.


SPIES &amp; THRILLERS
LEAD: Diamonds are what Gerald A. Browne knows about, and diamonds are what he writes best about, starting with the spectacular caper he dreamed up for ''11 Harrowhouse'' in 1972.
In his latest book, HOT SIBERIAN (Arbor House/Morrow, $19.95), the subject again is diamonds - but this time Russian diamonds.


Kabul Accuses Pakistan of Planning Invasion; Afghans Take Over Bases
LEAD: As the last Soviet military units in Afghanistan headed home, reports relayed from the front today by Soviet newspapers and television pictured an army that was rolling up like a carpet.


Rhode Island Resident Convicted in Snipings

New York:  Random House. $18.95.


WHAT'S DOING IN: Savannah
LEAD: Unlike some other time-worn towns, Savannah doesn't believe in keeping the family treasures in a display case, to be seen but not touched.
House museums, frequent private tours and friendly homeowners offer a hands-on history lesson.
Laid out by Gen.
James Oglethorpe 256 years ago, Savannah has the country's largest urban National Historic Landmark District, which includes free-standing mansions, row houses on Gordon, Jones and Gaston streets and 22 park-like squares.


Compaq Sharpens Its Video Option
LEAD: Computer-aided design and computer-aided engineering, or CAD-CAE, used to be done almost exclusively on powerful work stations costing tens of thousands of dollars.
Today, most CAD work is done on personal computers, especially on machines that are powered by the Intel 80386 processor.
That chip has enough muscle to display and redraw complex graphics and drawings.


The Secret Life Of Thurber In Paris
LEAD: ''DON'T try it,'' would surely have been James Thurber's advice to me if I'd asked him about picking up his traces in Paris.
A literary man, he had little use for the literary pilgrimage and had dropped few handkerchiefs for the pilgrim on his trail.
But I thought I was entitled to at least try.


Cable Cars
LEAD: To the Editor:


IF YOU'RE THINKING OF LIVING IN: Upper West Side
LEAD: IT is 18 months since Lichtman's bakery closed, 20 since the projector sputtered to a halt at the Thalia theater and nearly four years since the New Yorker bookshop shut down - all victims of creeping development and galloping rent rises.


Intrepid Director Goes in Search Of Adventure
LEAD: Under a withering African sun that scorches the pale green acacia trees and tawny earth in the Ngong Hills not far from here, Bob Rafelson, a multicolored wool cap protecting his head, is directing two actors dressed in tattered Victorian garb.
One is on crutches; the other appears quite spry.
Both are sweltering in heavy coats and gaiters as they say farewell to each other.


Pretoria Medical Policy Faulted in Detainee Death
LEAD: A long investigation into the death in detention of a black youth leader two years ago has again pointed up the lack of medical attention given political detainees.


There Are Divisions, Iranian Concedes
LEAD: Iran's President today publicly recognized the existence of divisions among Iranian leaders, but asserted that the nation remains committed to the ''revolutionary ideas'' that marked the birth of the Islamic revolution 10 years ago.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. I have a stall shower that has tiled walls up to the painted ceiling.
Every two or three years this paint peels and flakes and we have to repaint.
Is there a special paint I can use?


Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Bid to Stay Ahead
LEAD: George J. Feeney, the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation's senior vice president for advanced development, leaned across the table in his utilitarian Manhattan office and talked about, of all things, oil.


ANJELICA RISING: Stardom for Another Huston
LEAD: ANJELICA HUSTON PAUSED AND STUDIED a charcoal drawing of a woman in profile.
The scene was the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the 37-year-old actress was taking an afternoon off from working on Woody Allen's latest movie to see the Degas show.
The drawing was of a handsome, dark-haired, strong-featured woman with a long, aristocratic nose.


In Sweat Suits and Jogging Shoes, Walkers Are Taking to Malls
LEAD: IF you go to the mall only to shop, chances are you have never seen them.
They are there at dawn, hours before the first cash register rings, often before the first janitorial shift.
Clad in sweat suits and jogging shoes, they come to walk the store-lined corridors, back and forth, over and over.
They are mall walkers, and for them, the suburban shopping mall, with its controlled climate, security guards, level floors and restrooms, is the perfect exercise track.


Rescuing A Turtle, Reviving Nature's Balance
LEAD: AS I followed the Alley Pond Park nature trail that February morning, evidence of the last snowstorm was practically gone, save for traces under the thicker underbrush.
The ice of the stream melted into a still pond of brownish water topped with a few floating leaves.


Taking the Guilt Out of Sweets
LEAD: MANY people like sugar, but too many people feel guilty about consuming it, the Sugar Association believes.


Review/Dance; A Respect For Earth And Life
LEAD: Choreographic modesty was one of the virtues of Shelley Lee's ''Maize'' Thursday night at the Merce Cunningham Studio, but it was responsible for some bland sequences in the hourlong work offered by Shelley Lee and Dancers.


New York Shuts 2 Gay Theaters As AIDS Threats
LEAD: New York City health officials closed two gay theaters in Manhattan last week in an effort to halt the spread of AIDS.

Chris Mullin: Grown Up, And an All-Star At Last
LEAD: The moves - the stutter steps, fakes and jukes that leave defenders leaning the wrong way - have become so refined that they often go unnoticed.
But Chris Mullin has not gone unnoticed.
He has been recognized as an All-Star for the first time in his four-year pro career.


Air Pressure
LEAD: To the Editor:


NONFICTION
LEAD:  AMERICA.
By Jean Baudrillard.
Translated by Chris Turner. (Verso, $24.95.) Tourists, beware.
Although the French philosopher Jean Baudrillard has drawn inspiration from his travels around the United States, and has included verbal snapshots of New York City and Los Angeles, Monument Valley and Salt Lake City, his illustrated book contains little in the way of travel writing - that is, the sights, sounds and textures of daily life.


A Dinner for Two, Especially for Valentine's Day
LEAD: ON Valentine's Day, it's dinner for two.
Lavishing care and attention on such a mini-feast can be extremely rewarding, perhaps in more ways than one.


COACH UNDER FIRE
LEAD: When it comes to the relationship between athletics and academics, there may be a lot of hypocrisy on the nation's college campuses, but apparently not at Prairie View A&amp;M.
If some of his players are telling it right, Haney Catchings, the football coach at the Texas school, makes no pretense about being anything but strictly an athletics man.


WHERE SHOULD BABY SLEEP?
LEAD: Excuse me, but the last time I checked, I was living in New Jersey and there wasn't a !Kung village in sight (Body and Mind: ''Where Should Baby Sleep?'' by Melvin Konner, Jan. 8).
Dr.
Konner's article indulges in a cross-cultural romanticism that I, as a parent, am tired of.
Sleep with your children until they leave home, if that's what pleases you.


Review/Music; New Voice in Met's 'Castle'
LEAD: Jessye Norman took half the night off at the Metropolitan Opera on Wednesday, relinquishing the role of Judith in Bartok's ''Bluebeard's Castle'' but appearing as usual in ''Erwartung,'' the Schoenberg monodrama that fills out this new double bill.


St. John's University Appoints New President
LEAD: The president of Niagara University, the Very Rev.
Donald J. Harrington, was chosen last week to be the next president of St.
John's University.
He will succeed the Very Rev.
Joseph T. Cahill, who is completing almost 25 years as president of St.
John's.


From Minos To Motorbikes In Crete
LEAD: HOMER referred to it as a ''land of 90 cities,'' but Crete today is an island of hundreds of villages and small towns.
Of its fabled ''90 cities,'' only three remain, all on the north coast: Iraklion, the modern capital, a busy port city, sophisticated and self-conscious; Chania, to the west, in the shadows of the White Mountains overlooking Souda Bay, and between them, on a spit of rock that curves out into the Sea of Crete, Rethymnon, smaller and poorer than the others, but fiercely spirited, perhaps the best reflection of the complex mixture of past and present that is modern


Auto Insurance Is Daunting Issue for Jersey Rivals
LEAD: As the race for governor heats up, candidates are beginning to confront the high cost of automobile insurance, an issue that infuriates almost everyone in New Jersey and is understood by practically no one.


Ojai, Calif.
LEAD: To the Editor: Milena Jovanovitch (''California's Tranquil Ojai Valley,'' Travel, Nov. 6) has fulfilled one of my fondest dreams, that of returning to my former home.
In such fully detailed descriptions did she so aptly convey the soul of the Ojai Valley that I was permitted once again to savor the experience of that wonderful place.


Who Can Be Made to Pay For Another's Violence?
LEAD: IN recent years, some courts have ruled that psychotherapists and other professionals may be legally responsible for crimes committed by people in their care.
Now a lawsuit is testing whether the parents of an emotionally unstable adult can be held to a similar standard.


Margaret M. Byrne to Marry Frank P. Christian 3d
LEAD: Margaret Mary Byrne and Frank Philip Christian 3d plan to be married April 1.
The couple's parents are Mr. and Mrs.
Terence C. Byrne of Hackettstown, N.J., and Mr. and Mrs.
Christian 2d of Clarks Summit, Pa.


Miss Toffey to Wed James Mauro in May
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
John J. Toffey 4th of Great Barrington, Mass., have made known the engagement of their daughter, Hannah Toffey, to James Christopher Mauro, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
James H. Mauro of Massapequa, L.I.
A May wedding is planned.


Philosophy Provides the Key to a Pianist
LEAD: ''When I was young,'' the pianist Russell Sherman said, ''I came across a statement made by Jung, who said that it is the function of an artist is to rectify the imbalances of the period in which he happens to live.

The Pace of Automation Increases
LEAD: WHENEVER camera journalists get together, there's always one wag in the group who remarks, ''Well, the next thing you know, they'll make a camera that automatically composes the picture for you.'' I used to think this was a joke.
Welcome, friends, to the brave new world of the ''automatic programmed zoom composing system.


The Bush Budget: Promises to Keep, Messes to Mop Up
LEAD: FEDERAL budgets are pies of taxpayer money that the President and Congress slice up and pass around to aircraft builders, disabled miners, urban transit authorities and, directly or indirectly, to virtually all the other participants in the economy.
Usually the pie grew from year to year, so that even less favored sectors and constituencies could get a little more than before.

Abreast of Telecommunication's Change
LEAD: BACK when ''the telephone company'' was the only game in town, corporate managers simply called the American Telephone and Telegraph Company when they had problems with their telecommunications.

NONFICTION
LEAD:  SUSAN B. ANTHONY: A Biography of a Singular Feminist.
By Kathleen Barry. (New York University, $27.95.) Those who dimly recall Susan B. Anthony as Tonto to Elizabeth Cady Stanton's Lone Ranger will be surprised, and perhaps provoked, to read in ''Susan B.

Impressionism Revisited: Context Is King
LEAD: During the last 15 to 20 years, art historians like Robert L. Herbert have changed art history.

Anne Alexander Is Engaged
LEAD: Mrs.
Chester Alexander of Gloucester, Va., has made known the engagement of her daughter, Anne Stokes Alexander, to Davis Ratcliffe Marshall, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Hunting for Bargains in Insurance
LEAD: Most consumers think nothing of conducting an exhaustive time-consuming search for the best deal on such items as a compact disk player or an air conditioner.

That's a different matter. ''Insurance is about negative, troubling ideas, like your house burning down, your car being stolen or someone dying; no one wants to face it,'' said Kevin Foley, Deputy Superintendent of the New York State Insurance Department.


'Enlightened Approach' To Land Use
LEAD: Many thanks to the developer Karl Kehde and the Ohly family for their enlightened approach to land use (''Home Plan Saves Land for Refuge,'' Jan. 15).

Towns Are Adding Required Recycling
LEAD: WHEN she heard her town was setting up mandatory recycling, Carlene E. Kulisch, the head of the Branford Condominium Association, thought it would be difficult to separate her trash.
After a few weeks of putting aside cans, bottles and newspapers, Ms.
Kulisch said that although the task was not so difficult, the recycling program will not be universally liked when it is fully instituted next month.


Alcohol Is a Problem When It's a Problem
LEAD: BY what standards should society judge whether someone is a problem drinker?

LEAD: Although it is officially banned, trekking across the ice bridge that forms at the base of the Horseshoe Falls in frigid weather is a thrill that some people compare to going over the falls in a barrel.


Deficit Figuring Doesn't Add Up
LEAD: In the few months since George Bush's election, there has been a remarkable swing of sentiment on the Federal budget deficit.
In November, a sharp drop in the financial markets was regarded by some as signaling a deficit ''crisis.'' Former and present Federal Reserve Chairmen Paul A. Volcker and Alan Greenspan, former Presidents Gerald R.


A NEW PILL, A FIERCE BATTLE
LEAD: WITH HIS MOP OF black hair and his brown ankle-high boots, Dr.
Etienne-Emile Baulieu comes across at once as a different kind of scientist.
His breezy, almost brash manner and hyperkinetic nature give him the air more of a populist politician than of a meticulous medical researcher, an expert in hormones at France's National Institute of Health and Medical


Walking Tall Into Manhattan
LEAD: ENCOURAGED, perhaps, by the New Jerseyans who commute to Manhattan, three of the state's museums are visiting there.
To be precise, the Montclair Art Museum, the Newark Museum and the State Museum in Trenton, have sent samplings of their permanent collections to the International Business Machines Corporation's Gallery of Science and Art, 590 Madison Avenue, at 56th

The daughter is headed for a promising career in museum work and at the same time has announced her engagement.

Celebration For a Famous Cent
LEAD: IF ever a coin could be called endearing, the Lincoln cent earns the title hands down.
Celebrating its 80th year, more than a quarter-trillion of the coins have been minted.

Designing A Jewelry Jungle
LEAD: MIA FONSSAGRIVES-SOLOW, right, was in the fashion business with the designer Vicky Tiel in Paris in the 1960's.
When she returned to the United States she became a sculptor, making larger-than-life-size animals.
Recently she has interpreted animal shapes as jewelry, including walking cats, swinging monkeys, butterflies with folded wings, lions' heads and standing meerkats (African mongooses).


The All-Stars Predict Entertainment Aplenty
LEAD: Someone asked Charles Barkley if the National Basketball Association All-Star Game Sunday would be entertaining even though Magic Johnson and Larry Bird would not be playing, because of injuries.
When Barkley heard the question, his face twisted into a menacing grimace, the type of look he usually saves for referees after they whistle a foul on him.


Review/Rock; Gatton Visits, With Guitar
LEAD: Very few things sound as archetypically American as the sound of a Fender Telecaster guitar abusing a Fender amplifier into hysterics.
It's the sound of early rock, of harsh metallic blues, of the new music that changed the sound of American pop in the 1950's.


Seton Hall Tops Villanova, 83-77

LEAD: LAST January, after years of happy commuting on Metro-North, I traded my timetable and train buddies for a job in Westchester that required that I drive.


To U.S., Afghanistan Seems to Move Farther Away
LEAD: FOR the United States, the word Afghanistan once evoked obscurity.
One of the world's most isolated countries, it has no railways, no navigable rivers, no outlet to the sea, few natural resources and a history notable primarily for its turbulence.
Before the Soviet occupation nine years ago, the United States imported little more than sheepskins and carpets from Afghanistan in exchange for

FOCUS: Cumberland, Me.; Maine's Coastal Estates Are Now Hot Properties
LEAD: When residents of this affluent suburb of Portland voted in December not to buy the 25-acre estate known as Conifer Ledges, they confirmed what many here have felt for some time: Oceanfront property has become too expensive for public agencies.
The estate would have given the community its only waterfront park.


NEW YORKERS, Etc.
LEAD: IT'S difficult to believe, but there are people who don't talk to themselves.
They think the things that many others say aloud, they form sentences and phrases in their minds, and occasionally they go so far as to move their lips - but no sound emerges.
In fact, these people are apt to consider those who do talk to themselves a rather strange lot, next door to street mutterers and just a few degrees away from the men and women who carry on loud and rambling conversations with phantoms on buses and subways.


Winter Relaxes Its Grip, a Bit


POSTINGS: New Crop, Old Acres; Farmland Project
LEAD: A 26-acre tract in central New Jersey that had been farmed for more than a century and that still retains an 1832 farmhouse is being developed into a 76-unit complex of town houses and apartments.

Question Of the Week; Will Free Agency Work In Football?
LEAD: The free agency will do to football what it did to baseball: It will make millionaires out of mediocre players.
Big-city teams with big-city budgets will become a collection of overpriced underachievers.
Owners will be tried and found guilty of collusion in an effort to stop the bidding madness.
And the fans will enjoy it all from their $500 seats, while waving their $25 programs, eating their $15 hotdogs, and sipping their $5 sodas.


Karen Brandt and Kenan Onel, Students, to Wed
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Mr. and Mrs.

Mr. Bush's Bacon
LEAD: What are America's most pressing domestic needs?
In his new budget, President Bush lays out these answers: (1) to increase productivity; (2) to invest in people; and (3) to end the scourge of drugs.
Admirable.
Many Americans share these goals.
But there's a problem.
Though the captain's new chart plots a sensible destination, his boat is too small to get there.


In Remaking Itself, Texas Hasn't Lost Its Myths and Memory
LEAD: IN 1981, Larry McMurtry wrote an essay for the Texas Observer that set off furious howls throughout Texas.
Mr.
McMurtry virtually dismissed all of Texas literature, saying Texas writers were unduly fixated on the past and largely because of that had produced almost nothing of lasting value.
He lamented that he had been far too optimistic when he predicted 14 years earlier the demise of literature extolling the rural glories of wide-open spaces and yahoos on horseback.

'Reformed' Man Back in Jail
LEAD: SEVENTEEN years after fleeing a prison in Louisiana, where he had begun serving 15 years for manslaughter, Henry Staggs was recaptured in Columbia, Tenn., apparently a changed man.

Review/Dance; Richard Biles's Many Modes
LEAD: Richard Biles enterprisingly choreographed big works and little, solos and ensembles, for the program his Richard Biles Dance Company presented Friday night at the Nikolais/Louis Choreospace.
But only a few of those dances were theatrically effective.


Reviews/Music; Solti With the Chicago And More Shostakovich
LEAD: Periodically, the guardians of our New York concert life make earnest noises about trying to coordinate their programming.

WHEN OLD IS NEW
LEAD: In this era of eternal youth, speeding up the aging process may seem like a strange idea, but it has become big business in the design world.
It is now possible to get the feeling of perfectly faded fabrics or the rich patina of century-old woods without paying the price of time.
The tricks, to be sure, are theatrical: soaking freshly printed chintzes in vats of tea; smearing mud into shiny surfaces; mixing eggshells, finely ground dust or coffee grinds into paint; beating fabrics with stones.


Israel Against Itself
LEAD: ''Mr.
Prime Minister, to achieve order in the casbah I have to act brutally toward people free of crime, too.
I feel humiliated by this behavior.
The situation has become a catastrophe.
It's breaking us and strengthening the Arabs.'' - - Israeli soldier, when Prime Minister Shamir visited troops in the West Bank city of Nablus last month.

LEAD: DURING most of the year, the door to the Connecticut Afro-American Historical Society is locked, and entrance is by appointment only.

A Call for Persistence
LEAD: With Workfare I read with interest the article ''Few Show Up for Workfare Jobs''  [ Jan. 29 ] .

Review/Theater; Three Little Ghouls From School
LEAD: When we first meet Jana, Jena and Jinna Gimmel, the identical triplets who reek mischief in Jeffrey Essmann's madcap comedy ''Triplets in Uniform,'' the scene is Prussia and the year 1919.
The simpering adolescent trio has just returned for another semester to the forbidding Kaiserina Wilhelmina School for Girls, whose stern headmistress, Frau Fotze, has an inexplicable phobia about mirrors.


Reuse of Old Buildings Deserves Consideration
LEAD: The new use of old historic buildings is a wonderful idea.
It allows people to enjoy the beauty of architectural landmarks in different and creative ways.
In the article ''Stamford's Old Town Hall May Have a Future in Art'' (Jan. 22), where the proposal to convert a virtually empty landmark edifice into a museum is discussed, is a plan which deserves serious consideration.

Adultery Penalty May Change
LEAD: The State House of Representatives has passed a bill repealing a 200-year-old law that makes adultery a crime punishable by a year in jail.
The measure, passed 201 to 149 on Thursday, goes to the Senate, where a similar bill was defeated two years ago.

Norwegian Surprises, From Opera to Symphony
LEAD: The composer Christian Sinding (1856-1941) is remembered for one of music's great chestnuts, ''Rustle of Spring,'' which brought his name into many a genteel parlor in Europe and the Americas.

Sharpening Chisels and Planes
LEAD: WOODWORKING chisels and at least one hand plane have a place in almost every household tool kit.
However, if you own such tools, learning how to sharpen them is as important as learning how to use them.
Dull cutting tools are ineffective.
They are also dangerous because they require more effort to use than sharp tools and so are more difficult to control.


A Greece of Forests And Mountain Lakes
LEAD: FOR years, my vision of Greece consisted exclusively of naked, sun-scorched rock and pristine sugar-cube villages rising out of an expanse of blue sea.
Then, gradually, I became drawn to another, more subtle Greece, not Mediterranean but Balkan; an autumnal land of fir forests, stately poplars and dark green mountains grooved with snow, evoking the background of an old master's painting rather than the usual watercolor sketch of sea and stone.

Among them are seven songs in the long-running ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' and five in the recently opened ''Black and Blue'' - including the title songs.

Thursday's Child Sails In, Sets Mark

Tiny Statue, Major Mess and Much at Stake
LEAD: A $3 million disagreement, the reputation of a major Renaissance scholar and the disputed activities of a varied cast of characters, including a Paris art collector, a Dutch dealer once convicted of fraud and a major auction house: all are elements in the tangle surrounding an eight-inch plaster statue declared two years ago to be a long-lost work by Michelangelo.


Government by Black Boxes
LEAD: Has Congress abdicated too much responsibility to special blue-ribbon commissions?
Have elected officials become addicted to extra-constitutional devices that shield them from tough choices?

It was at Xavier High School in Manhattan.
Another report in the column, about the Fordham basketball team, misidentified the coach.

LEAD: Union Carbide will pay $470 million in damages for the 1984 gas leak disaster in Bhopal, India, that killed more than 3,500 people and injured 200,000.
The payments were ordered by the Indian Supreme Court, and Robert D. Kennedy, Union Carbide's chairman, said the company would accept the order.
The Indian Government also accepted the settlement, even though it had sought $3.3 billion for 500,000 claimants.


Tiny Miracles Become Huge Public Health Problem
LEAD: A newborn boy, a mere patch of flesh with a tangerine-sized head and limbs like splinters, lay tethered to a thicket of tubes on a heated table in a special ward for premature infants at New York Hospital.


Ordeal on I-80
LEAD: WE'RE GOING TO hit,'' I called out to my two sons and my wife, Ann, once it became apparent that control of our station wagon was no longer in my hands but was governed instead by the transparent sheet of ice that had formed on Interstate 80 two miles from our exit.
It would turn out to be our good fortune that we slammed into the concrete wall of the bridge on which we came to a rest rather than being in the left lane, where I had tried to maneuver the car as it slid a good 10 to 12 car lengths.


The No Generation: A Modern Glossary
LEAD: WHEN the Me Generation came along, I knew instinctively that it would affect primarily Them, and when the Now Generation was announced, I was still working on the day before yesterday.
With the onset of the No Generation, I am hopelessly out of touch.
It appears we are living in a society whose parameters are defined by negatives, bringing out the worst in us all.


Regan Fees Paid by Campaign and State
LEAD: New York's State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, is spending up to $400,000 in state funds and campaign money for lawyers as a result of investigations of his campaign financing practices by the State Commission on Government Integrity and Federal and state prosecutors.


Times Square: Lurching Toward a Terrible Mistake?
LEAD: The news these days is full of references to Times Square, and a lot of them seem contradictory.
There are reports that the massive city-state renewal project at the corner of 42d Street and Broadway - a project that was announced in 1981 but which after eight years has yet to begin construction - is about to get a major boost with the decision of one of the city's biggest banks to relocate its headquarters in the project.


Atomic Plant in Pennsylvania Wins Good Marks From U.S.
LEAD: The Philadelphia Electric Company's long-idled Peach Bottom nuclear power plant in central Pennsylvania could be restarted in April if no more serious problems are uncovered, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Friday.


Salvador At a Crossroads
LEAD: One thing Marxist rebels and the far right in El Salvador agree on is that U.S. policy in Central America is a resounding failure.
Of course they have opposite reasons.


Light on the Subject
LEAD: ORDINARILY, this is the time of year when I would be writing about how to adjust your exposure when photographing snow or how to carry your camera while cross-country skiing.
But the weather has conspired against these topics.


SMALL TOTS, BIG BIZ
LEAD: I never cease to be amazed at my generation (''Small Tots, Big Biz,'' by Tamar Lewin, Jan. 29).
The same parents who will pursue any avenue during pregnancy to assure a ''perfect'' baby will readily institutionalize that same baby during its most vulnerable developmental period.


3d in Row for St. Peter's
LEAD: Willie Haynes hit a 16-foot jumper with 11 seconds to play tonight to give St.

Collectively, it was another home victory for the Knicks as they easily defeated the injury-riddled Nets, 125-115, to run their Madison Square Garden winning streak to 18 in a row.


A Question of Whether to Go to Work? Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow
LEAD: THESE questionable winter mornings are for the birds.
The world outside looks black and white but whether or not to venture out is anything but.


Review/Dance; A Soloist of Many Moods Astonishes Even Herself
LEAD: What's she doing now?
Whatever will she do next?
Ellen Cornfield raised such questions in two quirky solos she presented as part of a program of dances and video works on Thursday night at the Dia Art Foundation.


No Headline
LEAD: It is only poetic justice that Nina Wolff (''Sneezing Beauty in a Raccoon Coat,'' Jan. 29) should have to suffer physical discomfort from wearing her new garment.
After all, many innocent animals had to suffer the tortures of the damned to satisfy her desire for glamour and status.


Trail Blazers Dismiss Coach
LEAD: The Portland Trail Blazers dismissed Coach Mike Schuler today and replaced him on an interim basis with an assistant coach, Rick Adelman.
Schuler, 48 years old, was named the National Basketball Association's coach of the year in his first season at Portland, in 1986-87, when the Blazers had a 49-33 record.


THE REGION: The Polls Agree; As Koch Talks Like An Underdog, Dinkins Takes Him Up On It
LEAD: RE-ELECTED by the largest margin in New York City history the last time his job was at stake, Mayor Edward I. Koch now says he regards himself as an underdog.
Is the Mayor being honest, or merely modest?
Can David N. Dinkins thwart Mr.
Koch's attempt to secure an unprecedented fourth term, and in the process become the city's first black mayor?


This Collection Is Entirely Possible
LEAD: AN entire collection of United States ''entires'' probably does not exist.
But this certainly does not prevent a hobbyist from trying to build - who knows - what might become the first such collection.


COUTURE REPORT: SEXY CHIC
LEAD: Word has been wafting through the perfumed Paris air that Yves Saint Laurent is up to something big.
Now, here it is, show time on the next-to-last day of the spring 1989 Paris couture collections.
In the ornate velvet and red gilded ballroom that Saint Laurent traditionally uses to present his season's oeuvres, a runway stretches beneath the low-hanging chandeliers from a stage smothered with red and purple bougainvillea.


POP/JAZZ
LEAD:  Tone Loc: 'Wild Thing'  Delicious Vinyl/Island, 12-inch single.
A massive dance club hit, ''Wild Thing,'' which has a silly rap about seduction, mixes the glittering, silvery sound of club music, a little grinding rock-and-roll and hip-hop.
Tone Loc (Tony Smith) is part of a blossoming Los Angeles hip-hop scene, and his rap has a nice sort of amble to it.


Correction
LEAD: Because of a distributor's change, an article on page 17 of Arts and Leisure today about the film ''Rachel River'' misidentifies the theater.
It is at the Gemini.


GUERRILLAS CHOOSE AN INTERIM REGIME FOR AFGHANISTAN

LEAD: JUST 50 years ago, almost every Catholic church in Italy had an area set aside on one of its interior walls for displaying ex votos, small flat silver figures giving visible testimony of the initiation or fulfillment of a believer's vow (voto).


HIGHER EDUCATION-THE REAL CRISIS
LEAD: Ten years ago, I received a Ph.D. in Engineering, and have been working in industry, primarily because there have been few faculty openings available.
Demographics show that we will have a shortage of faculty in the 1990's; however, I believe there is a relatively simple solution to the problem.

The couple plan to marry in June.


Computers Are Starting to Seem More Like Living Things
LEAD: IN her recent book ''AIDS and Its Metaphors,'' Susan Sontag reflects on how the sudden emergence of computer viruses evokes many of modern society's most primal fears.
Just as AIDS has unnerved people by conjuring up earlier visions of human plagues, she suggests, the advent of the computer virus is undermining the public's faith in the information revolution and changing the way people think about computers, as organisms rather than machines.


Albert McFall Jr. Is Wed To Marie-Louise Gifford
LEAD: At St.
Andrew's Episcopal Church in Madison, Conn., Marie-Louise Conyngham Gifford, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Richard Cammann Gifford of Madison, was married yesterday to Albert Dodge McFall Jr., the son of Mrs.

POSTINGS: Theater Conversion; Chico, Harpo, Groucho, Condo
LEAD: The 80-year-old RKO Keith's Prospect Theater in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, where many actors and vaudevillians started their careers, is itself taking on a new role.
The 500-seat theater, which once featured the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, Burns and Allen and other stars of pre-electronic entertainment, is being converted with an existing supermarket into the 19-unit Park Plaza Condominium.


Life as a Program on a Cosmic Machine
LEAD: AT the same time that computer scientists are thinking of their machines as organisms, biologists are thinking of organisms as though they were computers.
In fact, some physicists have come to believe that the universe itself is a kind of giant calculating machine.

LEAD: The marriage of Heidi Ruth Pfluger, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Core Curriculum: Other Opinions
LEAD: The article on Fairleigh Dickinson's core curriculum that appeared Jan. 22 suggests that Dr.
Robert Donaldson, the president of the university, believes that undergraduates ''should be exposed to the world beyond themselves.'' Therefore, as the article illustrates, those whose vocational goals might be science or engineering are required to take a program of liberal arts.


Spain
LEAD: To the Editor: It would be a pity if the negative comments about Spanish paradors were to cause anyone to pass up one of the great travel experiences of Europe.
In more than 80 locations in all parts of Spain, these inns offer an opportunity to relive history amid charming and often spectacular settings.


Question Of the Week; Can The Yanks Use Guidry And John?
LEAD: I don't believe Tommy John can help the Yanks.

CLASSICAL
LEAD:  Nielsen's Fourth (''Inextinguishable'') and Fifth Symphonies  San Francisco Symphony, conducted by Herbert Blomstedt.
London 421 524, CD and cassette.


Wastebaskekt Ball, Anyone?
LEAD: EVER since I read that five or six games - Ping-Pong for one - had been added to the long list of sporting events included at the Summer Olympics in Seoul, I've been wondering how I could promote one of the most popular but least recognized games for inclusion in the 1992 games in Barcelona.
That sport is wastebasket ball, the game we all play in the home, at work, in the classroom or wherever there is a wastebasket.

Miss Wylegala is an associate producer in New York with GTG/East, the producer of ''USA Today on TV,'' a nationally syndicated program.


Paying the Price
LEAD: Britain's track and field team did not do very well at the 1988 Summer Olympics, and the poor showing is going to be costly.

LEAD: Scott Haffner scored 65 points - tied for sixth-most in a Division I game -and led Evansville past Dayton, 109-83, in a Midwestern Collegiate Conference game today.


Madrid
LEAD: To the Editor: As a frequent business traveler to Spain, not successful or pretentious enough to stay at the Ritz, I can attest in response to R. Pujol's letter (''Madrid,'' Travel, Jan. 8) that I have never been robbed in a hotel in Madrid.
I have stayed at the Miguel Angel, the Emperatriz and the Palace.

LEAD:  WASHINGTON SEMINAR


Review/Music; Wringing Melody From Percussive Sound
LEAD: Chunk, the three-man band that played its debut set Tuesday at the Knitting Factory, could only exist in the 1980's, when almost any sound imaginable is just a digital formula away.
Samm Bennett, David Simons and Kent Spelios of Chunk are all percussionists, but by using electronic percussion consoles that produced various sounds, a few visible instruments (rattles, cymbals, steel guitar, jew's-harp), prerecorded rhythms and Mr.


FICTION
LEAD:  SERIOUS LIVING.
By Tom Lorenz. (Viking, $17.95.) Tom Lorenz, the author of the highly praised 1980 novel ''Guys Like Us,'' has returned to print with a rewarding coming-of-age story set in Chicago. ''Serious Living'' is the comic but also poignant tale of 21-year-old Ritchie Kohler, high school graduate and truly ordinary guy.


HIGHER EDUCATION-THE REAL CRISIS
LEAD: In his article ''Higher Education - The Real Crisis,'' (Jan. 22), Michael I. Sovern mentions the coming retirement (in the 1990's) of many great teachers and also the so-called ''lost generation'' of scholars, of whom I (Ph.D. in English, Princeton University, 1976) am one.
I have never found university work.

LEAD: Richard Arregui parked his car at an art gallery in Miami one day late last year and noticed something different.
An 8-foot aluminum outdoor sculpture was now only 4 feet high.


NONFICTION
LEAD:  WRITERS ON ARTISTS.
Edited by Daniel Halpern. (North Point Press, $25.) Proust on Chardin, Sartre on Tintoretto, Huxley on El Greco, Hemingway on Miro - writers discussing painters hold the irresistible promise of insight beyond formal analysis, interpretation beyond conventional art history.
But writers commenting on painting is tricky business: they risk turning visual images into words, replacing the art under study with their own.


Good Reading On Plants and Design
LEAD: LAST call to go over seed and nursery catalogues and mail orders for woody plants, perennials, groundcovers and seeds.
Prune mature grapevines, fruit trees, large shade trees, overgrown shrubs and hedges.

New Careers For Defense Workers


Customs
LEAD: To the Editor: I read with interest the lament of Sandra Maury (Letters, Nov. 13) about the lack of knowledge among customs agents regarding duty exemptions.
My experience was similar to hers.
I came through customs on Oct. 18, 1988, in San Francisco.
I, too, bought items that were handmade works of art that I fully believed to be (and previously were) exempt from duty.


AIDS Spreading Into Border Areas of Angola
LEAD: On a recent morning near the airport here, Cuban soldiers filed into a military medical center, rolled up their sleeves and gave blood for tests for the AIDS virus.

The Town That Wants What The Others Don't
LEAD: THE announcement that a 25-acre site in Montville would be used as a landfill for ash waste from a trash-to-energy incinerator closely followed a decision by the state to build a prison there and the start of construction of a huge coal-burning electric generating plant by a private company.


Beirut Christians Strive to Avert a Showdown in the Military

Thomas H. Kean and the state's Education Commissioner announced this week.


THE WORLD - Q &amp; A: Liu Binyan; The Party's Loss of Control Is a Chinese Dissident's Gain
LEAD: THE status of human rights is not likely to be high on the agenda during President Bush's scheduled visit to China next weekend.
Indeed, few Americans can name the Chinese counterparts of Andrei D. Sakharov, Natan Sharansky and Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn.
If they could, they might think of Liu Binyan, with little doubt


Images of Coney Island Coming to the Whitney
LEAD: ''Coney Island of the Mind: Images of Coney Island in Art and Popular Culture 1890-1960'' will be at the Whitney Museum of American Art, downtown, at Federal Reserve Plaza, from Wednesday through April 21.
The work of painters and photographers like Joseph Stella, Margaret Bourke-White and Diane Arbus is to be included among the approximately 90 paintings, drawings, prints and photographs.


Political Memo; Seeking Reasons Besides Dukakis, Democrats Mull Last Fall's Defeat
LEAD: While most Americans have happily forgotten about the 1988 election campaign, Democrats are quietly fighting the war of interpretations.
Since election results, like scripture, can be cited to many purposes, Democrats sifting through the returns are coming up with some very different views about what ails the party.


TALKING: Inspectors; Checking A Home For Flaws
LEAD: EVALUATING the qualifications of a home inspector has never been easy.
And it may become even more difficult in the coming months as professional and trade groups battle over who is more competent to make inspections.


THE 'WALKURE' FACEOFF
LEAD: Like Deutsche Grammophon, EMI has begun its new digitally recorded ''Ring des Nibelungen'' with ''Die Walkure.'' The EMI version, conducted by Bernard Haitink, features Eva Marton, Cheryl Studer, James Morris, Reiner Goldberg, Matti Salminen, Waltraud Meier and the Bavarian Radio Symphony (EMI CDS 7 49534; four CD's and LP's three cassettes).


Travel Jitters
LEAD: To the Editor: ''Take it Easy!
You're Going on Vacation'' by John Brannon Albright (Practical Traveler, Jan. 15) reminded me of some of the ways my husband and I relieve our travel jitters.


Supporting Mediocrity Is Not the Solution
LEAD: As a product of the West Hartford and Fairfield school systems, a current university student and a prospective teacher, I found Jacqueline Weaver's interview with Gail Mellow, director of the Connecticut Project for Equal Education Rights, to be interesting and pertinent (Connecticut Q&amp;A, Jan. 1).

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. My wife and I recently bought a 63-year-old house and we are planning a number of renovations.
The heating system is covered with asbestos, so we have done some air quality tests.

New Jersey Q &amp; A: Carol Botwin; Trying to Cope With Male Infidelity
LEAD: CAROL BOTWIN, a co-founder and co-director of the Westfield-based Better Relationship Training Institute, is the author of ''Men Who Can't Be Faithful.'' In the book - as in her earlier works like ''Is There Sex After Marriage?'' - she writes about relationships between men and women.


DEVISL LOSE A 3-1 LEAD
LEAD: Vince Damphousse's two third-period goals rallied Toronto and Mark Osborne scored the winner on a power play as the Maple Leafs defeated the New Jersey Devils, 5-3, tonight.


In the Heart ofIstanbul
LEAD: IF you order tea in one of the Ramada Istanbul's several spacious restaurants, you will notice pink tulips on the cups and saucers - for the handsome new cream hotel, combining modern atriums with beautiful Turkish design, is at the center of the Laleli district, and lale is Turkish for tulip.
As with tulips (said to have arrived in the Netherlands from Turkey), life in Laleli is always a treat for the eye.


Colt Drops Suit Against Los Angeles Weapon Ban
LEAD: Colt Industries has dropped its Federal lawsuit against the city's new ordinance banning possession and sale of semiautomatic assault weapons, the city attorney said Friday.


Bleak, Stubborn Life of the Marsh
LEAD: THERE is plenty of ocean south of Long Island, but there are closer, more intimate seas in our marshes; seas of reeds, penetrated by tidal creeks whose vistas coil through acres of spartina grass and giant phragmites in paths hidden from casual observers, but open to explorers in canoe, johnboat or sneak box.


RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Tennis  Becker Beats McEnroe: Top-seeded Boris Becker of West Germany defeated third-seeded John McEnroe, 6-2, 6-3, yesterday in the semifinals of the Stella Artois indoor tournament in Milan, Italy.
In the final today, Becker will meet Aleksandr Volkov of the Soviet Union, who defeated Eric Jelen of West Germany by 6-2, 2-6, 7-6.


Past as Prologue
LEAD: ''This gives me chills.'' says Joseph Abboud, the New York men's-wear designer, who has been leafing through a volume of Norman Rockwell illustrations.
He finds what he is after, a 1940's Saturday Evening Post cover, whose subject, he admits, never fails to stir him.
Rockwell's depiction of a war veteran turned scholar is abrim with nostalgic detail.


Curtains Down
LEAD: Adela Holzer, a Broadway producer, has put on one act too many, according to the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau.
Ms.
Holzer, who was the toast of Broadway two decades ago as the producer of the rock musical ''Hair'' and other theatrical hits, was arrested last week on charges that she swindled investors out of $280,000 while posing as David Rockefeller's ''secret'' wife.


Answering The Mail

WHAT'S DOING IN: Taos
LEAD: Anchored by the massive adobe landmarks of St.
Francis de Assisi church on the south and by Taos Indian Pueblo on the north, Taos seems comfortably settled into winter.
Cozy interiors are a specialty here in New Mexico's high desert country, with beehive-shaped kiva fireplaces, Indian rugs, wooden beams overhead - and the sprinkling of hot tubs to be expected in a ski town.


Old Stones Surface, in Patios
LEAD: Ancient paving stones that were removed and stored during restoration of Florence's historic Piazza della Signoria have turned up in paths and patios at luxury villas, judicial officials said today.
They said magistrates were investigating four council employees and six homeowners in connection with the discovery.


The Rediscovery Of an Outsider
LEAD: JOSEF MEIERHANS (1890-1981) was featured at the Princeton Gallery of Fine Art in 1985, and some of his pastels were included in the recent miscellany of Delaware Valley painters at the Trenton City Museum.
The artist, nevertheless, is but a rediscovery-in-progress, and it is as such that he is now making a second appearance at the


Lucky Number?
LEAD: He has won 73 Winston Cup races, but none at Daytona International Speedway.
So Darrell Waltrip is hoping the matching numbers are a favorable omen for today's Daytona 500, when No. 17 will make his 17th attempt to finish first. ''If I win, I'm gonna spike my helmet in the winner's circle, and then I'm gonna do the Ickey Shuffle,'' Waltrip said yesterday.


The Underdog's Moment of Glory
LEAD: ONE of the fascinating facets of chess is the chance it offers the underdog to produce an incredible combination, a magnificent upset, a creation that would be worthy of a brilliancy prize.

Miami's New Ethnic Conflict: Haitians vs. American Blacks
LEAD: At Miami Edison Senior High School, many black students who came from Haiti share a common lie, insisting that they really came from the Bahamas.

LEAD: George Steinbrenner's involvement in sports expanded today when the United States Olympic Committee house of delegates elected him as one of three vice presidents to serve through 1992.


Basketball Twins On a Tear
LEAD: ON a basketball court, Jenny and Krissy Kuziemski resemble each other in so many ways that it is difficult to tell them apart.
In fact, if it were not for the difference in their uniform numbers, it would be virtually impossible to tell them apart at all.


Question Of the Week; Can The Yanks Use Guidry And John?
LEAD: Re-signing Tommy John and Ron Guidry would be a monumental, catastrophic mistake.

Phone Regulation
LEAD: To the Editor:


HIGHER EDUCATION-THE REAL CRISIS
LEAD: The problem for research universities like Columbia is not, as Michael Sovern contends, finding more money, and his suggestion that professors are going to start leaving these secure havens for rewards outside is laughable.
A low-level opening in the humanities produces 80 to 100 applications, even in a second-rate university.

'Rachel River': Long Journey From Dream to Screen
LEAD: SO YOU WANT TO MAKE A MOVIE?

Question Of the Week; Can The Yanks Use Guidry And John?
LEAD: The Yanks have many question marks such as Leiter, Jones and Eiland.
If any one of these guys can't cut it, John and Guidry might be able to step right in.
John didn't have that bad a season last year, and he does need only 14 games to reach 300.
If that isn't enough incentive to win I don't know what is.

FICTION
LEAD:  RUMORS.
By Catherine Mann. (Delacorte, $18.95.) Hollywood is so replete with real-life caricatures that it would seem superfluous to create a mannerist portrait of them.
Yet Catherine Mann, herself a one-time Hollywood reporter, has done exactly that. ''Rumors'' has all the hallmarks of a perfunctory nod to the literary form en route to the big payoff: the television mini-series.

Let's Stop Worrying About the Budget Deficit; For Capital Budgeting
LEAD: To the Editor:


FICTION
LEAD:  LONGING.
By Paul Reed. (Celestial Arts, $14.95.) A crucial test of a good writer is whether he or she can take a basically trite story and turn it into something memorable.
In his second novel, Paul Reed passes that test.
If ''Longing'' were the sort of teen-age saga that's devoured by 10-year-old girls, its plot would go like this: A girl moves to a new city, looking for love.

Not All the Boys of Summer Were Out on the Playing Field; Polo Grounds Justice
LEAD: To the Editor:


Take Me Out to the Ski Lift
LEAD: BASEBALL season doesn't start until April, but from all appearances baseball-cap season is a year-round affair.
A Yankee cap, for instance, is a perfect midwinter match for a full-length fur coat, and it doesn't look too bad with something more casual, like a windbreaker and turtleneck.
For men, the recommended attire is pin stripes or a bomber jacket, or both.


Islanders Remain On a Hot Streak

I had a chance to observe Fairleigh Dickinson students in 1980 and 1981 when I earned an M.B.A. on Saturdays in the university's ''M.B.A. for data- processing professionals program,'' an excellent concept that I wish could be expanded to the Ph.D.

Why Aging Athletes Can't Let Go
LEAD: In 1982, when I was playing with the St.
Louis Cardinals, Bob Watson pinch-hit against me and I struck him out.

Safaris

Cassavetes, A Model Of Defiance
LEAD: John Cassavetes, who died two weeks ago, will be as appreciatively remembered for what he didn't do as for what he did.

CORE CURRICULUM: OTHER OPTIONS
LEAD: Out-of-school people who missed a core curriculum during their formal education may do the reading for Fairleigh's core (or any other core) through their local public library.
Most libraries own most of the books, and any books not immediately available can easily and quickly be obtained through New Jersey's Interlibrary Loan


Review/Dance; Tics, Aches And Other Behaviors
LEAD: Janet Panetta and John Jasperse depicted compulsive behavior in the dances they presented Friday night at St.
Mark's Church under the auspices of the Danspace Project.
Both choreographers took obvious pains to devise elaborate tics and tremors.
Yet neither managed to make them consistently interesting.


Soviet Ship Bolsters New England Fishermen
LEAD: A Soviet factory ship stationed two miles off the coast has been a boon to local fishermen who find herring plentiful but buyers scarce.


Jerome Robbins Dances Back to Broadway
LEAD: Jerome Robbins, master choreographer, famed Broadway director, is leaning against a piano and singing.
The words are not from his new show, ''Jerome Robbins's Broadway,'' which opens next Sunday at the Imperial Theater.
Nor are they from any of the many musicals he directed and/or choreographed on Broadway from 1944 to 1964, from ''On the Town'' to ''Fiddler on the Roof'' - 11 of which are represented in this new production.


A Graphic Artist Risks Branching Out
LEAD: ''WE never fade,'' reads the caption under the picture of a grinning little black boy straddling a spool of Clarks black thread.
Standing nearby on the floor is a painted wooden figure, also a smiling black child, this one clutching a piece of hose.


UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT
LEAD: Rather than apologizing for not being interested in sports, why not show your individualism (surely, as American a virtue as spectator sports): proudly do yard work, in plain view of the neighbors, during some championship game.
Boldly tell co-workers of the book you read last night - when everyone else was tuned to ''the game.


Review/Concert; Barenboim Conducts the 'Missa Solemnis'
LEAD: The Beethoven of the early 1820's, the time of the Missa Solemnis, presents one of the unforgettable portraits in artistic history.
Here is the old master, deaf, unkempt, bewildered, buffeted by life, poring over the old masters of sacred music, pressing relentlessly inward and outward the frontiers of his own creative realm, composing a mass for the ages (''singing, howling, stamping'' it, in one famous account), while he slides recklessly into debt and negotiates duplicitously with half a dozen publishers for rights to (and advances on) the work.


Manager-Broker Tie No Longer Binds
LEAD: FOR many years, a real estate brokerage's path to commissions on the sales of cooperative apartments was built on contracts to manage the buildings.
That insider's edge led many firms to serve as managing agents for New York apartment houses at little or no profit, or even at a loss, as long as fat brokerage fees were coming in.


Why Are Film Tastes So Parochial?
LEAD: As I read the interesting article, ''Chinese Films Offer New Perspective'' (Jan. 22), I pondered the question of why we Long Islanders accept some foreign products eagerly while avoiding others.
We clasp alien cars, television sets and home appliances eagerly, while avoiding others.
When it comes to entertainment, though, we seem convinced that nothing on our screens is worthy of attention unless it is of domestic origin.


BOUTIQUE CHIC
LEAD: People in France may be perfectly happy hopping from store to store - in one shop for a loaf of bread, another for a few sausages and yet another for a bar of soap or a box of lily of the valley dusting powder.


Elizabeth Walker Weds
LEAD: Elizabeth Anne Walker, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
John R. Walker of Waterloo, Iowa, and Longboat Key, Fla., was married last evening in New York to Dr.
Steven Harris Schoenberger, a son of Dr. and Mrs.

A Dirty War Comes Home to the Soviet Union
LEAD: IN the final scene of a new documentary called ''Wound,'' dozens of young Soviet war invalids hobble down a beach to the sea, tossing their crude wooden crutches into a pile as they splash into the waves.
A viewer recoils at first from the unsightly stumps of legs, and then asks, as the filmmakers intend the audience to ask, and as one of the damaged veterans has already asked the camera: ''Za chto?


Death Rattle for a Dated Industry
LEAD: From Washington to Wall Street, and increasingly in the halls of academe, a growing chorus of economists and other financial experts is arguing that there is little justification for a separate savings and loan industry.


IN QUOTES
LEAD: ''People I think like to try always - whoever's President - to drive a wedge between the President and the chairman of the Fed.
It's one of the best fights in town.'' - President Bush, in an interview denying that he has substantial differences with Alan Greenspan.


Blooms, Blooms on the Range
LEAD: APRIL wildflowering is a ritual as vital to Texans as an October foliage outing is for Northerners.
It's a celebration of the delightfully warm, sunny days of midspring, before the blistering sun of the Southwestern summer makes a midday outdoor excursion an ordeal.
It's an extra excuse to search out the weathered, old wood and stone homes, stores and churches that form classic landscapes in the


CRIME
LEAD: Thomas H. Cook triumphs at teaching an old dog some new tricks in FLESH AND BLOOD (Putnam, $17.95).
When we met the series hero (in ''Sacrificial Ground''), Frank Clemons was a homicide detective working for the Atlanta police and nursing an obsession with a teen-age murder victim.
Clemons has since turned private eye and relocated to New York, where he is again fixated on a homicide victim.


Prison Officers Tackle Thankless Job
LEAD: The stereotype - conjured in the black and white of 1930's Hollywood prison pictures - is of a piggish brute, blackjacking cowering prisoners in the dark, dank cells of solitary.


Chicken: Cheap and Able To Marry With Many Flavors
LEAD: FOR an easy inexpensive meal, you can't beat chicken.
Because of its fairly bland taste, it is probably the most versatile food in the kitchen.
It goes with almost any kind of flavor, with herbs and mustard, or with Oriental, North African or Latin American spices.


POSTINGS: Tips From Pros; Home Show Workshops
LEAD: Homeowner Harrys and Harriets might benefit from professional house and apartment improvement tips at a series of workshops to be held Wednesday through next Sunday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.

The Cult of Original Genius Is Our Curse
LEAD: It is probably by chance rather than an attempt to shock us with yesterday's sensations that three of opera history's most celebrated events will be paid homage this week on New York stages.
The Metropolitan unveils its new production of Strauss' ''Salome'' tomorrow evening, the Philadelphia Orchestra offers a concert version of Verdi's ''Nabucco'' at Carnegie Hall the same night, and on Saturday, also at Carnegie, Herbert von Karajan and the Vienna Philharmonic present Act I of Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde.

Tea in London
LEAD: To the Editor: Sorry to inform you that your tea time in London article (Travel, Jan. 1) was incorrect.
The Ritz no longer has Sunday tea dances.

ANITA ARNOLD ADLER New York

ANGELENOS ON WHEELS: FROM BAD TO WORSE
LEAD: It has never been easy, but this has been one of the worst months in memory for the harried freeway drivers of Los Angeles, where the price of living near warm palm-fringed beaches, lovely mountains and deserts is that one can hardly get there.


Weight Costs Woman $500
LEAD: A woman who was given the option of losing 100 pounds to wipe out a fine on a marijuana conviction has failed to do so and must pay $500.
Judge Michael Fisher told the woman, Tina Usinger, last year that she could reduce her fine by $5 for each pound she lost, but when she returned to court this week, she still weighed 265 pounds.


Gripping Saga
LEAD: FOR THE NEW YORK METS, spring training has just gotten under way in Port St.
Lucie, Fla., but Bob Ojeda, a left-handed starting pitcher, has been warming up almost daily since the cast came off his throwing hand in mid-November.
By now, Ojeda says, his arm is strong, the muscles in his hand have been resuscitated by exercise, and his catchers are telling him his ball is moving as well as it ever has.


Prospects; Pushing Up Pay
LEAD: The Commerce Department's report early this month on January employment was seen by some economists as one more sign that wage increases are about to accelerate, adding to inflationary pressures.
Hourly wages, for example, rose at an annual rate of more than 7.6 percent.
Also noteworthy was the addition of 408,000 to the nation's payrolls in January, an unexpectedly sharp increase that was only partly explained by unseasonably mild weather.


Field Foundation, Civil Rights Pioneer, to Die at 49; Survivors Will Be Legion
LEAD: After 49 years of pioneering programs in support of children, minority groups and the poor, the Field Foundation is deliberately spending itself out of existence, hoping to leave a legacy of organizations to carry on its work.


Abortion Law In Italy Draws Growing Fire

John's coach, Lou Carnesecca, tried to keep his mind off how DePaul had come back to beat his Redmen two years ago.


Motorola's Labor War
LEAD: The violence is over at Motorola Korea Ltd. - at least for now.
There are no more workers dousing themselves with paint thinner, barricading themselves in the computer room and threatening to die for the right to form a union.
But the fledgling union and management are no closer to agreement than before.


The Gray Area in Government Bonds
LEAD: The Bush Administration's recently announced plan to float $50 billion of bonds to bail out failing savings and loan institutions would add yet another security to a wide array of fixed-income obligations issued by Federal agencies.
The agencies - including the Farm Credit System, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan


Separate Ways
LEAD: Vietnam is seeking American tourists and trade, and the Presidency is becoming a dim memory for Democrats.
And now Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden are saying it's over for them, too.
When they were married in 1973, Ms.
Fonda and Mr.
Hayden formed a union emblematic of the antiwar movement and the pop-leftist politics that grew out of the Summer of Love.


Former Leader of Klan Narrowly Wins Contest in Louisiana
LEAD: A former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, narrowly defeated his opponent to win a seat today in the Louisiana Legislature after a campaign peppered with charges of racism.

LEAD: On Friday, the Board of Elections is slated to mail letters to 300,000 New York City residents telling them that, as required by state law, they are being removed from the voter rolls because they have not voted in the last four elections.
Each letter will include a new registration form and a postage-paid return envelope.


Safaris
LEAD: To the Editor: The articles on luxury travel in Kenya were fascinating reading.
But I'd hate for your poorer readers to come away with the idea that reasonable comfort on safari is out of their price range.


Chocolate Pots Brewed Ingenuity
LEAD: Only minutes into ''The Way of the World,'' William Congreve's Restoration play set in a fashionable London chocolate shop in 1770, a leading character orders: ''Bring me some chocolate.''


An Emergence of Political Will on Acid Rain
LEAD: THE question of what to do about acid rain has pitted region against region and produced an angry stalemate in Congress for the better part of a decade.
Now, with President Bush backing action and with a realignment of forces on Capitol Hill, a revised Clean Air Act with strong acid rain controls is a distinct likelihood, perhaps as early as this year.


It's the Moves That Challenge
LEAD: MANY of the technical moves in cardplay seem to have straightforward parameters until examined closely.
Then they begin to blur around the edges.
A finesse is difficult to define satisfactorily.
An endplay can occur at the first trick.
A squeeze can operate in a single suit, and the declarer can be the victim.


Drawing a Bear, or Anything Else
LEAD: Back in mechanical drawing class we would labor for hours to create front, top and side views of a flange. (No one was ever quite sure what a flange was, but we had to draw one nonetheless.) Three views required three drawings and usually resulted in at least three inconsistencies.


Lori Meltzer to Wed
LEAD: Dr. and Mrs.
Murray A. Meltzer of Tenafly, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter Lori Glazier Meltzer to Peter Desider Starer, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward Starer of Tenafly.

Connecticut Studies Schools' Racial Imbalance
LEAD: Connecticut has 166 school districts spread out over its 169 independent towns, but the numbers disguise a deep imbalance: More than 80 percent of all minority children in the state - most of them black and Hispanic - are concentrated in just 14 districts in the largest cities, while elsewhere the schools are overwhelmingly white.


To Pay Tribute to the Dead, Many Donate to the Neediest
LEAD: In remembrance of her parents and her sister and brother, killed during the Holocaust in Poland on Aug. 19, 1942, Tonia Rotkopf Blair of Manhattan sent a contribution of $20 to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.


IDEAS &amp; TRENDS: Sketchy Statistics; The Rape Laws Change Faster Than Perceptions
LEAD: ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN, the Brooklyn District Attorney, tells of a recent rape prosecution: A 21-year-old woman had gone to her former boyfriend's apartment at his request to pick up some belongings.
As the jury heard it later, he tied her wrists with telephone cord, raped her and broke her nose.
The jury convicted him of assault and acquitted him on the rape charge.


Taking a Meeting
LEAD: Adrian Dantley, acquired by the Dallas Mavericks last Wednesday from the Detroit Pistons in a trade for Mark Aguirre, has requested a meeting with the Mavericks' owner, Donald Carter, before he will report.

LEAD: AS the new director of the Afro-American Cultural Center at the University of Connecticut, Ronald D. W. Powell is responsible for meeting the needs and interests of black students and for helping them learn more about their heritage.


Reverse Mortgages: An Assessment
LEAD: The article ''Elderly Are Offered Reverse Mortages''  [ Jan. 29 ]  is misleading.
The mortgages described are home-equity loans that place a second or possibly first mortgage on a house based on the house's value without regard to income and must be repaid in full with interest at the end of 10 years.

Now on View, New Work by Freelance Curators
LEAD: Art curators, once as anonymous as starving artists, have stepped into the spotlight of contemporary art.
With them comes a new definition of the job.
While curators of tradition are academically trained art historians who work in museums behind doors that say ''No Admittance,'' many of the new curators are young, often fashionable, art-world operators who are more a part of the scene than an establishment.


Gulf Coast's Rewards For Bird Watchers
LEAD: IT was a brilliant morning on a two-lane farm road about 50 miles southeast of Houston, not far inland from the Gulf of Mexico.
The big Texas sky was bright and blue, the air still except for the occasional passing of a clanky pickup truck.
We had stopped our car along the side of the road to show out-of-state guests a spectacle worthy of a cowboy's boast.

Rabbi Miriam Shapero and Cantor Jacob Yaron officiated.


Rustic Italian, With Sophistication
LEAD: SMITHTOWN'S Casa Rustica is a champion among Italian restaurants on an island loaded with contenders.

Farming the Wilds Of Middlefield
LEAD: As I read Bill Earls's essay, ''More Feed, More Line, More Wood: Down (and Out) on the Farm'' (Opinion page, Jan. 22), I'm convinced of one thing; namely, the more things change, the more they stay the same.

Repairing a Squeaking Floor

However, the condition is seldom more than an inconvenience and repairs are usually easy, even for the inexperienced.


ATLANTA CONTEST MAY TURN ON STYLE
LEAD: With the announcement that Maynard Jackson is seeking to be Mayor of this city again, the lines have been drawn for an election that may turn as much on differences in the histories and styles of the candidates as on promises for the future of the city.

Henry Kloss's Mail-Order Speakers
LEAD: A basic rule for picking a loudspeaker is to allow plenty of time for listening comparisons.
In fact, willingness to let customers become amply acquainted with a variety of loudspeakers under appropriately unhurried conditions is the touchstone that separates reliable and conscientious audio dealers from the rest.


CLASS ACTS II
LEAD: A few weeks back, we tossed off an informal classification of top California wines based - as was the famous 1855 Bordeaux classification -mostly on track record.
The wineries that made the cut: Beaulieu, Beringer, Caymus, Clos du Val, Chalone, Diamond Creek, Grgich Hills, Heitz, Inglenook, Mayacamas, Stag's Leap, Robert Mondavi and

Reviews/Music; Art and Virtuosity in Spanish Piano Sounds

LEAD: A New Jersey man responsible for a string of armed robberies in elevators in midtown Manhattan office buildings was arrested Friday evening after a woman he was trying to rob resisted, the police said.


Friendly Hunan in West Haven
LEAD: A RESTAURANT writer could keep busy reviewing Connecticut's Chinese restaurants alone.
It is not just the reviewing, but the need for re-reviewing, as nothing in the food service industry seems to change faster than the personnel in a Chinese restaurant kitchen. ''Very good'' today can turn into a mere ''satisfactory'' in a matter of weeks; such is the speed of the chef's revolving door.


Talk Shows: Morbid Curiosity
LEAD: I agree with Geraldine M. Fox  [ Topics, ''Abuse on TV,'' Jan. 29 ] .
Afternoon and evening expose and talk shows are not in the business of educating the public.
They are in business, period.
Dollar signs dance before them as they probe open wounds before the eyes of the morbidly curious.


Correction
LEAD: A caption on page 5 in some copies of the Arts and Leisure section today with an article about the theater director Ruth Maleczech reverses the two actors' identities.
Roger Guenveur Smith, who has a beard, is on the left; Tomas Milian is on the right.

Howard I. Levy, a physician, plan to marry May 20.


NEW YORKERS, Etc.
LEAD: SAY what you want, it's not really putting ''it'' off, whatever ''it'' may be, and it's certainly not the same thing as postponing.
It's simply neater.
It makes more sense.
Who ever heard of starting a diet on a Tuesday, or beginning an exercise program on a Thursday, or finally getting down to a long-term project on a


GORGEOUS LIAISONS
LEAD: Something was astir at the Papillon showroom on lower Madison Avenue.
Paula Carbone, the designer and president of the New York lingerie company, was bent over a sheaf of costume sketches.

So Far, the Biggest Budget Issue Is How to Apportion the Blame
LEAD: UNLIKE the budget battles of Ronald Reagan's first term, President Bush's first engagement with Capitol Hill is not a fight for fiscal direction so much as a dance around political blame.


Reconstructionist Jews Turn to the Supernatural
LEAD: Miracles and the Messiah are being restored to the liturgy of a small but influential movement in American Judaism that has spurned supernatural concepts for more than 40 years.


Make Federal Subsidy a Last Resort
LEAD: President Eisenhower's warning about the dangers of a military-industrial complex continues to have relevance for succeeding generations.
The issue has become increasingly urgent as the United States struggles to adjust to the challenges of a new internationally competitive environment.


Success Is Within Reach IS THE COLD WAR OVER? - An occasional series.
LEAD: With the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the unilateral reductions in tanks and troop divisions in Eastern Europe, Mikhail S. Gorbachev will have sharply reduced the major military threat to American vital interests.
If he continues pursuing his current agenda for the next several years, he will pose for the West for the first time since the late 1940's a conceptual challenge:


Chamber Concerts Fill the Schedule

We Must Act Locally for Housing
LEAD: WHEN I was my daughter's age, I used to enjoy sketching room plans for my house-to-be. (I think this followed hot on the heels of fashion layouts and bridal dress.)

The houses had conservatories and morning rooms, and money was no object.


Warsaw Begins to Tell Its Own History
LEAD: THE report that appeared in an official Polish publication last week attesting that Soviet troops were responsible for the wartime executions of 4,443 Polish officers in the Katyn forest was hardly a revelation.

Galveston's Sense Of Delight and Danger
LEAD: WHEN I first moved to Galveston in the summer of 1984, it was less than a year after Hurricane Alicia and the building boom that insurance money had brought to the island.

By Marshall Edelson.  392 pp.
Illinois:  University of Chicago Press. $39.95.


Teaching Corporate Executives the ABC's of Child Care
LEAD: If the growth of consulting firms that design family benefits programs for corporations is a reliable bellwether, employer-provided day-care assistance is finally taking off.


Q and A
LEAD:  Fall Birding


Classic Appeal: Long Silhouette
LEAD: Those who sell material by the yard have had a few worries lately, with the return of the miniskirt.
But it's not all bad news for purveyors of cloth, not by any means.
The long look remains very much with us, a stylish alternative to the shorter clothes that have become popular.


Editors' Note
LEAD: A review on page 15 of The Times Book Review today discusses ''Father and Son,'' a novel by Peter Maas about Northern Ireland and the Irish Republican Army.


'People Power' Revolution Is Commemorated in Manila
LEAD: President Corazon C. Aquino joined a crowd of tens of thousands today in commemorating the 1986 revolt that swept her to power.
She also heard the Archbishop of Manila assail corruption.


COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Office-Space Statistics; Vacancy Rate Is Just One Element of the Equation
LEAD: JUDGING from vacancy rates alone, Somerset County in northern New Jersey and Fairfield County in southwestern Connecticut are bloated twins, each with 22 percent of its office space empty.
But step back to analyze a variety of market conditions and the picture changes: Somerset looks as if it will absorb its excess space in two years, while


How to Take The Curse Off Convention Centers
LEAD: Surely no building type is as disdainful of urban values as the convention center.
Everything about a convention center flies in the face of what cities ought to be.
To make a good one, you need vast amounts of horizontal space, far more than can fit on a single city block.
So most convention centers end up stretching on for block after block, riding roughshod over any streets that are unlucky enough to fall in their path.


HOME ENTERTAINMENT/VIDEO: AND KEEP IN MIND
LEAD: Here are some of the most notable releases of the last few months.


Do-It-Yourself Customized Software
LEAD: Computer-aided software engineering, or CASE, is a process that is supposed to simplify the creation and maintenance of computer software.
It is just the type of help that is desperately needed by the many large businesses where the problem of maintaining, updating and fixing aging software has reached crisis proportions.


Doorbell Problems
LEAD: WHEN a doorbell malfunctions, the problem is usually easy to diagnose and correct.
Most systems consist of only three main parts and the wiring that links them.
Here is how an ordinary doorbell works: At one or more doors, pushbuttons are attached.
Each of these has a pair of thin wires connected to them.


WEEKENDS: REAL-LIFE FASHION
LEAD: Before the first crocus or daffodil even blooms, city dwellers show their colors in casual clothes based on down-to-earth comfort.
It is a style that at first may appear downright messy, with a mix of tattered old pieces and possibly a new oversize sweater.
But don't be fooled by the frequently disheveled look.


The Sweet and Sour Sounds of South African Jazz
LEAD: The tune ''Black Lightning'' opens ''Voice of Africa, The African Recordings'' (Kaz 101: record and CD, available from NMDS, 500 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10012), the first of a four-album, eight-record set of South African jazz by the pianist and composer Abdullah Ibrahim (Dollar Brand).
All the elements of South African Township jazz are there: the rolling ostinatos; the traditional African melodies; the gospel-inflected, sweet and sour tinged harmonies; the cotton-soft horn riffs and the relaxed dance beat implying that the world is, for the moment, without problems.


NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Old Orchard Beach, Me.; Fitting the Last Puzzle Piece
LEAD: IN an effort to change the honky-tonk image of this once-vibrant southern Maine seaside community, town leaders, developers and private citizens are planning an ambitious revitalization to attract businesses and residents to the downtown area.


Young New Yorkers Turn Party-Giving Into Parties That Give
LEAD: At some point this winter, maybe while she was striding past a homeless woman asleep on a subway platform, or watching a shivering panhandler near a cash machine, or listening, a bit skeptically, to a clown-costumed fund-raiser on the street, Melissa Mack decided it was time to have a party.


Trends in Taste Come and Go, but There's No Place Like Home
LEAD: A GREAT deal of attention is being paid these days to what is called nostalgia food.
The homey staples of childhood have become chic.


Correction
LEAD: An article on Jan. 1 about Hispanic residents seeking a larger role in government in Perth Amboy described the namesake of MacWilliam Stadium incorrectly.
Joseph Lockwood MacWilliam was an Army lieutenant at the time of his death in 1936, not a World War I hero.


House Calls to Help New York's Elderly Chinese
LEAD: Ka-Lam Pang's world has shrunk to a single narrow room, barely wide enough to accommodate his bed.
Bars set in the wall allow him to swing himself along in his wheelchair to reach the stove or sink when he is alone during the long shifts his wife works in a garment factory.


FOCUS: Enterprise Zones; Turning a Town From Gloom to Boom
LEAD: EVERYONE here remembers September 1984.
They call it ''Black September'' because that was the month that two factories closed, another laid off half its employees and unemployment in this town of 2,100 soared to 18 percent.


Sudan Leader Seeks to End Guerrilla War
LEAD: Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi, apparently yielding ground to the Sudanese military, said today that he wanted to broaden the political base of his Government and seek ''an acceptable peace formula'' to end a war with guerrillas in the south.


The Parks' Wildlife Issue, Again, Is Whether to Interfere
LEAD: AS hungry bison leave the sanctuary of Yellowstone National Park to be slaughtered by hunters in the largest buffalo kill of the century, conservationists are left once again to contemplate the difficulties of maintaining wildlife in a landscape that is, for the most part, no longer wild.


College Prospects Deserve Chance
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Bright Outlook For Casinos In 2d Decade
LEAD: THE casino industry here is moving into its second decade with a torrent of revenues and slowly improving profitability.

LEAD: Nancy Dickerson, a commentator for Fox Television in Washington, and John C. Whitehead, chairman of AEA Investors Inc., an investment concern in New York, were married yesterday at the bride's home in Washington.
Judge Abner J. Mikva of the United States Court of Appeals in Washington officiated.


Sports of The Times; A Surprise for Boxing's Wild Goose
LEAD: For a boxing promoter, Mickey Duff was trying to be honest.
Upstairs in the Las Vegas Hilton, Frank Bruno was waiting to challenge Mike Tyson last night, but now, in the lobby, the British co-promoter realistically assessed Bruno's opportunity to be the first British boxer to win the world heavyweight championship since Bob Fitzsimmons more than century ago.


LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  MARDI GRAS GALA  For about six weeks now, the Long Island State Park Region has been holding a Winter Arts Festival at Bethpage State Park, an event that ends today with what is called a Mardi Gras Gala.


Bridge
LEAD: Computers can play backgammon well enough to beat a world champion and chess well enough to beat everyone except the greatest.
But in bridge they have trouble advancing beyond the beginner stage.
Zia Mahmood, the globe-trotting Pakistani star, has offered a million dollars to a computer that can beat him at bridge.

But We Are Free?
LEAD: Salman Rushdie can see no end to the terror called up by the Ayatollah Khomeini.
For the rest of us in the Western world, there is an answer to intolerance and fanaticism.
That is to understand our own values, and accept the responsibility of defending them.


FACE VALUE
LEAD: IN THE COSMETICS industry, a business built on image, simple products are often wrapped in elaborate packaging, given snappy names and big price tags and photographed next to alluring faces.
Implicit in these advertisements is a promise that the product is at least partially responsible for the face, and that the face is something to strive for.


Joan Hirschhorn And David Bright To Marry in June
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Fred Hirschhorn Jr. of Old Greenwich, Conn., have made known the engagement of their daughter Joan Morgenthau Hirschhorn to David Evan Bright, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Alfred S. Bright of Scarsdale, N.Y.
A June wedding is planned.


Arena: Down an Alley Filled With Illusions
LEAD: FROM the beginning of ''Down an Alley Filled With Cats,'' it is clear that the characters are not who they appear to be.


Prospects; As Interest Rates Climb
LEAD: On Thursday, the nation's major banks raised their prime rates to 11.5 percent - the highest level in nearly five years.
Then, on Friday, the Federal Reserve Board raised the discount rate to 7 percent, the highest level since May 1986.
Four experts discuss how higher interest rates affect the economy.


Polish Police Fight Protesters As Solidarity and Regime Talk
LEAD: While the Communist leadership is negotiating with Solidarity, the police cracked down over the weekend on demonstrations and meetings in Cracow and other cities staged by small, independent groups that support the banned union but reject the negotiations.


THE NATION: Life Without Reagan; Conservatives Like Bush, but They're Watching Him
LEAD: WITH President Bush trafficking liberally in liberal oratory about the good things government can do, one might wonder whether conservatives are feeling a bit uneasy.
Certainly Mr.
Bush sometimes seems to mix his signals.
While Vice President Quayle reassured the faithful this weekend that Reagan-era policies were being carried forward, advocates for the homeless, for example, were being promised a change from the last eight years.


'Red Star Over China'
LEAD: To the Editor:


The Curtain Rises On Kelp Lasagna And Chopped Liver
LEAD: Although the current theatrical season has not yet provided much food for thought, it has given considerable thought to food.
On stages all over New York, breakfast, lunch and dinner are being served along with beer, wine, schnapps, tea in a glass and blue tropical drinks with or without tiny umbrellas.


Global-Warming Panel Urges Gas Tax in West
LEAD: Delegates at a conference on global warming have recommended steps to deal with the problem that emphasize the responsibilities of poor as well as rich nations.


THE REGION: A Bill in Suffolk; As the Suburbs Speak More Spanish, English Becomes a Cause
LEAD: AS Latin American immigrants settle in suburbs across the metropolitan area, state and local efforts to help them are coming under attack.
The immediate target is the use of Spanish by public workers and in official forms and pamphlets.
But the underlying issues are far larger.


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  SPENCE + LILA, by Bobbie Ann Mason. (Perennial/ Harper &amp; Row, $6.95.) In a novel by the author of ''In Country,'' a farmer helps his wife survive a bout with breast cancer.
Bobbie Ann Mason is ''very good at eliciting the special poignancy of people who don't really understand what is happening to them,'' Frank Conroy said here last year.


Miss Steinbreder Wed in Southport To M. A. Luciani
LEAD: At Trinity Episcopal Church in Southport, Conn., Susan Gay Steinbreder, a daughter of Mrs.
Harry J. Steinbreder Jr. of Fairfield, Conn., and the late Mr.
Steinbreder, was married yesterday to Michael Angelo Luciani, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Victor A. Luciani of Fairfield.
The Rev.
Francis X. Cheney performed the ceremony.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. I am having a constant problem with the sliding wooden doors on my closet.
The plastic wheels are supposed to slide along in a metal track fastened to the top of the door jamb.
Mine seem to have come off the track, so it is almost impossible to move the doors unless I pick them up.


Tyson Stops Bruno In Fifth
LEAD: Mike Tyson is back - with a vengeance.
Tyson, who had not fought for eight months, was brutally efficient tonight as he took apart Frank Bruno and stopped him at 2 minutes 55 seconds of the fifth round of a scheduled 12-round heavyweight championship bout.


Review/Music; Jerry Hadley in Song Recital
LEAD: Jerry Hadley's tenor sounded in reasonably good health at Weill Recital Hall on Friday night.
We know it mainly as an operatic instrument, but here Mr.
Hadley - an American singer with a substantial international stage career - divided a recital of songs among Brahms, Vaughan Williams, Britten and Rachmaninoff.


AN AMERICAN BOY IN GANGLAND
LEAD:  BILLY BATHGATE  By E. L. Doctorow.  323 pp. New York: Random House. $19.95.


Rushdie Novel Stirs Passions East and West; Create a Devil
LEAD: To the Editor:


Aguirre Leads Piston Victory
LEAD: Mark Aguirre's accomplishments have always been accompanied by controversy.
He spent eight and a half seasons with the Dallas Mavericks, excelling as one of the top small forwards in the National Basketball Association.
He also endured tempestuous relationships with two head coaches.
He was criticized for lack of effort.


With Tears, Griffith Joyner Bows Out
LEAD: For the third time in a week yesterday, Florence Griffith Joyner cried in public.
In all likelihood, it will not happen again for quite a while.


Italy Feels The Pangs Of Drought
LEAD: It dawned gray and dank today, as it often has in the last few months, the skies seeming to promise badly needed rain but whispering fresh disappointment instead.


A Bedroom Farce
LEAD: ONCE again, I was in bed with the Asian flu.
For two weeks, my husband brought me a lovely white Victorian bed tray and served Saltines and cups of soup.
And for a while afterward on weekends, even when I wasn't sick, he would bring coffee up to the bedroom.


PRESIDENT BACKS SOVIET OVERTURES ON TIES TO CHINA
LEAD: President Bush said Saturday that improved relations between Moscow and Beijing could enhance the prospects for peace in Cambodia.


Many Clergymen Quiet in Rushdie Case
LEAD: Few American religious leaders have made their voices heard in the controversy over Salman Rushdie's book ''The Satanic Verses,'' although the debate has raised important issues of religious sensitivity, freedom of conscience and the power of religious authority.


Fashions of The Times/Magazine Part 2
LEAD:  Special reports in this issue include:


Correction
LEAD: An article last Sunday about funds to study and clean Long Island Sound misstated Gov.
William A. O'Neill's proposal for the state's Clean Water Fund for the next fiscal year.
Mr.
O'Neill recommended an appropriation of $75 million, not an elimination of $40 million.


Reviews/Music; The Yma Sumac Mystique
LEAD: Yma Sumac, the Peruvian vocal phenomenon, has always fearlessly straddled the line between the sublime and the ridiculous.
In 1950, when ''Voice of the Xtabay,'' her first album of multi-octave mystical warblings, created a sensation, Miss Sumac was already regarded as something of a camp oddity, albeit one who possessed singular gifts.


Ethics - In and Out of the Classroom
LEAD: The article, ''The Tough Job of Teaching Ethics'' (Jan. 22), prompted an unusually strong response from readers.
Some of their comments follow.
To the Editor:


A LOT HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT JAMIE
LEAD:  FATHER AND SON  By Peter Maas.  316 pp. New York:  Simon &amp; Schuster. $18.95.


Pollution Parable
LEAD: ACCORDING TO TOM J. THORDARSON, when the developers of Big Bang Schtroumpfs, the $85 million theme park set to open on May 9 in Metz, France, approached him to create a theatrical extravaganza as an attraction for the new park, they gave him a few parameters.
The show was to be nonverbal, so as to be accessible to all international visitors.


IMAGINE THIS
LEAD: Passers-by, intrigued by the distressed steel facade with ''One Off'' etched in a strange scribble, can look through a peephole for a fisheye glimpse of the architect Ron Arad's gallery and office.
What they see will make them even more curious.
The former storage space is now totally clad in an envelope of metal, with tiny pinpoints of light directed at an array of whimsical metal furniture.


State Workers Center of Labor Talks
LEAD: NEGOTIATORS are preparing for what may become the year of the state government contract.
The state employs more than one-fourth, or 12,400, of the 52,780 unionized employees facing contract negotiations this year in Connecticut.

LEAD: Democratic candidates raised more money and spent more than Republicans last year in campaigns for the 101st Congress.


Pirates Hang On to Top Friars
LEAD: With 10 minutes remaining in the first half at Byrne Meadowlands Arena today, Andrew Gaze had 17 points and Providence College 14.
Since Gaze's Seton Hall teammates had supported him with 10 additional points, the situation was grim for the Friars.


After a Pause, Writers Stood Up for Rushdie and Themselves
LEAD: FOR a dictator to want to kill a person for his opinions is as old as political power itself.


A REMEDY BUT NOT A CURE
LEAD:  SECOND CHANCES  Men, Women, and Children a Decade After Divorce.
By Judith S. Wallerstein and Sandra Blakeslee.  329 pp.
New York: Ticknor &amp; Fields. $19.95


China's Showcase Company
LEAD: The Gold Cup Automobile Company is China's pride: a behemoth corporation that embodies China's hopes of transforming its state-owned factories into efficient, market-oriented enterprises.


Northern Comfort in Vermont
LEAD: AMONG many skiers the feeling is, the closer the ski area the better.
Such thinking may account in part for the popularity of such ski resorts as Hunter Mountain in the Catskills or Mount Snow in Vermont.
The proximity brings with it bigger crowds, longer lift lines and higher prices.
On the other hand, longer drives to relatively remote ski areas in northern New

WHEN SEX WAS ALL THAT MATTERED
LEAD:  EIGHTY-SIXED  By David B. Feinberg.  326 pp. New York: Viking. $18.95.


Building Anew in the Yucatan
LEAD: IT is a cruel and sardonic god, the Mayan rain diety Chaac, who rules over the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.
Five months ago he unleashed his fury in the form of Hurricane Gilbert, wreaking devastation on the glorious white beaches, coral reefs and hotels and restaurants that have long lured visitors to the resorts of Cancun and the nearby island of Cozumel.


Speaking of the Unspeakable
LEAD: IN 1981, ON THE LAST day of my freshman year in college, I was raped in a park near my dorm.
In this country, nearly three out of every four women could be the victim of a violent crime during their lifetime.
What is unusual in my case is that the rapist is now serving a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison.


State Preparing to Act on Full Landfills
LEAD: THE East Haven landfill was filled to capacity more than two years ago, but the town continues to use it. ''We're in the same boat as a lot of other towns at this point,'' Mayor Robert M. Norman said.


Tufts to Divest All Its South Africa Holdings
LEAD: Tufts University will divest itself of all its holdings in businesses operating in South Africa, university officials announced late today.

LEAD: A bank clerk and two other women were each found handcuffed and shot in the head in the clerk's Bronx apartment Friday in what the police said yesterday may have been a retaliation killing over drug trafficking.


AT DARTMOUTH THE CLASH OF '89
LEAD: TWO DAYS INTO THIS YEAR, ON JAN. 3, A NEW Hampshire judge ordered Dartmouth College to reinstate two suspended students.
Chris Baldwin, former editor in chief of The Dartmouth Review, and John Sutter, executive editor, were suspended last spring for disorderly conduct, harassment and invasion of privacy.


THE STEINBERG TRIAL
LEAD: In her article ''The Steinberg Trial: Scenes From a Tragedy'' (Jan. 15), Patricia Volk got my quote all wrong.
I said (unaware that it was for attribution) that Hedda Nussbaum was becoming media savvy, dressing smarter, watching her words, trying not to appear despicable.
This came out, ''She's despicable,'' a far cry from the original thought.


Indoor Pollution: Other Views
LEAD: New Jersey doesn't have enough real problems for legislators to address!
We don't need to fix the auto insurance mess.
We don't need to stop the sexual transmission of AIDS.
We don't need to force an independent audit of waste in autonomous authorities.
We don't need real progress in the fight against drugs.


Assembling Brooklyn's Hispanic History
LEAD: The Brooklyn Historical Society, which adopted its new name and changed its focus to emphasize the people who live in the borough now rather than those who originally peopled it, has embarked on an ambitious project to present the first full picture of Brooklynites with Latin roots.


STEVENSON BEATS J.F.K.
LEAD: The Public Schools Athletic League has been having its basketball playoffs for the last two weeks, but the defending champion, Adlai Stevenson of the Bronx, did not play its first game until yesterday at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan.


What to Do When the Taj Mahal Is for Sale for Half the Price
LEAD: BY the time I sell my house, an efficiency apartment will be plenty big enough.
I've been so obsessive and obnoxious, no one is going to want to live with me anyway.
I'm convinced that selling your house is divine retribution for the mortal sin of trading up.


Paul M. Giddens And Liz Loewy Engaged to Wed
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Dr. and Mrs.
Robert G. Loewy of Loudonville, N.Y., of the engagement of their daughter Esther Elizabeth Loewy to Paul Michael Giddins, a son of Ellen Giddins of New York and the late Robert Giddins.

Sherman S. Lawrence of Roslyn, L.I.
Ms.
Bier, an account executive at WCBS-TV in New York, graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and Cornell University.


THE WORLD: Washington Is a Battlefield Again; So Far, El Salvador's Negotiators Are Not Interrupting Their War
LEAD: WHILE Salvadoran political leaders and guerrilla commanders were discussing a rebel peace proposal in Mexico last week, there was a sharp surge in the violence that has once again come to characterize the civil war here.
It demonstrated anew that El Salvador has turned on its head Clausewitz's dictum that war is a continuation of politics by other means.


CHILDREN AFTER DIVORCE
LEAD: The thrust of Judith Wallerstein's article is that divorce per se is harmful to children.
I am concerned that this focus will distract attention from the more significant issues, which are that dysfunctional families and parents are harmful to children, regardless of marital status.
Ms.
Wallerstein briefly acknowledges that divorce may be a more satisfactory solution to problems than continuing a harmful marriage.


Other Aspects Of Hague's Career
LEAD: I would like to comment on the well-written article on Jan. 8 about Frank Hague, who was Mayor of Jersey City from 1917 to 1947.


Money Becomes More Expensive
LEAD: The cost of money rose last week when the Federal Reserve increased its discount rate to 7 percent, from 6.5 percent, and banks lifted prime lending rates by a half point, to 11.5 percent.
The Fed, which has been nudging short-term rates upward for some time, said it took the action ''in light of inflationary pressures.


POSTINGS: Garden Spot; An Inside Job
LEAD: Often the first clue to a building's rental tenants that a co-op or condominium conversion is in the works is when a formerly shabby lobby suddenly gets a fresh coat of paint and new carpets and furnishings.
The residents of the Royal York, a three-building, 750-unit complex on 63d and 64th Streets between York and First


Dr. Eisemann Weds Dr. Wilson Crone
LEAD: Dr.
Donna Marie Eisemann, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Robert Francis Eisemann of Lindenhurst, L.I., and Dr.
Wilson Crone, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Walter Seth Crone of Charleston, S.C., were married yesterday morning at the Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church in Durham, N.C.
The Rev.
Donald Frederick Staib officiated, assisted by the Rev.


Daddy's Little Girl, Up to Date
LEAD: FOR some of us who emerged from college in the 60's and married young, the meaning of fatherhood has shifted dramatically as the women's movement and changing family structures led to new opportunities and new challenges.


Question Of the Week; Did Babe Ruth Call His Shot?
LEAD: Yes, he called his shot, though the Babe himself reportedly denied it.
But this legend has a twist.
Rather than guaranteeing the monstrous trajectory over the right-center-field wall of his next four-bagger off Charlie Root in the third inning of Game 3 of the 1932 World Series at Wrigley Field, Ruth might just as plausibly have been pointing to the downtown saloon where he would be celebrating the day's 7-5 victory.


Time for a Public Broadcasting Overhaul
LEAD: Public broadcasting is broke, and it ought to be fixed.
Viewers and listeners have been saying that for years - they want more and better programs for their money.
Yet, this important institution lumbers on, unable to rise to its full potential because of the way it was set up in the first place.
The question is, how do you fix it?


Magic Returns
LEAD: The two-time defending N.B.A. champion Los Angeles Lakers got their Magic back Friday night after he was sidelined for five games by a partially torn hamstring.
The Lakers went 3-2 without him, but they dominated the Sacramento Kings, 115-103.


It's Farce - So Please Do Slam the Door
LEAD: To hear the director Jerry Zaks tell it, farce is the most dangerous, treacherous, dead-earnest business there is.
If you don't have a door to hide behind, you're a goner.


And Now Pitching for Cuba: Castro; Batting for Reds: Rose
LEAD: After finishing second for four successive seasons, Pete Rose would like to finish first this year.
But after his team finishes first, he has another desire.
If he fulfills that one, it would result in a meeting of the managers of the two largest contingents of Reds in the Westen Hemisphere.


About Cars; A Fan and Vintage Wheels
LEAD: It is late at night, and I have been talking to friends.
As happens, the conversation turned to automobiles, and I started to hold forth on the cars I have always wanted and never had.
They are a strange mix, and they say something of who I am - which is one of the important things that cars are supposed to do.


Libby Schmeltzer And Rick Hinson Engaged to Wed
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Mr. and Mrs.
Edward Schmeltzer of Potomac, Md., of the engagement of their daughter, Elizabeth Sabine Schmeltzer, to Rick Franklin Hinson, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Eldon F. Hinson of Redding, Calif.
The couple plan to marry in June.


Enlightened and Refined, By Meets Girl
LEAD: FOR many single adults, the notion of meeting a mate at a bar or on a blind date is distasteful.
But without a partner, they often feel they cannot do some of the things they would like to, like go to concerts and plays.


TRAVEL ADVISORY
LEAD:  Checking Out Health Risks On Cruise Ships


Physician's License Is Suspended in Sex Case
LEAD: The state has suspended the license of a doctor whom some patients have accused of having sexual relations with them, then performing abortions on them without their knowledge after they became pregnant.


CAMPUS LIFE: Yale University; Cure for February: Just One Party After Another
LEAD: February always seems to be the cruelest month, a cold, slushy torment of flu and midterms between the winter holidays and spring break.
For undergraduates at Yale College, however, February is not a total loss.


Switzerland
LEAD: To the Editor: Having vacationed in Switzerland over 30 times during the past 30 odd years and having enjoyed many delightful meals in the top restaurants of main railway stations, my wife and I greatly enjoyed Mr.
Shenker's article.


Pursuit of Dreams in 'The Rabbit Foot'
LEAD: There's a potentially boiling hot play that, right now, is just simmering at the Crossroads Theatre Company.
What is holding back ''The Rabit Foot,'' by Leslie Lee, which ends its run next Sunday?
It is overwritten - much, much too windy - overlong discursive, even unclear.
But not irreparable.


On Hand for the Civil War and Manifest Destiny
LEAD: IF there were such a category as ''Found Earthworks,'' the print ''Granite Canyon, From the Water Tank'' might qualify for it.
Photographed by Andrew Joseph Russell (1831-1876), it is said by some reference books to be the Union Pacific Railroad heading west from Cheyenne, Wyo., no doubt for Promontory Point in Utah, where it was joined to the Central


Question Of the Week; Did Babe Ruth Call His Shot?
LEAD: In 1969, while I was a roving radio sports reporter for several suburban New York radio stations, I had the pleasure of interviewing Pat Piper at Wrigley Field in Chicago.
Piper was the public-address announcer at Wrigley and had performed those duties at that ball park for more than 50 years.
I posed the same question to the now-deceased Pat Piper: ''Did Babe Ruth call that famous shot?


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. I am having a constant problem with the sliding wooden doors on my closet.
The plastic wheels are supposed to slide along in a metal track fastened to the top of the door jamb.
Mine seem to have come off the track, so it is almost impossible to move the doors unless I pick them up.


Review/Ballet The Donetsk 'Giselle' Presents a New Cast
LEAD: The Donetsk Ballet, which concludes its brief engagement this afternoon in New York, offered a new cast in 'Giselle'' Friday night.
Marina Leonkina, who had not been featured on the company's previous performances at the City Center (131 West 55th Street) made her local debut in the title role and scored nothing short of a triumph.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Review/Recital; Istomin Does It His Way

Switzerland
LEAD: To the Editor: Israel Shenker's article ''In Switzerland Train Stations Are for Eating'' (Travel, Jan. 8) brought back memories.

For Czechs, Caution Is a 20-Year Habit
LEAD: ''LAYING flowers is not a punishable crime,'' Alexander Vondra, a defendant in one of the dissident trials last week, told a Prague court.
But the Czechoslovak authorities thought it was.
Mr.
Vondra and seven other dissidents, including the prominent playwright Vaclav Havel, were convicted and given prison sentences for last month's gathering in Prague's Wenceslaus Square to mark the death 20 years ago of Jan Palach, a student who set fire to himself to protest the 1968

Doorbell Problems
LEAD: WHEN a doorbell malfunctions, the problem is usually easy to diagnose and correct.
Most systems consist of only three main parts and the wiring that links them.
Here is how an ordinary doorbell works: At one or more doors, pushbuttons are attached.
Each of these has a pair of thin wires connected to them.

A Newport Desk's Towering Style
LEAD: In Newport and neighboring Providence 200 years ago, merchants were kings and their desk-bookcases status symbols that dominated parlors and countinghouses.

The Academy's exemplary retail outlet for art books and artists' materials has been mated with an Italianate cornucopia in which Italian herbs, Italian cookies and Italian olive oil all have their place.

Varied Vietnamese at Fair Prices
LEAD: IT is a pity that Lotus, a tiny Vietnamese restaurant in Vernon, about 13 miles east of Hartford, could not be cloned and relocated in other parts of the state.
Not only is the food among the best Vietnamese cooking found in Connecticut, but it is also fairly priced.


Egypt
LEAD: To the Editor: Your stories on Egypt (Travel, Jan. 1) closely reflected my experience, but a fond memory of Shepheard's Hotel impells a mild demurral at the description of it as faded.

Clerics and Politics: Why There Are No 'Moderates' in Iran
LEAD: AYATOLLAH MOHAMMED YAZDI'S green eyes flashed with impatience during a flight from Teheran to the Persian Gulf island of Lavan about two weeks ago.
He had just been asked whether he considered himself among ''pragmatists'' or revolutionary ''purists'' in Iran's leadership.
Such terms, the ayatollah replied, do not apply to


A Church's Turmoil
LEAD: The teachings of Vajradhatu, a branch of Tibetan Buddhism with 3,500 to 5,000 followers in the United States, Canada and Europe, do not prohibit homosexuality or sex with more than one partner.
But the religious group has been shaken over accusations that its leader, Osel Tendzin, regent of the Vajradhatu International Buddhist Church, knew he had AIDS and transmitted it to his sexual partners.


CAMPUS LIFE: University of Texas; 'Paper Chase' Is Giving Way To 'L.A. Law'

LEAD: AS Washington reverberates with the latest cost estimate of the savings and loan industry debacle, economists are beginning to ask what implications this sorry episode has for the age-old debate over whether Government should play a greater role in directing the economy.


A Reminder of Some Turkish Delights
LEAD: THE sign in the window of Great Neck's Tarabya Restaurant reads ''Authentic Turkish Restaurant.'' Exotic, unknown and foreboding as that might seem, fear not.


Limits to the Duty to Rescue
LEAD: IT may be the most basic purpose of government, but a state's protection of citizens from one another is required by the Constitution in only a few circumstances.
Last week, the Supreme Court decided that shielding a child from abusive parents is not one of them.


Successes in Affirmative Action
LEAD: THE board of trustees of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, meeting Feb. 9, voted unanimously to take strong issue with the New Jersey Opinion page article by State Senator Ronald L. Rice on Feb. 5.
The article contains serious distortions about the university's service to the minority community.


Artistic Ambiguity
LEAD: Merce Cunningham hopes his dances speak for themselves, and he hesitates to explain them.
Thus, when asked recently why he used the word ''cargo'' in the title of ''Cargo X,'' the choreographer said, ''It's just a word.
I picked it.'' But why? ''It provokes something,'' he finally acknowledged. ''It's a poetic, ambiguous word.


Encourage Liberal Arts At Community Colleges

MORE THAN A BIMBETTE - YOU BET
LEAD:  THE FORTUNE  By Michael Korda.  481 pp. New York:  Summit Books. $19.95.


Changes Loom for Home Equity Loans
LEAD: Because of the changes brought by tax revision, the home equity loan has been one of the hottest banking products for the last couple of years.
Now, new changes in Federal law are likely to reshape the market for these loans.
While many of the changes are designed to bolster legal protections for borrowers, they are also likely to make the loans less readily available and more costly, banking experts say.


Newsletters That Point the Way in Different Ways
LEAD: TRAVEL newsletters are a growth business, not surprising considering that the tourism industry, now the No. 3 industry in the country (after food and autos), is predicted by the Commerce Department to be in first place by the turn of the century.
Add to that the reality that a home computer enables almost anyone who can type a letter to be a publisher, and you have a decade in which newsletters have popped up with regularity, although they have often dropped off within months.

LEAD: Every year, at least one American city finds itself overwhelmed by the measles, a disease many people thought had gone away.


POSTINGS: Design Snag; 100 Affordables
LEAD: Five years ago, the New York Housing Partnership identified six sites in the South Bronx for housing affordable by families earning up to $30,000 a year.
It took that long for the Partnership to line up the financing and the many government approvals needed for the 50 two-family homes it planned, and then, late last year, the project hit a snag: The State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation asked that the design be modified to make it compatible with structures in the adjacent Longwood Historic District.


Enterprise Zone Turns a Town From Gloom to Boom
LEAD: Everyone here remembers September 1984.
They call it ''Black September'' because that was the month that two factories closed, another laid off half its employees and unemployment in this town of 2,100 soared to 18 percent.


Part of Old Boston Is Transformed, Drawing Shoppers to the Back Bay
LEAD: More people than ever - Bostonians and tourists alike - are flocking to Newbury Street, a fashionable eight-block stretch in the Back Bay where one can find shops and boutiques offering everything from Swiss lingerie to Japanese food to a Swedish massage.
The new magnet is ''upper'' Newbury Street, the blocks between Exeter and Hereford Streets, at the far end of Newbury's gateway at the Public Garden and the Ritz Carlton Hotel (Newbury's cross streets run alphabetically, from Arlington to Hereford).


INSURANCE PLANS A WASTE FOR MANY
LEAD: More than five million older Americans, mistakenly believing they are adding to private coverage that supplements Medicare, are paying for unnecessary, duplicative health insurance.

Seeing Zambia, Wart Hogs and All
LEAD: IT is the sense of intimacy with the landscape that lingers - climbing down river bank chutes carved by hippos' bellies, uncovering the speckled eggs of the water dikkop bird, or the delicate trace of a crocodile's tail etched in the warm sand.


Distilling the Drama in the Building of the A-Bomb
LEAD: In an article last Sunday about ''Day One,'' a TV drama about the building of the first atomic bomb, James F. Brynes was misidentified, and his involvement in the decision to drop the bomb on Japan was incorrectly described.
He was Secretary of State under President Truman and argued in favor of using the bomb.


Question Of the Week; Did Babe Ruth Call His Shot?
LEAD: When Babe whacked that memorable blow, I was screaming along with my father and a thousand other fanatics who'd paid $1 for the privilege of listening to the amplified radio broadcast in the auditorium of the Knights of Columbus, as on stage young men scurried around posting runners on a huge, green diamond.


Egypt
LEAD: To the Editor: Having visited Egypt in February 1987, I would like to comment on some of the notes on accommodations.


Doctors Preferred Over Medical Tests in Malls
LEAD: The article ''Medical Testing at Mall'' (Jan. 1) raises the specter of ''let the buyer beware.'' The article focuses on a shopping center-based, walk-in medical testing unit which produces cholesterol test results in 10 minutes.
This is based on newer medical technology advances well known to those of us in the clinical laboratory profession.


CHILDREN AFTER DIVORCE
LEAD: I was interested to read Judith S. Wallerstein's article ''Children After Divorce'' (Jan. 22).
I believe not enough attention is given to the children of broken homes.
I can testify to the fact that often deep wounds are sustained and that even after a lifetime they may never have healed.

LEAD: Only the armed services and the undertaking business are more regimented in their daily uniforms than Wall Street, where, for men at least, the color of money is gray.
But some say there's light at the end of the street, as more men expand their fashion repertoire.
Last summer's unrelenting heat stretched many suit wardrobes, driving even the most conservative men to don sport coats.

Britain Asks Soviets for Action on Iran

Women Must Respect the Choices of Women
LEAD: I HAVE learned that women who do not work full time outside their homes are not permitted complaints.
Dissatisfaction with anything is strictly verboten.
Since I chose to stop working full time at a high school three years ago in favor of teaching adults part time, I have had all rights to gripe rescinded, especially by women who remain in the workplace.


The Hard Truth About Soft Money
LEAD: MONETA WAS THE cult title of the Roman goddess Juno, in whose temple coins were stamped out; that's where the word &gt;money comes from.
The root of much evil, however, is in the modifiers of &gt;money - the adjectives that sow such confusion that you have to flip a coin to decide their meanings. &gt;Funny money is clear: counterfeit.


Library's New Arrival
LEAD: It is getting so that academia is to the New York Public Library what the arms industry is to the Pentagon.
The library, which lost its last president, Dr.
Vartan Gregorian, to Brown University, announced last week that its next chief executive will be the Rev.

The Solitude Is Ending
LEAD: Distant events no longer trickle slowly, slowly into the everyday.
For a generation, Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel ''100 Years of Solitude'' was a metaphor for the introverted, hopelessly closed circle of Latin America's societies, punctured now and then by clumsy, greedy incursions of the U.S. giant but still absorbent and self-sealing.


Joanne Galett Is Bride Of Andrew N. Sperling

Rabbis Gunter Hirschberg and Harvey Tattelbaum performed the ceremony.


Election's Weight
LEAD: Special elections to fill vacancies in state legislatures seldom turn heads, but the one last weekend in an affluent, nearly all-white suburb of New Orleans had heads shaking across the country.
With a huge turnout of 78 percent of the electorate, David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan running under the Republican banner, won the legislative seat in Metairie by 234 votes out of the 16,688 cast.
