THE SUBURBAN REVOLUTION
LEAD: THIS winter we are reading and hearing more about New York's homeless, but with spring we will turn to other pursuits.

IN SULPTURE, STEEL EPICS AND POP ICONS IN TWO SHOWS
LEAD: For some time now, the big subjects of European and American art have been very different.

All Right, Let's Keep It Clean
LEAD: BY the end of January I have usually managed to tackle at last some of the chores that I had resolved to clear away for the new year.
High on that list of thankless, postponed tasks is a bit of computer maintenance.
I am not talking about changing the ribbon on my printer, nor am I referring to such basic upkeep as standardizing the labeling system for my floppies.

NIGHTMARISH SEARCH FOR HOUSING HAUNTS NEW YORK'S WELFARE RECIPIENTS

WRITING OFF THE DEEP END
LEAD: WHY are we so interested all of a sudden in a French writer who has been dead for a quarter of a century?
Why should there be, just now, three new books by or about Louis-Ferdinand Celine?

ARHTUR MILLER: STIRRED BY MILLER
LEAD: The two new one-act plays by Arthur Miller that open at Lincoln Center next Sunday are thematically linked under the title ''Danger: Memory!'', which could be taken as a symbolic warning to the playwright.

JAZZ: ROVA SAXOPHONES
LEAD: THE Rova Saxophone Quartet's favorite sound is a tangled, writhing, pulsating lump of noise - one that might involve repeated phrases, improvised lines, trills, raucous honks or a tightly packed combination of all four.
The group writes and plays chamber music laced with improvisation, cross-referencing Stravinsky, Satie, Albert Ayler, Steve Reich and James Brown's horn section.

Insuring Your Trip Against the Unexpected
LEAD: Few areas of the travel industry are more competitive than the sale of emergency assistance and insurance.

Q &amp; A
LEAD: 'Reasonable' Consent  Question: In a recent column you wrote that ''the owner of a rent-stabilized co-op may not unreasonably withhold consent to a sublet, and the unit may be subletted for two years out of any four-year period.''

Since their health and genetic history are known, such ''purpose-bred'' animals yield superior data.
Still, each year, some 300,000 dogs and cats are bought from animal shelters for laboratory use.

They cost less.
Congressman Robert Mrazek, Democrat of New York, has introduced legislation to prohibit the National Institutes of Health from funding experiments that use shelter animals.

REAL MEN SAIL FOR THE CUP
LEAD: SOONER or later, an expletive will not be able to be deleted.
But in permitting a minicamera-microphone on their 12-Meter yachts, maybe that's what the America's Cup skippers had in mind all along.

Glasnost And the Churl

FICTION: IN SHORT
LEAD: GHOSTLY POPULATIONS.
By Jack Matthews. (Johns Hopkins University, $14.95.) Children tell two kinds of tales: ghost stories and jokes.
As they get older the jokes get dirtier and the ghosts are forgotten.
But Jack Matthews gives the impression ''of a man listening to his childhood.'' Like the narrator of his title story, he is a collector of ghost stories, and his characters mutter old riddles as though they're mantras - ''What has four wheels, hemorrhoids, and a dream?

LEAD: FEW lines have more effectively caught the chill of modernity than the conclusion of Wallace Stevens' poem ''The Snow Man:'' ''For the listener, who listens in the snow, / And, nothing himself, beholds / Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.''

DID THE SUPER BOWL LIVE UP TO THE HYPE?
LEAD: The Super Bowl game surpassed the hype.
Perhaps it was because of my deep interest in this particular game, as a Giants fan.

Classical Music
LEAD: Goethe referred to chamber music, and the string quartet in particular, as a discourse between reasonable individuals.

An American In China
LEAD: From August 1985 to July 1986, I taught English at the Changsha Railway Institute, and much of what Mark Salzman described in his article rang true to me (''Of Confucius, 'E.T.' and Happiness Candy,'' Dec. 21).

Westhchester Opinion; INEXPLICABLE RECOGNITION: 'IT'S AN EAGLE! AN EAGLE!
LEAD: ''OH, my God,'' exclaimed my 14-year old son, Dutch, using his strongest allowable expletive for around the house.
What he uses elsewhere I can't vouch for. ''It's an eagle!'' We were watching the Giants-Redskins game, which had been much touted; I, casually, mainly reading The New York Times Magazine; he, the football player of the family, intently.


ACTORS LEND VOICES TO SERIES OF SHORT-STORY READINGS AT SYMPHONY SPACE

NICARAGUA IS AIDED BY SISTER CITY PROJECTS
LEAD: IF someone could ask for more trees on East Ninth Street, Joanne Schultz and some friends figured, they could also ask Community Board 3 in Manhattan to support a negotiated peace in Nicaragua.
It worked, and in 1985 the Lower East Side, a neighborhood that encompasses the Bowery's skid row, the cutting edge of avant-garde art and a large Puerto Rican and Asian population, became a sister city to Barrio Nueva York, a community of 1,000 in Bluefields,


HOW TO PLOT A TOUR OF BRITISH GARDENS
LEAD: British gardeners have been mucking about in their soil, more or less continually, since Roman invaders showed how easy it was to clip boxwood shrubs into peculiar-looking blobs.

NAMING THE LIVING TO HONOR THE DEAD
LEAD: I THINK it is the ultimate honor to name a child after someone who has died.
In our case, my husband and I wanted to name our son after my brother Mac, who was killed in a plane crash when he was 22.

As my pregnancy advanced, however,

A Daughter's Father
LEAD: I WAS APPLYING FOR A PASSPORT FOR MY 18-month-old daughter when I froze at the marital-status question.
Give the kid a chance, I thought, she's still in diapers.

I recognized the feeling, which first appeared soon after Annie was born.
But it wasn't until that day at the Passport Office that I began to focus on just how radically my outlook has changed simply because my child is a female.

Shoes, Over and Under
LEAD: For two weeks now, a gray sky has hung low over New York City, spitting.
Mostly it spits snow, sometimes it spits rain and occasionally it spits something that it would be a kindness to call sleet.
The sun shows its face only long enough to prove it's still up there.
So slush is piled at the curbings, and trying to walk some streets is like trying to traverse the Wollman Rink without skates.


A CORRECTION
LEAD: An article in the Real Estate section Jan. 18 on the effect of the porters' union contract on commercial rents incorrectly stated the frequency of the rent increases and which aspects of the wage increases would have an effect on rents.

HOME IMPROVEMENT
LEAD: ALTHOUGH a home or apartment may seem to have plenty of closet space when you move in, all too often you later discover you need more.

That way you only have to build two walls for the new closet; the other two are already in place.

CHOOSING PLANTS, FOR WINDY ROOFS
LEAD: WHAT'S gaudy, fascinating and tantalizing beyond a city gardener's space for planting?

Ride 'em, Robot!
LEAD: Horse racing at Madison Square Garden may sound farfetched.
After all, 1,200-pound thoroughbreds are obviously too big for the arena, and such scaled-down mounts as 500-pound hackney ponies are too little to make any speed while carrying 120-pound jockeys.

Q&amp;A
LEAD: Q.The siding on my house is rough sawn cedar.
I have been told not to caulk the joints where the boards overlap as the siding must breathe.
Is this true, and will caulking cause sweating and condensation?
A.It probably will not cause condensation, but it is unlikely to do much good: this siding is not meant to be very airtight.

White at Citadel Says Hazing Was Harmless
LEAD: A racial hazing incident at The Citadel, the military academy here, inflicted ''no harm or damage whatsover'' on the black cadet involved, one of the five white cadets in the case contends in court papers.


GERHARD KLOPFER, GENERAL IN TH SS
LEAD: Gerhard Klopfer, a former SS general who was the last surviving member of the 1942 Berlin conference that plotted the ''Final Solution'' to systematically kill European Jews, died Jan. 28.
He was 81 years old.


COUNTRYMAN UPSETS WILANDER
LEAD: An early-season tennis tournament is a lot like the first few days at school after the summer recess.
Minds tend to wander and work habits are sometimes poor.
It is when some of the better students of the game are more vulnerable than they are at any other time of year.


CORRECTIONS
LEAD: A table in Business Day on Jan. 28, showing short interest in Nasdaq stocks for the month ended Jan. 15, carried an incorrect total supplied by Imreg Inc. to the National Association of Securities Dealers for that company's class A stock.
As a result, the total Nasdaq short interest and the decline for the month were also given incorrectly.


Who Axed Military Raises?
LEAD: Amid all the discussion about big pay increases for members of Congress, judges and top civilians in Government, nobody seems willing to say just who rejected any real effort to get similar raises for top military officers.


Coleco Disclosure
LEAD: A legal dispute between MCA Inc. and Coleco Industries over rights to the ''King Kong'' name set off the talks that led to MCA's acquisition of a 9 percent stake in Coleco, according to Arnold C. Greenberg, Coleco's chairman and chief executive.
The dispute was settled as part of the agreement announced Tuesday.


MUSIC: LIBOVE AND LUGOVOY
LEAD: ALTHOUGH the violinist Charles Libove and the pianist Nina Lugovoy democratically billed their Monday-night program at Merkin Concert Hall as a joint recital, it was Mr.
Libove's lean, full tone and dapper technical expertise that made the evening a memorable one.


TIMES SQUARE: TRYING TO KEEP THE PANACHE
LEAD: That night in November 1965, when the electricity failed, Times Square disappeared.
While the rest of the city merely went dark, the square that with appropriate immodesty calls itself the crossroads of the world vanished in a blackness made more stygian because it so contrasted with the usual nocturnal blaze of glory that is its trademark.


PUBLISHER TO SEEK REHEARING OF SALINGER BIOGRAPHY BAN
LEAD: Random House has decided to file a request this week for a reconsideration of the recent Federal Appeals Court decision barring it from publishing an unauthorized biography of J. D. Salinger.

Now things are much worse.

SIX YOUNG FASHION DESIGNERS: CREATIVITY ON THE HOME FRONT
LEAD: MIRIAM BENDAHAN, a designer of elegant evening dresses, greeted a guest in the doorway of her three-room East Village tenement walk-up.
Or more precisely, in its kitchen, between her bathtub, which holds a dish rack, and a plank supporting a jagged piece of mirror - her vanity.
Two shoes, painted silver to match her kitchen walls, were hanging above the door.


HOW TECHNOLOGY CAN BREED BOREDOM
LEAD: THE purpose of better technology, as anyone knows, is to foster laziness and sloth among the populace.
That's what's going on with the up-and-coming formats for prerecorded music, the cassette (which now commands considerably more than half the market) and the compact disk.
While they've been coming into their own, popular music has encouraged basking rather than rocking out - a tendency that fits right in with the new technology.

LEO CASTELLI TAKES STOCK OF 30 YEARS OF SELLING ART
LEAD: Leo Castelli, whose celebrated gallery has played a key role in shaping American art over the last three decades, admits to a certain bafflement about the current scene.
The man who has tirelessly promoted such movements as Pop, Minimal, Conceptual and Neo-Expressionist art, and such talents as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Julian Schnabel, confesses that - as he approaches his 80th birthday - he really doesn't ''know where things are going.


CONCERT: ORFORD QUARTET
LEAD: THE Orford String Quartet, a Canadian ensemble now in its 21st year, appeared Tuesday night at the 92d Street Y for a most interesting concert.
The interest lay not in the boldness of the repertory, which was entirely conventional, nor in the seemingly ordinary fact that these musicians applied an intense, dramatic style to the music at hand.

BOX STEP FOLLOWS A BIG BAND TO BARNARD
LEAD: ''Side, together, forward.
Side, together, back.
Quick, quick, slow.'' The instructions had the sound of a dance and deportment class in an elementary school gym.

Flower Power
LEAD: Uncle Sam may soon sabotage St.
Valentine's Day.
The International Trade Commission is considering invoking sweeping penalties and duties on imported flowers, which could possibly double the cost of flowers sold on the streets of American cities.

GUARDING THE PLAYWRIGHT'S VISION
LEAD: To the Editor:


Housing Policeman Stabbed In Brooklyn Traffic Dispute
LEAD: An off-duty housing police officer was stabbed in the back yesterday during a traffic dispute in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn, the police said.


TIPS FOR NONSKIERS ON THE SLOPES
LEAD: DO you jump out of bed early on a winter weekend, raring to hit the slopes?
Does your spirit soar at the thought of flying over mountain moguls from dawn till dusk?

Headliners; New Blood
LEAD: As some in Washington see it, the newly designated chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Dennis R. Patrick, might be a sort of re-run of his predecessor, Mark S. Fowler.
Like Mr.
Fowler, Mr.
Patrick, whose appointment President Reagan announced last week, is a firm suppporter of deregulation of the broadcast industry.


Executives Adrift
LEAD: An employer's offer of half-pay until retirement age not to come to work would sound fantastic to some, even without forced layoff.
I suspect that many employees might voluntarily elect that option, were it presented to them.


THE IMPACT AND INFLUENCE OF JOHN CAGE
LEAD: Approaching his 75th birthday - the date is Sept. 5 -John Cage looms among us, twinkling, patriarchal, inspiring and annoying in all the right ways.
It seems almost certain that Mr.
Cage's place in musical history will be a significant one.
It was he who fathered a whole generation (or two or three) of experimental composers in this country and the world, and who did more than anyone else to introduce the contemplative aura of Oriental religion and philosophy into the highly individuated, careerist sensibility of the


IN CONTEST FOR INDUSTRY, INDIANA SCORES
LEAD: FOR decades, as a conservative foothold in the industrial Midwest, Indiana relied on low tax rates and a laissez-faire tradition to lure and keep businesses.
But in the recession of the early 1980's, unemployment rose, productivity declined and a series of plants closed, stunning a state that had seemed immune to such troubles.


A MISTRESS OF HERSELF
LEAD: To the Editor:


Chilean Admits Role in '76 Murder
LEAD: United States courts long ago established an official Chilean role in the 1976 murder in Washington of Orlando Letelier, an exiled opponent of President Augusto Pinochet.
But the case has never been resolved because Chile has refused to extradite the suspects.


Q and A
LEAD: Nullifying an Amendment  Question: About 50 percent of the residents bought their apartments when our building was converted to a co-op last year.
As part of his negotiations with the tenants' association, the sponsor agreed not to apply for major-capital-improvement rent increases for repairs he was planning.


ARE CONVENIENCES STILL CONVENIENT?
LEAD: WAS it only last year that leaving the house was a simple process?
I would grab my purse and keys and my briefcase if I were going to work.
If I were going shopping after work, the newspaper fliers and my envelope of manufacturers' coupons would be taken as well.
A quick stop to be sure that the evening's dinner was defrosting in the refrigerator and


Contra Political Chief Will Quit Triumvirate
LEAD: Arturo Jose Cruz, a key political leader of the Nicaraguan rebels, has confirmed that he is resigning because of dissatisfaction with other rebel leaders.


EARLY ISRAELI OFFER TO CONTRAS RECALLED
LEAD: A group of former Israeli intelligence officials approached the Central Intelligence Agency nearly five years ago and offered to supply untraceable weapons to the Nicaraguan rebels, according to a senior American official familiar with the affair.


ISRAELI TOLD BUSH CONTACTS IN IRAN WERE 'RADICALS,' NOT MODERATES
LEAD: Vice President Bush was told last summer by an Israeli official that ''we are dealing with the most radical elements'' in Iran because dealings with moderates had proved unsuccessful, an aide to Mr.
Bush said today.


U.S. PRESSES INDIA TO SEEK BEIRUT HOSTAGE'S RELEASE
LEAD: With few options of its own in the Lebanon hostage situation, the United States is quietly pressing India to seek help from Syria and Iran in at least freeing the one captive who is Indian, American and Indian officials say.


WORKING A SQUEEZE WITHOUT THE COUNT
LEAD: In the 60-year history of contract bridge there have been two men, and only two, whose names have become household words.


Hudson Riverfront Dispute Is Resolved
LEAD: TWO developers who tangled in court over access rights across an old railroad spur on the Hudson River waterfront in North Bergen, N.J., have reached a settlement.


Taking a Nice Cake on the Iran Mission
LEAD: To the Editor:


THE ROYAL PROGRESS
LEAD: Mary Queen of Scots, a much-traveled monarch, seems to have spent about half her reign on a horse, and many of the surviving castles she stayed in are being spruced up to mark the anniversary of her death.


PITT WINS AS FRIARS' OUTSIDE GAME FAILS
LEAD: Much has been made of Providence's use of the 3-point shot.
But this afternoon, Pitt showed the Friars a thing or two about scoring 3 points the old-fashioned way, with muscle.


POSTINGS: 300,000 Sq. Ft.; Rehab by Trinity
LEAD: Trinity Church strikes a commanding pose on the lower Manhattan landscape, holding landmark status in the realms of architecture, spirit and more earthly matters.
But now the church, a significant landowner, is making its presence felt in a new way, with the conversion of an old industrial building on the Lower West


WHAT'S NEW IN MASSAGE
LEAD: MASSAGE has had a tenuous link with medicine for years.
Nurses traditionally administered back massages to soothe the aches of bed-ridden patients, and even today many nurses and physical therapists study massage techniques.


DEFINING GOOD DESIGN
LEAD: To the Editor:


Bookshelf
LEAD: Additional titles of interest:


Social Security
LEAD: To the Editor:  If Social Security payroll taxes discourage employers from hiring and employees from working (''Put a Permanent Lid on Payroll Taxes,'' Forum Jan. 25), they fairly suffocate something else: Initiative.


WHITE HOUSE FACING CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE
LEAD: As Ronald Reagan enters the final two years of his Presidency, his White House has started to lose the distinctive aura of confidence and control that contributed heavily to the many achievements of his first six years in office, according to White House insiders and Reagan supporters outside the Government.


FROM FRANCE, A TASTE OF EUROPE'S AVANT GARDE
LEAD: Innovation and creativity are taken for granted in American dance - in large part because modern dance in this country has been rooted in such principles.
Not so in most of Europe.
The opera-house network in many countries there frequently goes hand in hand with an establishment taste, with resident ballet companies in those theaters catering to an establishment audience.


THE GREAT BOARD OF ESTIMATE MARATHON: SOUND AND FURY BUT LITTLE SUSPENSE
LEAD: It was shortly after noon Thursday that the Board of Estimate began its hearing on an ambitious plan to replace the old Coliseum at Columbus Circle with a huge two-tower complex, complete wth indoor atrium and eight movie theaters.


Taking Shape
LEAD: IT SEEMS LOGICAL THAT FASHION designers should shorten hemlines now.


A SQUEEZE AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES
LEAD: IN Farmington, community-college courses are held not only in junior and senior high schools, but also even occasionally in the conference room of a nearby hotel.


CAUTIONARY NOTE ON L.I. ECONOMY
LEAD: VIRTUALLY every economist we have heard from and most of the publications and sources we consult in monitoring and anticipating the progress of the Long Island economy have told us that 1987, like 1986, will be another good year for our region.


The New C.E.O.
LEAD: To the Editor:  ''Remaking the American C.E.O.'' (Jan. 25) is an unwarranted, unfair and simplistic attack on an entire class of mostly patriotic and hard-working American men and women.


FRANCIS WELLS DAVISON
LEAD: Francis Wells Davison, a physician who specialized in disorders of the ear, nose and throat, died Thursday at the Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pa.
He was 84 years old.


ECUMENICAL FESTIVITIES
LEAD: Church Revival Feb. 18 - After firefighters spent five hours fighting the blaze last May at the Episcopal Church of the Ascension in Jersey City, little remained of the Gothic structure built in the 1870's.
Faced with a million dollar rebuilding estimate, the church is extending its appeal for funds to Manhattan with an 8 P.M.


MARIANNE MOORE IN POEM AND OBJECT
LEAD: The objects that inspired Marianne Moore were startlingly diverse: a picture of an Egyptian desert rat, a Kiwi shoe-polish can, a magazine advertisement for Missouri hogs, a mechanical crow, a swatch of emerald-green brocade.


STUDENT PARKING IN GREAT NECK
LEAD: I read and reread the article ''No Parking''  [ Long Island Journal, Jan. 11 ]  in disbelief.
As a student of the school I must set the record straight.


SOUTH AFRICAN POP BREAKS OUT
LEAD: When the Grammy Awards are handed out Feb. 24, Paul Simon's ''Graceland'' album will be a strong contender.


Comings and Goings
LEAD: THE 1958 Heisman Trophy winner, Pete Dawkins, will be the principal speaker at the Jesse Owens Trophy Awards dinner in New York Feb. 24. . . .
Vincent dePaul Draddy, the chairman of the National Football Foundation's College Football Hall of Fame said that three deceased players had been elected to the hall.


THE LIFE OF A 'SNOWBIRD'
LEAD: Carol Cott Gross was right! ''Snowbirds'' who reside in condominium complexes do take advantage of the ''sunset specials,'' do snitch packages of Sweet 'n Low and frequently assign self-appointed ''condo commandos'' to protect their pool, clubhouse and residence.
But Florida's ''Condoland'' is more.


THE SINGLE IS COMING INTO HIS/HER OWN
LEAD: ''WESTCHESTER male - 39.
Professional, enjoys tennis, reading, seeks bright, compatible female early 30's.''


Q and A
LEAD: Caribbean Resorts  Question: Can you suggest a family resort in the Caribbean with a reasonable price in winter that includes two meals and water sports and on an island with direct flights from New York? - L. K., Larchmont, N.Y.
Answer: Many resorts meet these requirements, but the search can be narrrowed somewhat by referring not to direct but to nonstop flights.


JOANN E. SIKORSKI TO MARRY IN MAY
LEAD: The engagement of Joann Elizabeth Sikorski to Kerry Batchelor Watterson, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Stephen W. Watterson of Bay Village, Ohio, has been announced by Mr. and Mrs.
Edward J. Sikorski of Northport, L.I., parents of the bride-to-be.
A May wedding is planned.


DON MARRON'S DREAM SLIPS AWAY
LEAD: DONALD B. MARRON, chairman of the Paine Webber Group, delighted recently in showing a visitor the playful new David Hockney photo montage hanging on the wall next to his desk.
At a glance, it was hard to tell if the jumbled image was falling apart, coming together, or in a state of dynamic equilibrium.


DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER'S PLAN FOR RESIDENCES
LEAD: My compliments on the Jan. 25 article ''Fears on Mental Center Proposal,'' centering on the interaction between the Long Island Developmental Center's program and the surrounding community.


RECEIVERS DRAW ATTENTION
LEAD: The venerable saying that there is more than one way to skin a cat has not lost its validity.
In audio, for example, different approaches often lead to the same end, as in the case of two currently popular receivers - one by Nakamichi, the other by Yamaha.
They have been attracting attention because they confront audiophiles with contrasting design precepts.


IN TAIWAN'S SNAKE ALLEY, SUPERSTITION AND SIN In Taiwan's Snake Alley, Superstition and Sin
LEAD: Du Giang-long carefully arranged his pharmaceuticals on a table and began to extol the value of such products as deer antlers, monkey heads and flying lizards.


Miss Kindred to Marry David Yewer in March
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
G.
Estabrook Kindred of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Skytop, Pa., have announced the engagement of their daughter Dorothy Estabrook Kindred to David Edward Yewer, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward H. Yewer of Chenequa, Wis.
The wedding is planned for next month.


DEATHS FORCE PHILADELPHIA TO FACE HOMELESS ISSUE
LEAD: Despite at least two calls to the police from neighbors, a 60-year-old man died from hypothermia and alcoholism early this week after he locked himself out of his unheated rowhouse here and tried to sleep on the front stoop of a neighborhood bar.


In Israel, a Course to Calm the Savage Word
LEAD: Last month, eight centuries after Maimonides's advice on gentle social discourse, rival politicians had a scuffle in Parliament that left one wearing a sling.


KLANSMEN, CHANTING 'WHITE POWER,' MARCH IN ATLANTA SUBURB
LEAD: About 100 members and supporters of the Ku Klux Klan marched through this suburban Atlanta town today, raising their fists and chanting, ''White power.''


THE THRESHOLD OF GOD'S THOUGHTS
LEAD: FEARFUL SYMMETRY The Search for Beauty in Modern Physics.
By A. Zee.
Illustrated. 322 pp.
New York: Macmillan Publishing Company. $25.


Fordham Beats Fairfield Twice
LEAD: It took four weeks and four free throws, but Fordham finally defeated Fairfield in basketball yesterday.
In fact, the Rams won twice, and by the same 74-70 score.


7 Guilty of Lesser Charge in Texas Fraud Case
LEAD: After a long trial of 10 employees and officers of three companies on charges including racketeering, fraud and theft, including theft from the Government, a jury has convicted seven employees of obstruction of justice.


Cessna Strays Near Jetliner
LEAD: The Pilot of a Western Airlines jet with 59 people aboard veered to the left while approaching the international airport here Friday to avoid a small plane that strayed near the airliner, a Federal official said.
Lee Fryer, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said a single-engine Cessna 172 and a Western Boeing 737 flying from Las Vegas, Nev., had been given final clearance to land on parallel runways.


LIGHT CAMCORDER ADDS FEATURES
LEAD: Apparently acting in the belief that good things come in small packages, Sony has consistently shrunk the size of its products, the Walkman being emblematic of these efforts.
In video, this attitude culminated in the Handycam - a bantam camera-recorder combination that may be regarded as the video version of the Walkman.


Brook Naff Plans to Marry Michael Fulton in May
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
William Herbert Naff Jr. of Easton, Conn., and Great Harbour Cay, the Bahamas, have announced the engagement of their daughter Elizabeth Brooks Naff to Michael Scott Fulton, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
John Anthony Fulton of Greenwich, Conn.
A May wedding is planned.


Going On in the Northeast
LEAD: CONNECTICUT DOG RACES


THE QUESTION OF CONDOM ADS
LEAD: Should television carry advertisements for condoms?
The question is part of a growing debate.
In a recent speech in Washington, Dr.
Otis R. Bowen, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said that a worldwide AIDS epidemic in the next 10 years would be more devastating than the Black Plague.
Meanwhile, there are heated discussions over sex education.


HAVOC AT THE 19TH HOLE
LEAD: STRANGERS IN PARADISE By Lee K. Abbott. 255 pp.
New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. $18.95.


OPERA: MALFITANO AS MASSENET'S 'MANON,' AT THE MET
LEAD: ANY lingering doubts that the Metropolitan Opera has become a director's house should be dispelled by the staging of ''Manon'' that made its debut Friday evening.
Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, who produced and designed this production, has so encrusted Massenet's pathetic love story with stylistic sequins and painterly images that poor


EFFORTS SEEK TO INCREASE NUMBER OF BLOOD DONORS IN COUNTY
LEAD: FOUR men were honored recently for together donating a total of 45 gallons of blood over several years to the Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco.
They received plaques and hospital officials spoke at a ceremony designed to mark the unusually large donations.


MISS HOLMES IS BRIDE OF R. G. TASHJIAN
LEAD: The marriage of Cynthia Nash Holmes, the daughter of Maj.
Gen.
Robert S. Holmes, U.S.A., retired, and Mrs.
Holmes of San Francisco and Soda Springs, Calif., to Richard G. Tashjian, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
George Tashjian of Flushing, Queens, took place yesterday.
The Rev.
Edward Johnson, a cousin of the bride, performed the ceremony at St.


The Eternal Race For Tourist Cash
LEAD: EVERY year the pursuit of tourist dollars leads to imaginative planning in communities across America.


Infante Wins Suit
LEAD: ACIRCUIT COURT jury in Jacksonville, Fla., has awarded Lindy Infante, the Cleveland Browns' offensive coordinator, $87,500 in a ruling that the Jacksonville Bulls of the United States Football League breached Infante's contract in 1986.
After more than two hours of deliberation Friday, the jury of four men and four women awarded


A Year Later, Few Clues in Tylenol Poisoning
LEAD: One year ago today, Diane Elsroth, a 23-year-old stenographer from Peekskill, N.Y., who was staying at the Yonkers home of her boyfriend's parents, took an Extra-Strength Tylenol capsule for a headache and went to bed.


Mountain Climbers in Textbook Ordeal
LEAD: AWINTER storm, a series of bad decisions and sheer panic could have claimed the lives of two young men from Massachusetts who were climbing New Hampshire's 3,165-foot-high Mount Monadnock during the middle of last month.


MISS DE MAYO ENGAGED
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Salvatore J. Grieco of Brooklyn have announced the engagement of their granddaughter Christine Ann de Mayo to David Edouard Wagner, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edwin J. Wagner of Raleigh, N.C.


NEW YORKERS, ETC.
LEAD: WHOEVER said ''take care of the small things and the big things will take care of themselves'' was seriously naive.
That doesn't mean, however, that small things shouldn't be taken care of.
They definitely should, and the first of the small things to go should be the irritating habits of others.


Killer's Plea Imperils a Greek Leader's Prestige
LEAD: A plea for clemency in an 11-year-old murder case has led to a political dispute that is threatening the prestige and future of President Christos Sartzetakis.


DO YOU LIKE THE COLLEGE 3-POINT BASKET?
LEAD: Over recent years basketball has evolved into 7-foot behemoths pushing and shoving for territory under the basket for easy dunks, tip-ins or layups.
Placing a premium (3 points) on 19-foot or greater shots returns a modicum of skill to the sport.
Rebounds and tip-ins should be equivalent to a foul shot (which incidentally many of the ''big men'' cannot seem to conquer).


300 MARCH AT BROOKLYN PRECINCT
LEAD: More than 300 demonstrators chanting ''79th Precinct, Undercover Crack-house,'' marched yesterday from a junior high school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn to the 79th Precinct station house to protest what they said was police collusion with drug dealers.


RECITAL: JESSYE NORMAN
LEAD: JESSYE NORMAN is gifted with a soprano voice of oceanic magnitude and power; she is also, at her best, a moving interpreter.
Therefore, her Thursday evening recital at Carnegie Hall came as a distinct disappointment.


MAPLE SUGARING DEMONSTRATION
LEAD: Members of Brownie Troop 582 from Hanover Township as they were given tour at the Great Swamp Outdoor Education Center in ChathamTownship.
Children were shown evaporation stove, above and below, and were even alowed a taste of the final product, at right. (Ralph Ginzburg)


Aquino Wins Big On Constitution As Truce Ends
LEAD: Putting aside the guns and knives that played a sinister role in previous elections, Philippine voters gave President Corazon C. Aquino and her Government a ringing endorsement and new legitimacy last week.


DO YOU LIKE THE COLLEGE 3-POINT BASKET?
LEAD: It is too short!
Players are averaging more points than they should be.
Larry Bird and Chris Mullin would have averaged over 40 points a game in college with this line's ridiculous distance from the net.
Players do not show that they are capable of playing in the N.B.A. by scoring from this distance.


NURSING SHORTAGE HAS BECOME ACUTE
LEAD: AS enrollment in the state's nursing schools has dropped 40 percent; as more and more nurses leave the field to pursue more lucrative careers, and as outpatient clinics multiply around the state, hospitals are acting vigorously to recruit and retain nurses for the growing number of vacancies.


The Istanbul Synagogue Massacre
LEAD: Far too much is made out of shreds of circumstantial evidence in Judith Miller's article.
Who is to say that the Soviet-made arms used in the terrorist attacks did not come from somewhere else, perhaps even from Israel's enormous stocks of captured Soviet-made weaponry, some of which have reportedly found their way to the


ENDING ALTMAN'S LAZY DAYS
LEAD: LAST year, when the two C.P.A.'s planning to buy B. Altman &amp; Company's retail stores took their first close look at the 121-year-old department store chain, they went into a state of shock.
The merchandise mix, the huge numbers of non-sales employees, even the amount of office equipment in use, all seemed more attuned to a company seeking a tax loss than one looking for a profit.


SUNDAY OBSERVER
LEAD: HERE IS THE MORNING line on candidates for 1988:





SOME PRUNES CAN BE SHOW STOPPERS
LEAD: WHY is it we hate prunes so much when we are children?
Perhaps it is because they show up in such unflattering circumstances: stewed and served on top of cereal, or with custard for dessert.
But prunes are transformed when they become adult food.
They go wonderfully with rich winter meats such as pork, venison, duck or goose, and even with chicken or veal.


IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD: AMBITIOUS MEN: Their Drives, Dreams, and Delusions.
By Srully Blotnick. (Viking, $18.95.) Srully Blotnick, a business consultant and author, writes with his numbers instead of his heart.
Mr.
Blotnick, whose previous books are ''The Corporate Steeplechase'' and ''Otherwise Engaged: The Private Lives of Successful Career Women,'' here analyzes successful men.


ON LANGUAGE
LEAD: I HESITATE TO QUIBBLE over what many would consider an inconsequential lapse,'' writes Jerrold G. Weinberg of Norfolk, Va., ''but feel constrained to do so by a lawyer's compulsion for precision and a love of Kipling.''


PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC
LEAD: THE Weimar Republic was born in 1919, one month after the Treaty of Versailles, and lasted until 1933, when it was deposed by the Nazis.
Except for a few years prior to the World Depression, the period was one of political and economic chaos that was in large part the result of the harsh terms imposed on


Mobutu Tries to Maintain A Delicate Balancing Act
LEAD: REPORTS that the United States shipped arms through Zaire to the rebels in Angola have complicated Mobutu Sese Seko's delicate balancing act in southern Africa.
With nine countries as neighbors and with an economic dependency on South Africa, Zaire's President tries to give the appearance of being everyone's friend.


Miss McGuiness Plans to Wed S.P. Webster
LEAD: Eileen Mary McGuinness, a training coordinator in the C.P.C.-Tarrytown division of the General Motors Corporation in Tarrytown, N.Y., and Stephen Paul Webster, the Connecticut district sales manager in the Pepsi-Cola division of Pepsico Inc. in Purchase, N.Y., plan to be married in June.
The future bride's mother, Mrs.


5 OF 27 CARIBOUS IMPORTED TO MAINE DIE
LEAD: Five of 27 caribous brought to Maine recently in an effort to reintroduce the animal to the state have died, two on the trip from their native Canada late last year and three within two weeks after their arrival at a compound at the University of Maine in Orono, the project's director said.


Father Sues School in Son's Suicide at Home
LEAD: The father of a 13-year-old boy who committed suicide at home in 1984 has filed suit against school officials here, charging that teachers and administrators should have known the boy was troubled and likely to harm himself.


A PIANIST, A VIOLINIST AND A COUNTER TENOR
LEAD: TWO of the three debut recitals offered in New York last week gave impressions of sturdy, at times inelegant, professionalism.
The third perhaps should not have taken place at all.
Janusz Skowron

ACTORS COMMEND LOCAL WORKSHOP
LEAD: TAKE it from the Mount Vernon actors Crist Swann and Steve Fowler.
Once you have fallen under the influence of Tina Sattin, a self-described acting coach, you are bound to become her disciple.


ISRAEL'S NAVY SEIZES A BOAT OFF LEBANON AND 50 PALESTINIANS
LEAD: The Israeli Navy today reported seizing a cargo boat with 50 Palestinians described as guerrillas trying to sail to Lebanon.


Our Friends Shake Their Heads; Privatized Diplomacy
LEAD: To the Editor:


2 NURSING HOMES FOR VETERANS
LEAD: TEN years ago, nursing home and medical facilities for military veterans on Long Island were woefully inadequate, experts agreed.
Studies showed that by 1990 the Island would have 86,000 veterans over the age of 65, the largest concentration in the state.

64 Escape at Mexican Prison After Gun Battle With Guards
LEAD: Inmates seized rifles from the armory at the Sinaloa state penitentiary last night and 64 escaped after fighting a gun battle with guards, the authorities said.


CAMPAIGN SEEKS TO HELP SLAIN WOMAN'S CHILDREN
LEAD: LYNNE JONES was deeply shaken when she learned that Helle Crafts, a neighbor and an acquaintance, had been found murdered near her home in Newtown.
Although she had not known Mrs.
Crafts well, each had endured the difficulties of raising children while managing a career as a flight attendant.


Last Check Before Moving In
LEAD: JUST before a buyer takes title to a brand-new home, either a condominium or a single-family house, the builder normally arranges for a final inspection of the property to verify that everything is in order.
Many buyers are perplexed by this ritual and do not understand what they should be examining and why.


RESIDENTS OPPOSE CONDOMINIUM PLAN
LEAD: THE town of Greenburgh made an unusual proposal last summer - to switch two-thirds of its commercial zoning on 450 acres at 15 sites to residential use.
It would do this in the hope of gaining some moderate-priced housing instead of more offices and hotels.


Bad Blood
LEAD: Carlos Lehder Rivas, reputedly one of the world's most dangerous billionaires, was captured by authorities in Colombia last week and extradited to the United States to face a long list of drug-related charges in two Federal courts in Florida.
Mr.
Lehder, who was said by prosecutors to be part of a ring responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States, was indicted three months ago in Miami on charges of conspiring to ship 58 pounds of cocaine into Florida.


HOW TO PUT UP SHELVES AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE LEVEL

LEAD: The engagement of Elizabeth Anne Sovern to Raymond Ernest Conley has been announced by the parents of the future bride, Michael I. Sovern of New York and Lenore Sanders of Huntington Beach, Calif.
A June wedding is planned.
Ms.
Sovern, an associate producer in New York of ABC's ''World News Tonight'' with Peter Jennings, graduated cum laude from Barnard College.


CORRECTION
LEAD: An article last Sunday about portfolio insurance misstated the current affiliations of Hayne Leland and Mark Rubinstein.

POSTINGS: The City as Collector; Nostalgia for Sale
LEAD: The market for what is becoming known as urban archeology - an old Coca Cola sign or a 1930's refrigerator - continues to grow, and downtown galleries specializing in such merchandise help interior designers looking for kitsch or smoke-screened nostalgia.


OPEC May Stumble, But It Won't Fall
LEAD: EUPHORIA has overtaken the oil markets in recent weeks, as the OPEC agreement on production limits has demonstrated a surprising staying power.
Even the Soviet Union, never a particularly trustworthy partner in these matters, has promised to join the effort to scale back production.
And just this week, the four American oil companies that make up Aramco agreed to pay a fixed price of $18 a barrel.

LEAD: Prisoners who have been kept in solitary confinement for days and sometimes years have sued the state for violating their civil rights.


LOOKING FOR LINCOLN IN THE 1980'S
LEAD: AT the Gettysburg cemetery, the Abraham Lincoln of Gore Vidal's novel barely gets through his first sentence - about the events in America ''four score and seven years ago'' - when the young Presidential secretary, John Hay, cynically observes that such rhetoric ''will please the radicals.'' Though the national commitment to the noble notion that ''all men are created equal,'' particularly in its Civil War, black-white context, is thereby dismissed, the Gettysburg Ad-dress itself is not.


Ten Seized in Somalia Are Freed in Ethiopia
LEAD: Ten French medical workers in Somalia, who were captured two weeks ago by Ethiopian-backed rebels, were turned over to France here today.


NEW JERSEY JOURNAL
LEAD: THE state's Board of Public Utilities will not challenge a $7.7 million American Telephone and Telegraph Company rate increase that took effect last Sunday on long-distance calls made within New Jersey.


FRIENDLY ENEMIES
LEAD: Even in a game that evinces as much individualism as chess, there are times when rivalries are put aside for the sake of reciprocal benefit.
Suppose you come up with the kernel for an original tactic in a complicated, heavily studied opening position?


WARNING OF SWANS
LEAD: Thank you for publishing my letter in the Jan. 18 issue of Connecticut Weekly.
However, I wish to point out an error in the printed letter.

ROSTROPOVICH LEADS NATIONAL SYMPHONY AT CARNEGIE
LEAD: WHEN Mstislav Rostropovich and the National Symphony Orchestra are good, they are very, very good, and they are often at their best in the music of Shostakovich.
On Friday night, the orchestra played one of Shostakovich's least known works -the Symphony No. 4 in C minor (Op. 43), written in 1935-36 at the height of the ''great terror'' and immediately after Stalin had denounced the young composer for his ''formalism'' and for writing ''muddle instead of music.


CORRECTION
LEAD: In last week's column, a computer malfunction caused question marks to appear in several places in the game score.
All but one appeared where a dash should have been; one, however, made White's 12th move unitelligible; the move should have been B-N3.


GANDHI ACTIONS STIR STRONG CRITICISM
LEAD: A flurry of personnel shifts, statements and actions by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, including some related to India's latest confrontation with Pakistan, have prompted unusually strong criticism of his performance.


GATES FINDS C.I.A. BESET BY PROBLEMS
LEAD: SOME agencies in this city gain prominence because of what they do, others because of whom their leaders know.
In the last six years, under William J. Casey, President Reagan's close friend, the Central Intelligence Agency achieved new influence for both reasons.
But that very power has contributed to a long list of potentially difficult problems that his newly nominated successor must face - without the benefit of Mr.

ANTIOCH TEETERING ON PERILOUS EDGE
LEAD: ''Question Authority,'' the command of an irreverent, red-lettered bumper sticker from other days, is securely stuck to the front wall of the largest classroom at the Antioch Law School here, too high over the gritty, paint-peeled lecture hall to be removed without a ladder.


IN SEARCH OF THE ISLAND'S PULSE

THE LIFE OF A 'SNOWBIRD'
LEAD: I am appalled that you printed the article by Carol Cott Gross on Jan. 11  [ ''Rules for the Florida Visit,'' Opinion Page ] .
I think she shows lack of compassion and understanding for older (and probably other) people, and what is supposed to be humorous, I find callous and hurtful.
I find no redeeming feature in this article.


ON CAMPAIGN FINANCING
LEAD: With political campaigns becoming ever more expensive and political action committees proliferating, the current Congress may now be willing to give serious consideration to extending public campaign financing to the Congressional level.


The Rewards of Buying Frequent-Flier Awards
LEAD: If you telephone American Airlines and buy a round-trip ticket from New York to Honolulu, it will cost at least $598.
At that rock-bottom rate, you would have to make your reservations and pay for your ticket at least 21 days before departure, you could travel only on a Tuesday or Wednesday and you could not make any stopovers on the way.


Mark S. Marani Wed To Judith F. Edwards
LEAD: Judith Ferguson Edwards, the daughter of Mrs.

Henry C. Duncan, a Methodist minister, performed the ceremony at the Village Chapel in


A 'SHARK WATCHER' ON WALL STREET
LEAD: ''I WAS the first shark watcher,'' said Arnold Minsky of Brookville.
But don't look for the 48-year-old Mr.
Minsky in the waters off Montauk, chumming for great whites.
Look for him - figuratively speaking - on Wall Street, trolling for the sort of sharks inclined to feed on stock as they raid tempting targets in corporate takeovers.


WEAK DOLLAR FRAYS SAUDI TIES TO U.S.
LEAD: THE hints of the worsening relations between Saudi Arabia and the United States were apparent the moment James A. Baker, the Treasury Secretary, stepped off his plane into the marble-covered royal entrance of the world's biggest airport.
Although the airport was designed by Americans, nearly all its equipment came from other countries.

WINTER'S GLOOM? NO, WINTER'S GIFTS
LEAD: A WINTER'S day, the stillness, the quiet all down the length of Jericho Turnpike, a feeling of bleakness as the seasons turn - to some, these bring complaints of winter's gloom; to me, they bring winter's gifts.
Among these gifts is a sense of a return to another time when vast stretches of Long Island's turnpikes were empty roads leading to land that was still free of concrete, still being turned by the farmer's hand.


SEOUL POLICE CLASH WITH DEMONSTRATORS
LEAD: Despite a Government effort to block them, thousands of demonstrators gathered here Saturday to mourn the death by torture of a 21-year-old student three weeks ago.

POP: THE HUMAN LEAGUE PLAYS THE RITZ
LEAD: Take yesterday's disco rhythms, add a slightly flat British singer, and the result can be a pop hit.

STUDENT PARKING ON GREAT NECK
LEAD: As a 1985 graduate of Great Neck North High School, I feel it is appropriate for me to respond to ''No Parking.'' What exactly is the issue addressed?

Mattingly-Rice I
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:  Don Mattingly is a great baseball player, clearly the dominant figure in his sport and surely worth $2 million of George Steinbrenner's money.
But let's not get carried away.


POSTINGS: Slips for $30,000; Sail Ho! Condo
LEAD: For the future residents of Seaport - a condominium development planned for Toms River, N.J. - returning home won't mean fighting for a parking space, but rather hoisting the centerboard, cleating the bow line and hosing down the deck.


WHAT'S NEW IN MASSAGE
LEAD: DON'T say ''masseuse.'' Massage practitioners who are moving their vocation into the mainstream say the term has unfortunate associations with prostitution.
They prefer ''massage therapist'' or ''bodywork practitioner.''


BUCKING THE ODDS IN LAS VEGAS
LEAD: We timed our trip West to arrive in Las Vegas on Friday the 13th.
Starting out in Santa Fe on the 5th, we made our way by car to Albuquerque, Gallup, Canyon de Chelly, deep in the 16.5 million-acre Navajo reservation, the Grand Canyon and, finally, Vegas, where I proposed to defy portents and not lose my shirt, particularly the one with the emblem, Universidad de New Mexico, which I had picked up at the school's bustling

EDINBURGH OFF SEASON
LEAD: Waking early on a winter morning in Edinburgh, you may see stone pavements glistening under street lamps as cars and red double-deckers rumble along Princes Street, Princes Street's gardens a watery green despite overcoat weather.

VIEWS AND OVERVIEWS OF MUSEUM DESIGN

Architecture View; CROWDING CAN VITIATE DESIGN -- GOOD AND BAD
LEAD: In the ever-mounting struggle between a livable city and the real-estate industry's relentless desire to fill every nook and cranny of midtown Manhattan with a skyscraper, even a well-designed building can be a mixed blessing.
A handsome object, in other words, is not in and of itself enough to justify more crowding, more shadows, and more pressure in a part of the city that is already bursting at the seams.


HOW TO PUT UP SHELVES AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE LEVEL

Smoking
LEAD: To the Editor:  Frederick Thayer  [ Letters, Jan. 18 ]  says that when the Environmental Protection Agency and the Surgeon General join hands to argue that environmental tobacco smoke is a danger to non-smokers, the public should suspect a conspiracy.

Hershiser Is Loser
LEAD: FOLLOWING a season in which his victory total dropped by five games and his loss total increased by 11, Orel Hershiser, the Los Angeles Dodgers' pitcher who last year won a record pay raise in salary arbitration, established an opposite kind of record yesterday: He suffered the largest pay cut ever allowed in arbitration.

Gentrification: The Case of Clinton Hill
LEAD: THERE is always human and political turmoil when a city neighborhood is being retrieved from abandonment and decay and, in this regard, the Clinton Hill section of downtown Brooklyn is no exception.
But unlike other minority neighborhoods that have been overrun by middle-income whites in search of affordable housing, Clinton Hill has been propelled into gentrification by an integrated mix of middle-income New


WHAT'S NEW IN MASSAGE
LEAD: THOUGH there are hundreds of massage schools nationwide, one obstacle to massage's acceptance in medicine -and in mainstream America - has been a lack of accreditation standards.

RECITAL: KIMBALL WHEELER
LEAD: KIMBALL WHEELER'S recital at Merkin Concert Hall Wednesday night offered decent, professional-level music-making, amplified considerably by glamour and personal charm.
Ms.
Wheeler possesses a mezzo-soprano voice of moderate size, dark hue and naturally affecting timbre.
Unfortunately, on Wednesday night her upper register was not secure, her pitch sense lacked authority, and her interpretations were careful rather than inspired.

LEAD: ALESSANDRO MENDINI, an Italian architect and editor, and Sinya Okayama, a Japanese designer, worked together when they had furniture exhibitions in Milan and Tokyo in 1984 and 1985.

LEAD: ONE of the longest-running cabaret hits in New York is ''Forbidden Broadway,'' the award-winning musical spoof of the people and the shows that dominate Broadway news.

JAPANESE WITH CHARM AND VALUE

One of the oldest, Hatsune in New Haven, is not only going strong, but has also, for the most part, sustained the high level of achievement reached in its early days.


Handily Done
LEAD: BEAUTIFUL craftsmanship is a rare commodity these days, given the dearth of trained talent as well as the high cost of labor and materials.
But when the occasional project arises in which machine-age techniques cannot possibly equal what is wrought by hand, there thankfully exists a small group of artisans carrying out their trade with the high standards that were considered commonplace generations ago.


MULTIPLE OFFERINGS SOUTH OF THE BORDER
LEAD: THE ever-increasing number and variety of first-rate musical events in the county continue to be a boon to music lovers who prefer not to fight the traffic, parking and sundry other problems that go with concert attendance in mid-Manhattan.
Events in the Bronx, on the other hand, are usually closer and more convenient.


COPING WITH THE NEXT CALAMITY
LEAD: LAST month was crisis time again in Gotham.
The Long Island Rail Road went on strike, just in time for the severe snowstorm to hit, which, of course, meant the airports closed and highway traffic snarled.

Seattle
LEAD: To members of a loosely knit group called Lesser Seattle - dedicated in humor to keeping the largest city of the Pacific Northwest tourist-free and underwhelmed - last year was a nightmare.
Vancouver's Expo 86, a few hours to the north, and a shower of superlatives from several national travel guides helped to bring a record number of visitors to the far edge of America.

7TH AVENUE LEADS TO PETTICOAT JUNCTION
LEAD: WHO says fashion designers don't have a sense of humor?

WHAT MAKES HOLLYWOOD BID BIG FOR A HOT NOVEL
LEAD: The manuscript of ''Presumed Innocent,'' which was about to become the object of one of the most frenzied bidding wars in recent Hollywood memory, arrived in Los Angeles on Nov. 6, 1986, by Federal Express.

KEEPING STATE PARKS GREEN AS FEDERAL FUNDS DWINDLE
LEAD: ''IN the early 1980's, we were hurt quite a bit by cutbacks from Federal sources,'' recalled Gregory Iffrig, director of administration for Missouri's division of parks.
The cuts came, he noted, not only in direct grants-in-aid, but also in work programs like the Youth Conservation Corps, which Missouri depended on for help in the upkeep of its 103,000 acres of public recreation and wilderness land.


ONE MORE SEASON FOR ABDUL JABBAR

A September wedding is planned.


BEYOND THE PALE WITH EDGAR ALLAN POE
LEAD: ANYONE aware of the difficulties of Edgar Allan Poe's life must wish to see his reputation prosper.
Yet he alone among the Immortals calls up the sort of smirk otherwise reserved for writers who are not only living but also local.
Anyone who confesses an admiration for Poe learns quickly that he is not respectable, because he set out to create powerful responses in his readers by methods already conventional when he used them.


HOT AND BOTHERED IN PARIS AND LONDON

LEAD: In Chicago, it used to be routine police practice to sweep up large numbers of young black and Hispanic men on disorderly conduct charges, hold them overnight and release them the next day without prosecution.
In 1982, the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the practice in Federal court.
In 1983, when Harold Washington took over as Chicago's first black mayor, the city entered into a consent decree to end the sweeps.


Science On the Track of God
LEAD: In his article ''Science on the Track of God'' (Jan. 4), James Gleick searches for ''the evidence of design that cannot be explained away,'' and seems frustrated because ''science does eventually manage to explain.'' There is some confusion here, and it revolves around the word ''explanation.'' Science is made up of theories.


JAPANESE SET SAIL FOR THE CUP
LEAD: SLEEK and shiny, the futuristic yacht with the Japanese flag appeared to have arrived from a James Bond movie.
Maybe you noticed it on television just before the start of the second America's Cup race when Stars &amp; Stripes and Kookaburra III sailed around it.
Another few feet and it would have created an international incident.


PLIGHT OF A SURROGATE COMPLAINER
LEAD: NAN, a neighbor, and I love freezing in April on a beach in Maine (getting a so-called tan), shopping for Christmas on Labor Day, and having icicle duels with our respective husbands in deep winter.

Except for one thing: Nan can't complain about anything, so I do all the complaining for her.

ALIENS IN U.S. GAIN REFUGE IN CANADA
LEAD: Illegal aliens who are not eligible for legal status under the new immigration law are migrating from the United States to Canada in substantial numbers.


M.C.I. Increases
LEAD: To the Editor:  Your article called the ''Vanishing Supply of Rentals'' on Dec. 28 quotes an executive of a realty management firm complaining about the 6 percent cap on M.C.I. rent increases as a disincentive to landlords contemplating major capital improvements to a building.
He felt that way since a 6 percent increase of an average $500 rental would be only $1,800 over the course of the 5-year amortization period that is used (6 percent times $500 times 60 months).


POSTINGS: Showcase for 96th; Restoring a Gem
LEAD: Everything about the mansion built in 1915 for Lucy D. Dahlgren at 15 East 96th Street is decorative - from the Beaux Arts-style facade, replete with carved swags and an intricate wrought-iron balcony, to the grand marble staircase and octagonal dining room with two marble fountains.

WOODED TRACT STIRS DISPUTTE

It may be that enough has changed so that I can live here.''  - Sergei Grigoryants, newly released from a Soviet prison.  [ 10:1. ]


SOME PRUNES CAN BE SHOW STOPPERS
LEAD: WHY is it we hate prunes so much when we are children?
Perhaps it is because they show up in such unflattering circumstances: stewed and served on top of cereal, or with custard for dessert.
But prunes are transformed when they become adult food.
They go wonderfully with rich winter meats such as pork, venison, duck or goose, and even with chicken or veal.


GERMAN RUNS 35-YEAR SHOW OF TALK ON TV
LEAD: If Werner Hofer had had his way, he would never have become the most famous television personality in West Germany.

LEAD: Boston's depressed theater district, where pornographic movie houses outnumber cultural outlets and show tickets are sold from a dilapidated trailer, will be transformed into a busy center of dance, music and theater within the next five years, city officials say.


TRAVELS WITH LEAHY
LEAD: Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, freely admits that he knows ''a lot more about the problems of dairy farmers than wheat, corn and soybean growers or farmers who raise livestock.'' Since Mr.

NEW FT. DRUM DIVISION ADDS TO HOUSING PRESSURE

The Venetian Maskmakers' Art Revived
LEAD: Venice will always be a city of mystery and intrigue, just as she was in those last desperate days of the Most Serene Republic at the close of the 18th century.
One has only to walk her splendid fondamenti (canal walkways) or cross her magic bridges counting the shadows after nightfall to know that much.


A JUNKYARD THAT'S EVER SO NEAT
LEAD: MOST people think of junkyards as unwholesome eyesores of smashed metal, glass and rubber in such clutter that nobody could ever know where anything is, but most people are not Wayne Bunting and James Ruocco.


107 G.O.P. MILLIONS DIDN'T SAVE SENATE
LEAD: Republican candidates for the United States Senate raised $28 million more than their Democratic opponents in the 1986 election, but those funds were not a determining factor in most races, an analysis of campaign finance reports shows.

LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
LEAD: THE DUCK AT THE DOOR FROM the outside, Susan Rosenberg's home in Merrick looks like many suburban split-levels.

ACTION IS CALLED FOR ON ELECTRIC RATES
LEAD: I read, with great interest, your article ''Power Cost Is Down but Still an Issue''  [ Jan. 18 ] .
Although I agree that with electric rates down in 1986, the push for cheaper power has lost some momentum, I feel that the fight for reduced Con Ed bills must go on.
We pay the highest rates in the nation.


KEEPING TAINED FOODS OFF THIRD WORLD SHELVES
LEAD: BAVARIA'S Minister of Agriculture tasted the milk last week and proclaimed it safe.
The West German Environment Minister was less confident, saying that it would cause no harm ''unless it entered the food chain.'' Whatever the exact nature of the danger, 3,000 tons of radioactive powdered milk, a legacy of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster 10 months ago, has led to bitter feelings between West

Art
LEAD: Just a week remains in which to see the exhibition of oils, watercolors and drawings by Oskar Kokoschka (1886-1980) at the Guggenheim Museum.
Just before World War I, Kokoschka was one of the most conspicuous young artists in the Vienna that has lately become so fashionable.
In Dresden, between 1917 and 1923, he painted landscapes and figure subjects that are among the glories of German art.


WHAT'S NEW IN MASSAGE
LEAD: WHEN Apple Computer Inc. was developing its Macintosh personal computer, engineers on the project sported T-shirts that boasted: ''Working 90 hours a week and loving it!''


WHAT COURTS SHOULD DO: 1905 DEBATE
LEAD: The case was limited, but Lochner v.

GARY GARFINKEL  Long Island City, Queens


DO YOU LIKE THE COLLEGE 3-POINT BASKET?
LEAD: The college game, unlike professional basketball, has never suffered the sort of slump warranting significant rule changes.
Moreover, even if such rule changes were necessary in college basketball, the current 3-point rule would still be inappropriate.

LEAD: Plans to stage a mock surprise attack on a group of Jewish teen-agers to dramatize the dangers of terrorism were discarded Friday after objections by parents and the Israeli Consulate to surprising the children.


NEW ALBION: NEW LABEL FOR NEW MUSIC
LEAD: As most major record companies continue to shrink away from even a token commitment to contemporary music, we must rely increasingly on smaller labels to document the sounds of our time.

ON STAGE, LETTERS FORM THE LITERATI
LEAD: These Amazons now showed themselves qualified for the duty even of foot-soldiers; they stood there till 5 in the afternoon, without either sustenance or evacuation, every now and then playing volleys of thumps, kicks and raps, against the door, with so much violence that the speakers in the House were scarce heard.


NEWS SUMMARY: SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1987

DO YOU LIKE THE COLLEGE 3-POINT BASKET?
LEAD: Yes, but - only if you complete the adjustment by establishing a 1-point zone round the basket.
This would reduce the ridiculous priority on height and restore emphasis on skills.
The 3-point play is an important first step of the two steps needed.
MARTIN LENTZ  Philadelphia

MUSIC: PHILHARMONIC IN WORK BY MATTHUS
LEAD: THE novelty on the New York Philharmonic's current program, which this listener heard Friday afternoon, was a concerto for orchestra by the East German composer Siegfried Matthus.
Entitled ''Die Windsbraut'' (The Bride of the Wind), this 15-minute piece in four movements played without pause belongs to a genre of symphonic work that might be described, not without honor, as ''weather music.

Science On the Track of God
LEAD: The concept of scientific inquiry as a path toward knowledge of God is intriguing, if not new.
Thomas Paine put forth the idea some 200 years ago in concluding his pamphlet ''The Age of Reason.'' Even he may not have been the first to do so.
More interesting yet is Mr.
Gleick's attention to the issue of elegant mathematics and great musical works - i.e.

LEAD: HEALTH-CARE costs are of vital concern to us all.
As physicians, we recognize the public's desire that waste be eliminated and duplication minimized in the provision of hospital services.

Forecasting Prices in Manhattan
LEAD: CAN an econometric model predict how resale prices in Manhattan residential real estate will rise or fall?

BIRD AND JORDAN DO WHAT'S EXPECTED

LEAD: To the Editor:  Your article titled ''Rebuilding From the Grass Roots Up'' on Dec. 21 mentions that homes on a redeveloped Charlotte Street in the South Bronx will be sold for $100,000.
It then states that these are ''low- and moderate-income projects.'' Since when are $100,000 houses classified as low- and moderate-income?


BUSINESS GETS LONG-DISTANCE BREAK
LEAD: OVERALL, the average cost of placing a long-distance call has declined about 30 percent since the breakup of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company in 1984, according to the Federal Communications Commission.

Court Finds for Farm Workers
LEAD: Saying that Labor Secretary Bill Brock's decision to require the states to issue field sanitation standards for farm workers was an abdication of authority based on a faulty view of federalism, a three-judge panel in Washington last week ordered the Labor Department to issue Federal guidelines that farm worker advocates have been petitioning or suing for since 1972.

NATURE'S CONTROLS ON SWAN POPULATION
LEAD: I am responding to Shirley Becker's letter to the editor  [ ''Let Nature Take Care of Swans,'' Jan. 18 ]  regarding the Jan. 4 article ''Controls on Swans Proposed.'' I share her love of swans, but her conclusion to ''let nature take care of overpopulation'' may be a bit naive.
Will nature be able to take care of the overpopulation?


NEWEST JUDICIAL ACTIVISTS COME FROM THE RIGHT
LEAD: AS the prominence of conservative legal thinkers has grown during the Reagan Administration, so has a split about the fundamental issues of constitutional jurisprudence.
The division centers on whether judges should take the activist role of striking down a wide range of economic regulations.


CRIME
LEAD: It was about a dozen years ago that the Australian writer William Marshall started writing his Yellowthread Street mysteries.
Those were procedurals set in Hong Kong, and were distinguished by a wacky kind of writing in which seriousness was mingled with farce.
There have been 11 in that series.

LEAD: To the Editor:


'WHERE TWO WORLDS MEET'
LEAD: On behalf of the Young Israel of Lawrence-Cedarhurst, the most rapidly growing Orthodox synagogue in the Five Towns, we wish to thank you for an incisive, positive, portrayal of our community  [ ''Five Towns: Where Two Worlds Meet,'' Dec. 28 ] .

SOME PRUNES CAN BE SHOW STOPPERS
LEAD: WHY is it we hate prunes so much when we are children?
Perhaps it is because they show up in such unflattering circumstances: stewed and served on top of cereal, or with custard for dessert.
But prunes are transformed when they become adult food.
They go wonderfully with rich winter meats such as pork, venison, duck or goose, and even with chicken or veal.


Westminster Blends Tradition and Quality
LEAD: Westminster, the most prestigious of the more than 1,000 all-breed dog shows held annually in the United States, opens a two-day run at Madison Square Garden tomorrow.


The Istanbul Synagogue Massacre
LEAD: There was one relevant fact that caught my attention precisely because it didn't appear in Judith Miller's article: if Ankara knew of Iran's probable involvement in the attack on the synagogue, then United States Government agencies knew, and if Washington knew, then Jerusalem also knew.


Alison K. Plotsky Weds D.S. Brown
LEAD: Alison Katherine Plotsky, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.

LEAD: Day by day, the news exposes a deep and dangerous dimension to the Iran-contra crisis: privatized diplomacy.


METS TROUBLES REFLECT PRESSURIZED LIVES
LEAD: RECENT accounts in the popular press of personal and legal problems encountered by a select number of the Mets have once again caused confusion for the typical fan.
A national study conducted three years ago showed that 64 percent of American families have children participating in some organized sport and they tend to see sports heroes as persons with some of the most highly prized human qualities.


JEWELS OF WINDSOR
LEAD: ALL CONVERSATION CEASED at a sumptuous Paris ball when the Duchess of Windsor made her entrance.
It was 1957, and the Duchess was wearing a dazzling necklace, composed of rows of large cabochon emeralds and diamonds, which everyone in the room began loudly admiring.

What will she do or, for that matter, what should she do?

AMERICAN MUSIC FOR PIANO IS FOCUS IN RECENT DISKS
LEAD: One of the three or four most satisfying piano recitals to come this critic's way in the last few seasons was Peter Serkin's at the 92d St.
Y, and now the best parts of it are represented on a new recording for New World Records (NW 344).
Those are the knotty, intense Passacaglia (1936) of Stefan Wolpe, a work of steadily accumulating power; two clean-lined and inevitable sounding Stravinsky performances, and an engaging new three-part work by Peter Lieberson called ''Bagatelles.


Blue Blood
LEAD: When two descendants of royalty fought it out recently for the mayoralty of Palm Beach, Fla., the main issue appeared to be which of them had the most common touch.


ALBANY TV STATION CANCELS NBC SHOW OVER CONDOM ISSUE
LEAD: The NBC-TV affiliate in Albany, WNYT, has canceled its Sunday broadcast of the situation comedy ''Valerie'' because the episode deals with condoms, a network spokesman said.
Three other stations, including WVIT in West Hartford, Conn., are delaying the broadcast beyond prime time.


Naming Names In the Bronx
LEAD: In many political domains, nomination is tantamount to election; in the Bronx, it is beginning to seem that election is tantamount to investigation.


THE YOUNGEST OLD-TIMER
LEAD: DONALD WATTS still shaves his head, and wears a thick headband on the court, making him look like the planet Saturn in sneakers.
At the Dunlap Elementary School in Seattle, his name is Mr.
Watts, but yesterday, for a few hours, he was Slick Watts again.


THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER
LEAD: COMPACT disks have taken the world of recorded music by storm.
Their promise in personal computing, however, has failed to materialize.
The difference in public acceptance is due in large part to time.


U.S. ASKING ROOM FOR 'BABY BELLS' TO GROW
LEAD: FIVE years ago, in a move that was both surprising and tentative, the Justice Department and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company settled on a way to break up the Bell System's decades-old monopoly of the nation's telephone business.
Now the Reagan Administration is offering proposals that would create a handful of miniature A.T.&amp; T.

TWO MAJOR PIANISTS JOIN IN SOME ELEGANT MUSIC-MAKING
LEAD: Playing piano four hands -that is, four hands at one piano - is part of the growing up of many musicians.
In earlier days, before radio, records and television, it was also an integral part of the education of every music-lover.
All symphonic and chamber music was published in four-hand versions so that amateur and professional alike could become familiar with the content of the scores, Most four-hand music, aimed at the amateur as it was, did not need a virtuoso technique.


...AND TO THE ISLAND THAT WE CALL HOME
LEAD: WITH cupids and lace and big chocolate hearts, I ask Long Island to be my valentine forever.
After spending countless frantic weekends in the city, shopping for holiday gifts in the stores that line Fifth Avenue and desperately trying to hail cabs on frigid days, I bid a fond but definitely happy adieu to the Big

DIDION &amp; DUNNE: THE REWARDS OF A LITERARY MARRIAGE
LEAD: SHE'S SO THIN THAT IF YOU touch her back you can feel the ribs, like ridges on a roll-top desk.
He has a paunch.
She likes to sit on a stool, her back ramrod straight; he drapes his body across a couch, assuming a languid, informal pose.
She moves slowly, gently; talks softly.
He moves quickly, his eyes alert to danger or intrigue, his voice booming with good humor, spiked by the energy of a hair-trigger temper.

Incident in the Park
LEAD: MY FIRST memory was walking down the hill in a daze, my shirt torn and my face sticky with blood.
I thought it was odd to be walking, because I had a bike.
But I didn't have it now, although I had no idea why not.
I blundered down the road, the Central Park cyclists whizzing by me, and came upon a patrol car parked in an access road 50 feet away.

Aside from such mastodons of culture as the Louvre and the Grand Palais, Paris blossoms with small museums rich with art and offering fascinating curiosities in smaller doses.

Perhaps it is because they show up in such unflattering circumstances: stewed and served on top of cereal, or with custard for dessert.
But prunes are transformed when they become adult food.
They go wonderfully with rich winter meats such as pork, venison, duck or goose, and even with chicken or veal.

Sam Nunn's Rising Star
LEAD: Once more, we are treated to puffery of yet another macho-Democrat - Sam Nunn, whose philosophy amounts to Reaganism without Reagan.
Notably missing, by the way, is his sometime espousal of the draft, an electoral disaster at least as potent as any ''tax-and-spend'' tag.


Kathryn Toepfer to Wed H. R. Permut
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.

Claiborne And Cholesterol

LEAD: Gov.
Edwin Edwards, who was acquitted last year of Federal mail fraud and racketeering charges, announced Friday that he would seek a fourth term.

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: THE BRIDGE.
By Maggie Hemingway. (Atheneum, $13.95.) The jacket illustration for this imaginative first novel is a detail from a painting by the British impressionist Philip Steer.

During the 1880's Steer summered, mostly alone, in a tiny village on the Suffolk coast called Walberswick.


INVESTING
LEAD: SINCE 1983, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index has shamed many money managers.

MCENROE AND MAYOTTE ADVANCE TO FINAL
LEAD: John McEnroe would prefer that the line on the graph charting his progress was always moving upward, toward what he feels is his untapped potential.

HOSTAGES ENSNARED IN A WEB OF OLD BELIEFS AND MOSLEM HATREDS
LEAD: ON what began as a quiet December morning three years ago, a truck turned into the seafront American Embassy compound here, veered into an administration building and exploded.

RPO STARTS ITS OWN LABEL
LEAD: The Royal Philharmonic, like all the major British orchestras, is supported by private sponsors and government grants.
But when it comes to records, the RPO, like the others, has had to fend for itself, dealing with commercial record companies on a commercial basis.
Recently, however, the Royal Philharmonic decided it wanted to be able to call the tune, so to speak, on recordings, and formed its own record company, called, of course, RPO Records.

Cheaper Help does Better in Jay Bullpen
LEAD: IN the space of seven weeks two winters ago, the Toronto Blue Jays solved their glaring bullpen problem.
Or so they thought.
They staged a successful foray into the Bay Area and snatched Bill Caudill, right-hander, from the Oakland A's and Gary Lavelle, left-hander, from the San Francisco Giants.
Envisioning relief security for years to come, they committed themselves to spending a possible $9.8 million in salaries for the two established pitchers in the next five years.

LEAD: The fight over who gets to keep Baby M took a poignant turn last week when a New Jersey court heard a recording in which Mary Beth Whitehead, the surrogate mother, threatened to kill herself and the child.


When Social Security's Anti-Social
LEAD: Can America afford to acquire more land for national parks or retrain workers displaced by imports?
Can it pay for rebuilding the congested air traffic system or protecting South Africa's neighbors from economic collapse?

'ME AND MY GIRL' ON DISK CAPTURES GIDDY LILT OF SHOW
LEAD: Since it opened on Broadway last August, ''Me and My Girl'' has consistently effervesced at the box office to the tune of more than half a million dollars a week.
And the original Broadway cast album (MCA 6196; LP, cassette, compact disk) captures as much of the giddy lilt as a record could reasonably hope to extract from the champagne of nostalgia musicals.


STUDENT PARKING ON GREAT NECK
LEAD: The article about the problems that Great Neck North High School students have in finding parking spaces for their Mercedeses, Saab turbo convertibles and other sports cars distresses me greatly.
Other world problems - hunger, the Middle East conflict, arms control, etc. - are really rendered pale by comparison.


'BOARDER BABIES' BURDEN HOSPITALS

RITTER AND SELLECCA IN 'THE LAST FLING'
LEAD: IT'S all a matter of style. ''The Last Fling,'' tonight's television movie on ABC at 9, tries hard, and often rather amiably, to be what used to be known as a romantic romp.
Billy Wilder, in his ''Some Like It Hot'' period, would probably have pulled it off with great dollops of panache.
Television, insistently clumsy, gives us silliness that keeps toppling into stupidity.

LEAD: THERE seem to be a remarkable number of dancegoers with bronchitis at each performance of ''Moves,'' a ballet by Jerome Robbins that was presented by the New York City Ballet last Wednesday at the New York State Theater.
And the ballet's performers always seem to seethe coolly with emotion.
The reason seems to lie in the fact that the ballet is performed in silence.

THE STAGE: ARTHUR MILLER'S 'DANGER: MEMORY!'
LEAD: THE OPENING one-act play in ''Danger: Memory!,'' Arthur Miller's new double bill at Lincoln Center, is titled ''I Can't Remember Anything,'' but it's Arthur Miller's nature that he can never forget.
The horrors that haunt his characters today - the 20th century's police inquisitions, pogroms and wars - are the same specters that hung over ''After the Fall'' and ''Incident at Vichy,'' plays he wrote for the first Lincoln Center theater company, more than two decades ago.

Worse Than a Blunder: a Crime
LEAD: Blunder it assuredly was.
The Iran-contra arms crisis involved reckless ransoming of hostages and covertly funding the Nicaraguan rebels.

Rotation for Fed Panel
LEAD: This week's key meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee to establish monetary targets for 1987 will be the last before the panel's annual rotation of regional presidents occurs March 1.

MUSIC: CONTINUUM IN TRIBUTE TO IVES
LEAD: THE composer Charles Ives has been abundantly celebrated in recent years; as such, this listener found Continuum's program Saturday night at Alice Tully Hall, ''Ives the Visionary,'' somewhat less engaging than the group's usual performances.
At this point, Ives does not need Continuum's advocacy as much as do most of the composers the group takes on (recent concerts have been devoted to new music from Israel, the avant-garde in the Soviet Union, the music of Arvo Part, Alfred Schnittke and the man who elevated the player piano into the world of high Modernism, Conlon Nancarrow.)

PIANO: GUSTAVO ROMERO IN RECITAL DEBUT
LEAD: AN interesting and perhaps important debut recital took place at Alice Tully Hall on Wednesday night.
Gustavo Romero's choice of music was predictable, and it was cast in a predictably Romantic style.
But this young New York pianist has qualities that elevate him a little above the faceless musicality we have come to expect from such events.

New Haven: Yale University Press. $23.95.


BEIRUT REFUGEES'S PLIGHT TERMED GRIM DESPITE ARRIVAL OF AID
LEAD: Despite the arrival of some relief supplies in a besieged Palestinian refugee district here today, conditions in the district were described as desperate, with thousands of people suffering from malnutrition.


SURPRISE!
LEAD: THERE have been scores of horror stories told about them, including the most famous, and doubtless apocryphal, one about a couple being summoned downstairs of an evening by a telephone call reporting an emergency.
When they turned on the lights, they were greeted by a chorus of voices shouting ''surprise,'' but who was more surprised was moot because the couple had raced down without a stitch of clothing.


RIDING OUT SLUMPS IN A VOLATILE MARKET
LEAD: WALL Street's unprecedented surge has made a lot on investors very happy - and very nervous.
Those not content merely to take their gains and run are often forced to ride out the storms of a highly volatile market, hoping that the latest trough is not the start of a prolonged slump.
Some brokers argue that such investors can have their cake and eat it too, by hedging their portfolios with put options.


Chicha, Peru's Favorite Drink
LEAD: If you want to see how incomplete was Pizarro's conquest of the Incas, go to Cuzco.
Step inside the cathedral on the Plaza de Armas, walk past the altar of beaten silver with its monstrance of solid gold, and pause before a 17th-century painting of the Last Supper.
Here Jesus and his disciples sit down to a meal not of bread and wine, but of cuy and chicha - guinea pig and corn beer.


NON-MEXICANS SLIPPING INTO U.S.
LEAD: Last year there were about 1.6 million apprehensions of would-be illegal immigrants trying to cross the border between Mexico and the United States.

STRATEGISTS OFFER MARIO CUOMO SOME UNSOLICITED ADVICE
LEAD: AS speculation mounts about Mario M. Cuomo's potential Presidential candidacy, so, too, does the advice he receives - solicited or not -from around the country.

Carry the banner of the traditional liberal Democrat.


IRAN SALES LINKED TO WIDE PROGRAM OF COVERT POLICIES
LEAD: The Reagan Administration's clandestine dealings with Iran and the Nicaraguan rebels grew out of a well-concealed program established in the White House at least four years ago to conduct covert foreign policy initiatives, according to many present and former Government officials.


TWO DEAD IN BANGLADESH PROTESTS
LEAD: Riot police subduing an anti-Government demonstrator yesterday in Dhaka.
The protest was called to mourn the deaths of two students who died earlier in the day in the southern port city of Chittagong.
They were killed, and scores were injured, when five gasoline bombs were thrown at Moslem demonstrators.


POSTAGE-SIZE PROPAGANDA
LEAD: Buying arms from the West, waging a protracted war against Iraq, taking hostages - Iran is and has been very much in the news.
But Peter J. Chelkowski, professor of Near Eastern studies at New York University, has been interested in Iran for quite another reason.
He has been studying its stamps, and he's not a philatelist.


A GALLERY OF AMERICAN ORIGINALS
LEAD: AT the expo held across the street from the conference last weekend, the emphasis shifted to the inventions themselves and the inventors were as proud as students at a school science fair.


POSTINGS: 47 Town-House Units; New Co-op For Merrick
LEAD: Some 250 buses still roll in and out of the terminal in Merrick, L.I., run for the last 30 years by Harran Transportation Company.

New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  THE SACRED COW AND THE ABOMINABLE PIG: Riddles of Food and Culture, by Marvin Harris. (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $6.95.) Hindus won't eat beef, while Jews and Moslems avoid pork and Americans quake at the idea of consuming cockroaches, thought a delicacy in some cultures.
Marvin Harris examines the reasons people eat what they do in this book, originally titled ''Good to Eat.


TRAVELS OF A ROCK
LEAD: THE newest attraction at the Rockefeller State Park Preserve in North Tarrytown is a giant jagged chunk of rock at least 600 million years old.
This mass of free-standing gneiss, almost 20 feet high and 65 feet in circumference, is probably the largest ''glacial erratic'' to be found anywhere in the county.


COURT HANDS TEXACO A CHEAPER DEFEAT
LEAD: Texaco lost its appeal to get a $10.53 billion award to Pennzoil overturned, but the Texas appeals court reduced punitive damages to $1 billion, from $3 billion, making the total $8.5 billion, plus about $4 billion in interest.
The award had been for ''wrongful interference'' in a Pennzoil deal to acquire Getty in 1984.


ECONOMIC CRISIS ERODES SUPPORT FOR BRAZIL CHIEF
LEAD: A sudden souring of Brazil's economic situation has seriously eroded political and popular support for President Jose Sarney, tumbling the country into its worst crisis since civilian rule returned two years ago.


FOR WALL STREET, HANDCUFFS AND NEW PRESSURE
LEAD: With each new charge of insider trading, pressure is mounting in Washington to legislate a policing structure to compensate for what some on Capitol Hill are calling ''a real breakdown in the self-regulatory mechanisms on Wall Street.'' Last week's events, which stunned even the traders who had been talking for months about shoes dropping, are only expected to heighten the sense of urgency.


AMERICAN,S SCULPTURE WILL TOP WEST BERLIN GATE
LEAD: BUILT in 1907 in honor of King Frederick I of Prussia, almost destroyed by Adolf Hitler in the 1930's and by Allied air raids in the 1940's, and partially restored in the 1960's, the Charlottenburg Gate in West Berlin reflects the rich and turbulent history of the city.
Now the Baroque-styled gate is to be embellished with modern art,

LEAD: THE absence of one of the most prized food fish from this area, the Atlantic striped bass, is to be lamented.
Levels of PCB's in the fish led to a Government ban.
What is the cook to do?


CLIMB AND TELL OR, IT'S A LONG WAY FROM ANNAPURNA
LEAD: THE dispatches of those who returned from exotic mountain ranges used to sound pretty much the same, waxing expansive on the fellowship and courage exhibited during some bold gamble in which everyone behaved marvelously.
Even a saga as exciting as ''Annapurna,'' the story of the 1950 French ascent of that treacherous 26,504-foot-high Himalayan peak, celebrated selflessness, as when the veteran mountaineer Lionel Terray yielded&gt;ju his chance at the summit to the author, Maurice


Two Killed and One Wounded In Bronx Apartment Shooting
LEAD: A man and a woman were killed and another man was critically wounded in what was believed to be a drug-related shooting in an apartment in the Bronx, the police reported yesterday.


IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: HIDDEN SYMPTOMS.
By Deirdre Madden. (Atlantic Monthly, $14.95.) Although Deirdre Madden's first novel is set in Belfast in 1969, it is more about familial love than Ireland's political struggles.
In her view, however, the two are united: the loyalties between parents and children can easily be perverted into the sectarian hatreds that divide the country.


WHAT THE L.I.R.R. STRIKE DID TO MY MARRIAGE
LEAD: IT was the answer to a housewife's prayer.


TOPICS: Urban Rites; Spring Chicken
LEAD: February brought a Brooklyn woman daffodil leaves standing up a couple of inches in her garden -since frozen - a pair of black and white ladderbacked downy woodpeckers and, best of all, a rooster gorgeously appointed with red cockscomb, full rufous ruff, red feathers shading into iridescent greens toward the tail.


IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: BRUISED FRUIT.
By Amy Ephron. (Doubleday, $13.95.) Perhaps to differentiate herself from the bittersweet comic writing practiced by her sisters Nora and Delia, Amy Ephron has gone in another direction - toward bittersweet tragic writing.
Her second novel, ''Bruised Fruit,'' is composed of the sort of affectless prose associated with stories about disengaged women by writers like Jean Rhys.


THE UNSEEN WOMAN
LEAD: ALL my life I've had this little problem.
I seem to be invisible.
When I look in the mirror, a wide-eyed woman stares back at me, but in groups I'm unnoticed.
No, it's worse than that; I'd say unpresent.


The Dash of Clash
LEAD: Perhaps it's a reaction to the jangle of life - fashion is often identified as a mirror to the times.
But whatever the incentive, there is a blast of brash design for spring.
Realized mostly in accessories, but also in some clothes, this gust consists of vivid combinations of colors, mismatched patterns or punchy shapes and appliques -even all three.


POSTINGS: Tug-of-War on Staten Island; A Battle for a Colony of Condominiums
LEAD: A former Augustinian academy that later became a retreat house -a sprawling Spanish-style structure in the Grymes Hill section of Staten Island - once epitomized tranquility.

New York: Viking. $18.95.


CHANGERS FOR CD'S GIVE MUSIC BY THE DAY
LEAD: Were special honors to be awarded for dubious achievements, the new compact-disk changers would rank among the leading contenders.
Spinning stacks of CD's for hours on end, they stretch out the music beyond anyone's attention span and make it all seem vapid.
Hailed for their nearly interminable running time, these longwinded changers are the culmination of a trend that - up to a point - made sense.


NUCLEAR TESTS ARE TERMED IRREPLACEABLE
LEAD: A top official of a Federal laboratory for the design of nuclear weapons said today that no computer simulations, however advanced or powerful, could ever replace the need for the explosive testing of nuclear arms beneath the earth.

U.S. BILL PROPOSES LEAVES FOR CHILD CARE
LEAD: AS Congress considers legislation aimed at protecting the nation's families, a measure that would guarantee unpaid leave for parents to care for their children is expected to become a hotly debated issue.


ON BLOCKING EXTRA PAY
LEAD: Ralph Nader's public interest lobby and legal agency, Public Citizen, is pondering legal action to try to block the pay increases that recently took effect for members of Congress, Federal judges and senior Government officials.
But its lawyers are in a quandary over how to do it.
One of the problems is that any lawsuit would almost inevitably be decided by a judge whose own raise could well depend on his own ruling.


DEBORAH T. HICKS TO MARRY IN MAY
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
David Milton Hicks of Jacksonville, Fla., have announced the engagement of their daughter Deborah Tyler Hicks to Stephen Renato Quazzo, a son of Jacqueline Stamato of Essex Fells, N.J., and Rome and Ugo Quazzo of New York and Chester, Vt.

CARNIVAL IN AUSSEERLAND
LEAD: At carnival time in the Ausseerland, the lake district of Austria, nobody goes to school or work for three whole days.

NEW NICHE: GRAFFITI REMOVAL
LEAD: IF there are those in New Rochelle seeking the fame that came to Keith Haring as a so- called graffiti artist, chances are that they will remain unknown.


IN ADDING TO THE GUGGENHEIM, A LITTLE LESS GOES A LONG WAY
LEAD: Those who believe that the Guggenheim Museum should have no addition whatsoever - that to tamper with Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpiece in any fashion would be akin to adding a few square inches to one of the Picassos or Braques that repose within it - will not be satisfied with the museum's latest plan, announced last week.


ORCHESTRA NEW ENGLAND IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE

FARM HOLIDAY FINNISH STYLE, IN WISCONSIN

COSTLY REVERSAL OF A U.S. PROJECT
LEAD: A $150 million plan was under consideration in Florida last year to make a river crooked again after the Federal Government had spent $21 million to make it straight.


Guitar: Pedro Baez, Latin-American Works
LEAD: THE Argentine guitarist Pedro Baez, who presented a program of Latin-American music at Weill Recital Hall Friday night, is better with ''the big picture'' than he is with small details.
His playing has a certain scope and formal grandeur - his interpretations have beginnings, middles and endings, and one rarely forgets where one is.


DARIO THEN AND NOW
LEAD: To the Editor:


TARKANIAN CASE: LONG ROAD NEARS END
LEAD: IT would be incorrect to say that either Jerry Tarkanian or officials at the National Collegiate Athletic Association have been waiting with bated breath for the outcome of a lawsuit involving them.
If they were, they would have turned blue long ago.

LEAD: A woman barred from serving on a jury because she is deaf has sued the Blair County judge who dismissed her, alleging she was a victim of discrimination.


NEXT WAVE TRUNS A NEW CORNER
LEAD: With its sixth season recently completed, the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival - the most publicized and popular American showcase for the new performing arts - is making plans that include more emphasis on European dance companies and increased roles for theater and opera.
Very visibly at the peak of its success, the festival - it was called a series in 1981 and 1982, rechristened a festival in 1983 - appears to be at a turning point.


Q and A
LEAD: Motor-Home Trip  Question: Would it be possible to rent a trailer in San Diego large enough for two people (both 65) and leave it in Seattle?
How can we make arrangements for such a tour? -A.

TALENT CAN CERTAINLY HELP, BUT A HIGH E.Q. IS ESSENTIAL
LEAD: For ordinary success in music, almost everyone would agree, irreducible amounts of talent and training are important.
But for extraordinary, flabbergasting success, nothing can take the place of a high E.Q., or Exploitability Quotient.
Some musicians come by a high E.Q. naturally, some acquire it through diligent study and yet others have it thrust upon them by canny managers.


Revving Up
LEAD: WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT VIDEO GAMES - the sport of cola-swigging adolescents - would find a place in the ascetic, achievement-oriented world of beauty and fitness?
With their promise of motivating, entertaining and amusing body-conscious exercisers, the new electronic fitness equipment is nudging jump ropes and stationary bicycles to the back of the gym.


A SECRETARY'S DEPARTURE
LEAD: Like his tenure, John F. Lehman Jr.'s departure from the Navy is somewhat bumpy.
The announcement last week that the Secretary would leave this spring was made by a Defense Department spokesman; there was no letter of resignation, no word of Mr.
Lehman's plans and no mention of a successor - though it was said that Secretary of Defense Caspar W.


MUTUAL RESPECT AND COEXISTENCE

AT A MANHATTAN LOFT, ART AND LAW COEXIST IN PEACE AND PROFIT
LEAD: AT a lower-Manhattan law office, where attention is usually focused on depositions, three young artists have been busily installing watercolors, acrylics and sculpture - one so large it had to be hoisted through a third-floor window - for an exhibition called ''Summertime'' that begins Friday.


ON MY MIND
LEAD: This is one of the pleasantest of cities, full of grace and the taste of history, capital of a country splendid in mountain and sea, and center of a society that captured the attention of all the Americas when it turned from military dictatorship to political freedom eight years ago.

THE WHITEMAN CONCERT OF 1924 LIVES ON
LEAD: Paul Whiteman's ''Experiment in Modern Music'' at Aeolian Hall in February 1924 has been remembered until now only because it introduced George Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' which Whiteman had commissioned for the occasion.
Most of the rest of the program was an attempt by Whiteman to demonstrate the ways in which he was making ''discordant jazz'' palatable.

PROTECTIONISM
LEAD: To the Editor:


BASKETBALL SLUGFEST
LEAD: BASKETBALL may not have the same brawling tradition as professional hockey, but a Continental Basketball Association game between the Charleston Gunners of West Virginia and the Cincinnati Slammers at the Charleston Civic Center Friday night had all the makings of a National Hockey League free-for-all.


WEIGHING VALUES
LEAD: 'The routine promotion of condoms through network advertising has been stopped by networks who are so hypocritically priggish that they refuse to describe disease control as they promote disease transmission.
While portraying thousands of sexual encounters each year in programming . . . television is unwilling to give the life-saving information about safe sex and condoms.


No Headline

LEAD: ''RENTAL housing is like a dinosaur,'' said Chester P. Soling, a landlord who has converted 3,000 apartments to cooperatives.


BRUSSELS PUPPETS PLAY THE CLASSICS
LEAD: Stiff and wooden acting is sometimes a form of art.
In Belgium, the seemingly rigid Toone Marionettes are the smallest, oldest and most dashing of all the inhabitants of Brussels.

Shultz's Way
LEAD: I read with increasing distress Ronald Steel's attack on Secretary of State George Pratt Shultz (''Shultz's Way,'' Jan. 11).
It is one thing to differ with a man's policies; it seems quite another to question his integrity because he differs from you on political issues.

LEAD: As cross-country skiers step onto their skinny skis in woodlands, meadows and national parks this winter, a major topic of conversation is skating.

Some recreational ski tourers are switching to skating from the slower, traditional stride.


IN FIRST MAJOR EXHIBITION, ANOTHER GIFFORD COMES TO LIGHT
LEAD: THERE used to be only two 19th-century Giffords to consider - the well-known Sanford Robinson (1823 to 1880) and the comparatively obscure Robert Swain (1840 to 1905).
Now there are three, because the work of Charles Henry Gifford (1839 to 1904), uncovered by the historian John I. H. Baur, is having its first major exposure in the show that has just arrived at the Katonah Gallery from the New Bedford Whaling Museum in Massachusetts.


WEALTH OF RICHES UNDER OUR FEET
LEAD: HAVING safely passed the scrimp-and-save stage of my life, I have earned the right to be extravagant.

New York: Harper &amp; Row. $16.95.


NEW INSTALLMENTS IN MAHLER CYCLES ISSUED
LEAD: Mahler continues to ride serenely along at the crest of his mainstream popularity (at least one trusts it's the crest; with all due respect to his music, it's daunting to imagine it even more popular than it is today).
Even with the record companies devoting so much of their energies to compact-disk reissues, new Mahler symphony recordings continue to pour forth, unstoppably.

DO LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS HELP OR HINDER?

There is a former assemblyman, two staff members of two assemblymen, the former staff member of a congressman, the sister of a New York City councilwoman and the chairwoman of the local planning board.


OBLIGING THE NOBLESSE
LEAD: The female figure in the Italian Renaissance was not only idealized as a Neoplatonic manifestation of ''heaven on earth,'' but seen as the embodiment of intellectual refinement.
And with this elevation of the flesh came a new cultural phenomenon - that of the ''honest courtesan.'' These highbrow mistresses, companions to princes, painters, ambassadors and merchants, writes Lynne Lawner in LIVES OF THE COURTESANS: Portraits of the Renaissance (Rizzoli, $35), were at once financially autonomous and perpetually enslaved.

ISN'T IT TIME THAT SOCIETY DID SOME HEAVY THINKING?

After Almost 200 Years, Sally Hemmings Still Dogs Jefferson
LEAD: To the Editor:  In his Feb. 7 letter, Judge Bruce McM.
Wright cites as historical fact the story of Thomas Jefferson's slave mistress, Sally Hemmings.

Its origin is almost as old as our Republic.


HAVE THE METS AND YANKS CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
LEAD: The Mets have definitely changed for the better, at least physically, with the addition of Kevin McReynolds and a full year of Dave Magadan.

LEAD: DURING the 1960's and early 70's when copper was in short supply and costs had risen considerably, thousands of homes were built with aluminum wiring instead of the traditional copper wiring.

JORDAN HUMBLES KNICKS

It has almost become a pastime for several players, those who are hoping to be playing for another team before pro basketball's trade deadline arrives at midnight tonight.

'AMERKIA' - SLOGGING THROUGH A MUDDLE
LEAD: The 14 1/2-hour production of ''Amerika,'' beginning a weeklong run tonight at 9, has been a costly exercise for the ABC Network division of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.

BOXER SHORTS AT THE BEACH
LEAD: THE feistiest new fashion in underwear-as-outerwear is the boxer short.
Even women don them for dancing and beach cover-ups, or layer them to peek out over trousers.


LIBRARY CONTROVERSY
LEAD: I am very concerned about several aspects of the controversy between the Westchester Library System and the White Plains Public Library  [ ''No Accord Yet in Dispute on Libraries,'' Jan. 25 ] .
First, the stories as presented to certain newspapers have been at best slanted and misleading, and, secondly, I have had people tell me that signs had been posted in the White Plains Library about curtailing services to nonresidents, when I had received no communication about this from the White Plains


FEUDING OVER CONSISTENT TREATMENT FOR CRIMINALS
LEAD: Two years ago, after tortuous negotiations, Congress and the Reagan Administration reached agreement on a plan to reduce the wide disparity in criminal sentences imposed by Federal judges.
A law was enacted creating the United States Sentencing Commission, which was to abolish the Federal parole system, standardize punishments and thereby remove much of the broad discretion that Federal judges had usually exercised in dealing with criminals.

LEAD: Dean Kartsonas scored 26 points to lead Cornell to an 86-74 victory over Yale tonight to remain atop the Ivy League.

Of Time And Place
LEAD: OF THE REVIVAL STYLES THAT burgeoned during the 19th century, Gothic Revival is perhaps best remembered in this country for the so-called Carpenter Gothic, or gingerbread, houses built in the mid-19th century.

10% INSPIRATION AND 90% MARKETING
LEAD: AS the inventors told it, the biggest problem isn't coming up with ideas, or even executing them, but getting creations to market. ''I have more than 200 ideas, I just need the right contacts,'' said Abbas Husain, a New Jersey doctor who received a patent this year for a ''safer nail clipper.'' By the end of the conference, more than a dozen of the inventors were convinced they had found a contact on the speaker's platform, or at least someone who could help them make a connection.

Transported to America
LEAD: To the Editor:


How to Make Welfare Pay
LEAD: Work can be oversold as a fix for welfare and a cure for poverty.
Just ask the three million Americans who work full time and still can't escape poverty.
Nevertheless, self-sufficiency through work properly remains the fulcrum of welfare reform.
The challenge is to be realistic about just how much can be achieved through work, both for society and for individual welfare recipients.


RAUSCHENBERG AND JOHNS: MR. OUTSIDE AND MR. INSIDE
LEAD: It is by a conspicuous coincidence that a show devoted to Jasper Johns's paintings of ''The Seasons'' should be on view through March 7 at the Leo Castelli Gallery, 420 West Broadway, while simultaneously there can be seen in the new Lila Acheson Wallace wing at the Metropolitan Museum what may well be the single largest work of contemporary art ever to be mounted in a great American museum.


TAKING A STAND FOR DIXIE'S 1988 VOTE
LEAD: ALTHOUGH it is still not certain whether a Southerner will be running for President, there is little doubt that the South looms large in the politics of 1988.

ITALIAN WITH AN OPERATIC SETTING
LEAD: IF you were naming a restaurant, you might have qualms about calling it Rigoletto's, after the ill-starred and vindictive jester of the tragic Verdi opera.

Letters should include the writer's name, address and telephone number.
We regret that because of the large volume of mail received, we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters.


ON LANGUAGE
LEAD: A MALAPROPISM IS a word or phrase that is amusingly off the mark.
For example, a recent pamphlet circulated by the Department of Health and Human Services dealt with ''inpatients'' but stated that ''hospital insurance covers impatient hospital care.'' (Inpatient is a retronym based on outpatient; used to be, a person receiving treatment in a hospital was merely a patient, and only the hatchet-faced head nurse was impatient.) The eponymous -ism was formed from ''Mrs.

FROM LEAD TO STEEL, SWITCHING THE SHOT
LEAD: EVEN if you do most of your waterfowling in an area in which steel shot will not become mandatory for another few years, you shouldn't dawdle in facing up to the challenge posed by the Fish and Wildlife Service's announcement last year that such shot will become mandatory for duck and goose hunting throughout the nation by the 1991-1992 hunting season.


HOW READERS READ
LEAD: NATIONAL security and newspapers, often portrayed as at odds, may both benefit from technology developed by a Massachusetts company and being marketed with the help of the Princeton-based Gallup Organization.

The bridegroom is a son of Mr. and Mrs.
William Healy Sullivan of Cuernavaca, Mexico.


Archetypes And Ex-Lovers
LEAD: The truth is quite simple: Robert Ragaini is propagating the worst type of sexism in an effort to justify his own neurotic behavior.
Fear of intimacy has not been shown to be genetically linked to the Y chromosome, as far as I know.
Continuing the myth that women are naturally more emotional and that men are, as he puts it, ''more goal oriented'' is no different from saying that black people naturally have rhythm.


4 Beirut Captives Said to Face 'Civilized' Fate
LEAD: When a militant Moslem group today withdrew its offer to exchange three American professors and an Indian scholar for 400 Arab prisoners held by Israel, it did not fix a new date for killing its captives.

LEAD: THE New York Philharmonic, so often lambasted for conservative programming, has a powerful if austere bill for its current subscription program, the fourth and last concert of which will be Tuesday night at Avery Fisher Hall.


We Join the Great Line of Ages of Transition
LEAD: To the Editor:  I concur in Michael Harrington's confutation of the stereotype that people on welfare are simply lazy (''Jobs, Not Welfare,'' Op-Ed, Feb. 5).
Yet I cannot but question his implicit argument that employers are simply lazy in failing to ''provide decent jobs for all.''


CONTRAS LOSING BATTLE FOR NEW AID
LEAD: The contras seemed to be losing the battle in Washington last week.

CAN POLITICAL REPORTING BE OBJECTIVE?
LEAD: THERE are many people who, from time to time, blame a biased and partisan press for unwanted election results.
And for a few high-intensity races, that is conceivably true.


HATS OFF TO HATS IN EVERY SHAPE FOR EVERY TASTE
LEAD: BESIDES keeping heads warm, hats are providing a note of needed cheer these dreary winter days.
On second thought, perhaps cheer doesn't quite cover the gamut of what hats are now providing, so let's add some words, like drama, adventure, flair and hoot - as in, ''That hat's a hoot.''


IN RE PEOPLE V. PACS
LEAD: Common Cause, the 260,000-member ''people's lobby,'' believes the current Congress may at last be receptive to some meaningful change in the campaign finance laws and procedures to curb the enormous growth, and presumed influence on policy, of political action committees.
Under the aegis of an ad hoc group called People v.

ISRAEL'S PIONEERS RETURN ON FILM
LEAD: Hizma, Israeli-occupied West Bank Just outside this tiny Arab hamlet in the Judean hills, a hand-painted sign reading ''Dreamers Commune'' points the way to the newest Israeli settlement in occupied territory.
Perched on a hardscrabble hillside 10 miles north of Jerusalem, this stockade-like settlement, with a watchtower at its center, looks to be more out of the Wild West than the West Bank.

Corrections

ELDERLY IN MORRIS ASSURED OF AID

Highway A1A
LEAD: To the Editor: Mr.
Leifermann certainly did his share to perpetuate the Blowing Rocks State Nature Preserve as ''one of the least known'' beaches in Florida.
I read the article while on vacation in Deerfield Beach, Fla., and was intrigued by the idea of visiting this attraction.
I consulted the Pompano Beach office of the American Automobile Association for further information on Blowing Rocks and found that none of the travel advisers who were consulted, some of whom were longtime residents of the area, had heard of the preserve.


Braving Epilepsy's Storm
LEAD: I can't describe what strong emotions Kurt Eichenwald's article ''Braving Epilepsy's Storm'' (Jan. 11) evoked in me.

WITH KEY EXECUTIVES' ARREST, WALL STREET FACES CHALLENGE
LEAD: Four top financial executives stood before a Federal judge last week on insider trading charges.

LEARNING TO MESH MIND WITH MACHINE
LEAD: IN the operation of complex, modern technologies, the weakest link is often the human mind.


ALUMINUM WIRING MAY NEED ALTERNATION FOR SAFETY
LEAD: DURING the 1960's and early 70's when copper was in short supply and costs had risen considerably, thousands of homes were built with aluminum wiring instead of the traditional copper wiring.
Although this was (and in most cases still is) perfectly legal and in conformance with electrical codes at the time, aluminum wiring has led to problems, and in some cases to hazards.


FEW OPTIONS SEEN TO FREE HOSTAGES
LEAD: Administration officials said today that gaining the release of eight American hostages held in Lebanon might be impossible.


A WRITER'S FICTION
LEAD: Joyce Carol Oates has been successsful in a wide range of literary genres, but she has failed to carry off her latest try at something different: a two-word fiction, the pseudonym Rosamond Smith.

How David Salle Mixes High Art and Trash
LEAD: In his article on David Salle, Paul Taylor appears to be confusing a media event with an original artistic interpretation of that event.
The assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald may, indeed, be public property, as Mr.
Salle claims, but Cockrill/Judge Hughes's line drawing of the event is not public property.


Dance
LEAD: The Dance Center is offering a provocative-sounding program by six quite different choreographer-performers Sunday night at the Emanu-El Midtown Y. The choreographers are Janis Brenner, Sheila Kaminsky, Jimena Lasansky, Daniel West, Anthony Stafford and Pam Quinn and Michael O'Connor, a two-person choreographic cooperative.


ROSTOPVICH'S CONTEMPORARY ROLE
LEAD: Mstislav Rostropovich's ongoing 60th birthday party is somewhat larger than life, like his cello playing and his image, embodying the genial, sentimental aspect of the Russian bear.
By the end of the New York phase, which began last weekend at Carnegie Hall and will run to March 21, he will have played 15 cello concertos in five programs with three orchestras, conducted four symphonies and the massive War Requiem of his beloved Benjamin Britten and played all six of the Bach cello suites for good measure.

LEAD: TWO weeks after the Giants'


VYING FOR CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC CORPORATION
LEAD: THE arrests last week of three prominent traders on Wall Street renewed concern about the takeover frenzy and the temptations of its huge profits.

LEAD: THE former Yankee catcher Rick Cerone called George Steinbrenner and asked for an invitation to the Yankees' spring camp as an unsigned player.
Instead, Steinbrenner gave him a $250,000 non-guaranteed contract.

The Amerikan Way on TV
LEAD: No American commercial television production has ever come remotely close to the sustained quality of British miniseries like ''Brideshead Revisited,'' ''I, Claudius'' or ''Ascent of Man.'' What networks do give us is elephants like ''Amerika.'' This 14 1/2-hour political melodrama, costing at least $40 million, begins tonight and tells a good deal about how ABC Entertainment regards the average viewer's intelligence.

Highway A1A
LEAD: To the Editor: My father started coming to Florida around 1904.
I myself have known the area around Melbourne intimately since 1925.
Therefore, I was very interested in Henry Leifermann's article ''Florida's Grand Old Highway'' (Travel, Dec. 14).
However, it is inaccurate to say of A1A: ''It was called Dixie Highway then .

LITERATURE LOST IN THE THICKETS
LEAD: UNTIL Henry David Thoreau in the middle of the 19th century, America had no great literature of place and scarcely even the beginnings of such a tradition.
Here is an extraordinary cultural phenomenon once we begin to think about it, since it tells us that Americans after 200 years had not yet learned to make significant artistic use of the magnificent lands they called their own.


STUDENTS PRESENT HISTORY PAPERS
LEAD: WHEN scholars get together to discuss their research, it is usually at the college or graduate-school level.
But last Wednesday 175 seniors from six high schools in the county participated in a daylong European History Colloquium at the New Rochelle High School.

IN TERRORIST DEALS, IT'S EVERY COUNTRY FOR ITSELF

A Time for Watches
LEAD: THE SOUND IS ALWAYS with me - an insistent, rhythmic series of short happy chirps.
Like a loyal, friendly cricket, it follows me wherever I go.
I hear it at the opera when I rest my head in my hand.
It perches beside my bed, singing as I go to sleep, as I wake up.
It is my link to the world, my conscience, a reaffirmation of order and integrity in the face of hideous gaping chaos.

'KVETCH' ASKS 'WHY COMPLAIN?' AND REPLIES 'WHY NOT?'
LEAD: To kvetch, Leo Rosten wrote in his dictionary-cum-cosmology, ''The Joys of Yiddish,'' is, literally, to squeeze (''Don't kvetch the peaches''); in its verb form it can mean to fuss, to fret, to delay or to shrug, though it has entered the American lexicon as the more generic to complain or gripe.

FOCUSING WITH A SINGLE-LENS REFLEX
LEAD: THE current stampede to automatic-focusing cameras among single-lens-reflex users brings into bold relief one of photography's less-than-well-kept secrets: for as long as conventional single-lens-reflex cameras have been built and sold, their owners have found them darned difficult to focus.

LEAD: ON A RECENT Saturday night, quite a few of the regulars of the ''21'' Club saw fit to knot their funeral ties and come over to the midtown restaurant to pay their respects.

LEAD: IF speculation about Governor Cuomo's Presidential prospects has given him increased stature, it has done the same for some other players in state government as well.

COMEDIES WITHOUT LAUGHS MERIT CRIES OF PROTEST
LEAD: As of this writing, about $71 million has been spent nationwide on tickets to see ''The Golden Child,'' starring Eddie Murphy.
If ticket prices are assumed to be $6 in all parts of the country (though they're sometimes lower), and if discounts for various age groups are overlooked, that gives a low estimate of at least 11,833,333 tickets sold.

Braving Epilepsy's Storm
LEAD: The ''storm'' of epilepsy must be endured on many levels: biologically and medically, psychologically and socially.
Hiding epilepsy, which even one of Mr.
Eichenwald's physicians erroneously advocated, is the outcome of societal stigma.
It is perpetuated by a society that is frightened by the loss of control and powerlessness that the disorder represents.


Highway A1A
LEAD: To the Editor: We at the Nature Conservancy are grateful that Mr.
Leifermann found the Blowing Rocks Preserve special enough to mention, but several statements about the preserve were misleading.

The main reason, it says, is to lobby more effectively on trade issues.


MUSIC: WUORINEN PIECE BY THE SAN FRANCISCO
LEAD: ANYONE wondering why a major orchestra would travel 3,000 miles to give New York yet another performance of Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite or the Brahms First Symphony might have found the answer in the other piece on this program Friday night.
The orchestra was the San Francisco Symphony, that third work was Charles Wuorinen's ''Golden Dance,'' and what seemed to be transpiring at Carnegie Hall was one of those cat-and-mouse games symphony managements like to play with their listeners.

PAUL SCHRADER PLUMBS GRASSROOTS ROCK
LEAD: Early in Paul Schrader's new film, ''Light of Day,'' the director jumps from a sequence of a rock-and-roll band performing in a Cleveland bar to short shots of the musicians at their day jobs.

ALUMINUM WIRING MAY NEED ALTERNATION FOR SAFETY
LEAD: DURING the 1960's and early 70's when copper was in short supply and costs had risen considerably, thousands of homes were built with aluminum wiring instead of the traditional copper wiring.
Although this was (and in most cases still is) perfectly legal and in conformance with electrical codes at the time, aluminum wiring has led to problems, and in some cases to hazards.


LAW OF CRICKET
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


AIDS Victim Married at St. Patrick's

Laker Dream
LEAD: WHEN he was a student at the University of Minnesota, Mychal Thompson dreamed of playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, a franchise that originated in Minnesota.
The Lakers would probably have been willing to give the 6-foot-10-inch center-forward a try, too, but there was just one problem: Thompson and the Lakers were too good for each other.


MUSIC: AURORA QUARTET
LEAD: FOR reasons that are not entirely clear, California is home to a disproportionate number of young, excellent string quartets.
On Wednesday night at Weill Recital Hall, the violinists Sharon Grebanier and Amy Lozano, the violist Basil Vendryes and the cellist Margaret Tait collectively proved that the Aurora String Quartet must be counted among the


Kew Gardens
LEAD: To the Editor:  Your article on Kew Gardens  [ ''Foundation Dug for Long-Delayed Queens Project,'' Jan. 18 ]  implies that ''community leaders have taken a pragmatic view'' and are only concerned with the multiplex-cinema threat to the community.
In fact, the community is prepared to fight the project in its entirety if it cannot accommodate Kew


Some Developers Are Shifting From Condos to Rental Units
LEAD: EARLY last year, less than a month before the sales office was to open for business at Grand Pavilion, a 480-unit condominium under construction on Broadway and West 56th Street, Jack Resnick &amp; Sons, the developers, did an about-face.


Dario Then and Now
LEAD: To the Editor:


CHRISTIE'S 'LOVE FROM A STRANGER'
LEAD: DAME AGATHA CHRISTIE is, by any standard, queen of the mystery.
During her productive career she turned out a prodigious amount of work, including novels, plays and short stories.
In fact, ''The Mousetrap'' is the longest-running play in the history of theater, and it is still going strong in London's West

JAZZ: A SEXTET OF LEADERS
LEAD: THE six jazz musicians who make up the group called the Leaders -because, in theory, they normally lead groups of their own - have not entirely separated themselves from the privileges of leadership in their performances at Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, between Grove and Bleeker Streets, where they are appearing through today.


12 ARE CHARGED IN HOWARD BEACH RACIAL ATTACK
LEAD: It was the second attempt, and it took the intervention of Governor Cuomo to bring it about, but last week a dozen white teen-agers were indicted in the attack on three black men in Howard Beach that shocked the nation and heightened racial tensions in New York.

WHEN QUENNS MULTIPLY
LEAD: Positions that feature multiple queens must be handled in slam-bang style, since so much firepower makes slow maneuvering impossible.
What counts is whose move it is, who gets to fire the first shot, who has the attack.


ASIAN CRIME VICTIMS ENDING SILENCE
LEAD: Vietnamese immigrants who have settled in Philadelphia over the last decade have often been silent victims of assault, robbery and extortion by a small gang of Vietnamese youths.
But that silence appears to be ending, say the police, who attribute several recent arrests to the cooperation of Vietnamese crime victims.


IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD: TREASON IN TUDOR ENGLAND: Politics and Paranoia.
By Lacey Baldwin Smith. (Princeton University, $25.) Lacey Baldwin Smith goes further than the title of his book and argues that ''Tudor England imagined political life to be so exposed to naked villainy and so devoid of friendship and loyalty that only a James Bond could have hoped to have survived.


Landmarks
LEAD: To the Editor: The article about American landmarks (Travel, Jan. 18) mentioned the St.
Louis railroad station and its conversion into hotels, shops and restaurants.
That is an excellent conversion.
I remember the station in the 1940's when it was active and contained a very large U.S.O. center for servicemen and women.

LEAD: AS a child, Representative Joseph J. DioGuardi said, he loved to fish in Long Island Sound with his uncles, but he fears his children may never get to cherish such memories.


Pop Music
LEAD: One of the most startling musical events of 1950 was the emergence of a 22-year-old Quechua Indian from the Peruvian Andes with a five-octave voice who sang contralto, mezzo soprano, soprano and coloratura, using growls, chirps and a variety of wordless effects when words would not suffice.
Her first album, ''Voice of Xtabay,'' hit the top of the pop best-seller list at the end of 1950.

LEAD: The pressures of population growth and economic expansion are starting to exceed the ability of the earth's natural systems to sustain such activity, a new report by the Worldwatch Institute warned today.

120 JOBS MAY REST ON EFFECT ON FISH
LEAD: The Little Androscoggin, a slip of a river that winds through Mechanic Falls in the hills outside Auburn, has become the focus of a fight between state environmentalists hoping to protect the river's brook trout and town residents hoping to see an idle paper mill reopen.


OTTAWA'S BACKYARD WILDERNESS
LEAD: Imagine 88,000 acres of rolling hills, forests and lakes set aside as a natural habitat for white-tailed deer, beaver, the odd wolf and other wildlife.
Imagine it covered by a northern winter's accumulation of snow and frosted with a night's deposit of fluffy new powder.
Then imagine it overlaid with 125 miles of groomed cross-country ski trails - all on the doorstep of Canada's capital.


AN OLD FEAR, A GOOD LAUGH
LEAD: ONE second I was standing square on my feet, shoveling a light covering of snow.
The next I was sprawled on my behind, sliding down the driveway.
I did what a lot of other people have done in the last few weeks.
I fell down.


Bishops Denounce Condoms
LEAD: More than 150 Roman Catholic bishops meeting here have concluded that abstinence and marital fidelity are better weapons to fight AIDS than are condoms, which they believe create a false sense of security, a bishop said Friday.

Thatcher Son Marries Texan
LEAD: Mark Thatcher, the son of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, married a Texas millionaire's daughter today in a private Valentine's Day wedding.
The 33-year-old bridegroom is a Dallas auto executive.

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD: COME AS YOU ARE: The Peace Corps Story.
By Coates Redmon. (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $22.95.) Anyone who has known Peace Corps volunteers in the field cannot help but be impressed by their dedication and diligence.
But readers curious about the first generation of Americans to take on third world deprivation hand-to-hand won't find much of an account in ''Come as You Are.


TALKING: Small Outlets; Setting Up Shop at A Mall
LEAD: AN artist or craftsman working alone often cannot afford the kind of retail space that will best expose his work to the buying public.
With the cost of leasing even a small store on a main shopping thoroughfare prohibitive, his only outlets have been craft fairs, outdoor markets or perhaps - at the expense of a share of the profits - a consignment arrangement with a local art dealer or craft shop.


STATE FISCAL CHIEF CALLS CITY AID LOW
LEAD: The state's Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, called this weekend for increased state aid for New York City, which, he said, has not asked for enough.

GOOD NOVELISTS, BAD CITIZENS
LEAD: Finally there is something to say about Mona Lisa's smile.
A current theory holds that ''La Gioconda'' is a self-portrait - Leonardo without his beard - and that the smile is, in fact, a trickster's derisive glimmer, a transvestite joke: five centuries of pulling the wool over everyone's eyes.


HEARTBREAK IN THE MONKEY PARK
LEAD: ZERO DB And Other Stories.
By Madison Smartt Bell. 179 pp.
New York: Ticknor &amp; Fields. $15.95.


LEARNING TO COPE WITH ILLNESS
LEAD: ANYONE who has ever been ill for even a few weeks is likely to experience some depression, anger and feelings of dependency.

A Virginian Paul Revere
LEAD: To the Editor:


Archetypes And Ex-Lovers
LEAD: As a male, I frankly have grown tired of reading about men who are unable to commit to relationships (''The Truth Is Not Simple,'' by Robert Ragaini, About Men, Jan. 11).
It's old news.


WHEN THE FOCUS TURNS TO FINANCE
LEAD: THE problem with a CD-ROM-stored data base, as I mentioned last week, is that while it is fine for someone delving into history, it will not do for up-to-the-minute information like stock quotations or just-breaking news stories.
For that kind of timely data, one's computer needs access by modem to an on-line data base.


PROTECTIONISM
LEAD: To the Editor:


HIGH-GLOSS JAGGER AND A 'BORIS' TO BE CHERISHED

Ms.
Rothberg, who graduated from Stanford University, is a candidate for an M.B.A.


ROBERT STARER NOW AUTHOR, TOO
LEAD: Many composers have written spirited memoirs - one thinks immediately of Hector Berlioz, Richard Wagner and, in our time, Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson and Otto Luening.
Next month the composer Robert Starer month the composer Robert Starer thors, with the Random House publication of ''Continuo: A Life in Music.


DEALING WITH THE LAWS OF THE LAND
LEAD: I have never been robbed abroad, save for an incident in Ghana in which two soldiers with machine guns took some cash.
That was more like taxation than thievery, however, because the perpetrators were soldiers on duty at a roadblock.
So I never have been properly robbed abroad.
Yet I do worry a bit when I am overseas about the security of my cash and passport.


HAVE THE METS AND YANKS CHANGED FOR THE BETTER?
LEAD: With a pitching staff headed by Rasmussen and Rhoden, the Yankees would appear to have changed for the better.
But wait!
How have they changed?
They lost Ron Guidry, their most versatile, dependable and successful pitcher for the last 10 seasons.
With 15-20 victories gone, the enormous void must be filled by the likes of Hudson, Filson and Tewksbury.

Paul Hardin 3d of Madison, N.J.
The Rev.
Claude Phillip Craig performed the ceremony.


Cable TV
LEAD: What's in a movie title? ''House'' (1986), for instance, conveys nothing, yet it's a perfect fit for the original, entertaining suspense yarn that will be shown on Sunday at 12:45 A.M., Wednesday at midnight and Saturday at 1:40 A.M. on HBO.
This is a brisk thriller about a big Victorian dwelling that inflicts mayhem on its tenants.

Correction
LEAD: Because of editing errors, the recipe for Chiu Chow braised duck in the Jan. 25 Food column is wrong in part.

SUDDENLY, A SOVIET VEIL IS LIFTED, REVEALING SCENES OF BITTER YOUTHS

STAGE: 'THE LITTLE FOXES'
LEAD: Speaking of animals, ''The Little Foxes'' is a sturdy mount that, with some whipping, has made it into the winner's circle in seasons past.
But after almost a half century, it needs more of the whip than is applied at the Equity Library Theater.
Under the restrained direction of Thomas Edward West, it starts a bit slow, shows its stuff around the Act


HOPING TURMOIL WON'T RETURN
LEAD: DAVE JOHNSON says he will warn them.
Frank Cashen says he will lecture them.
Gary Carter says he will watch them.

LEAD: Ib Andersen took over the leading male role in Paul Mejia's ''Sinfonia Mistica'' at the New York City Ballet's performance Saturday afternoon at the New York State Theater.

MUSIC: SHARROCK QUARTET
LEAD: In the 1960's, the guitarist Sonny Sharrock translated the Dionysiac frenzy of free-jazz saxophone to the electric guitar.

The Winter Game
LEAD: Fred Perry, a former junior-college coach who's the baseball director at the new 135-acre Boardwalk and Baseball amusement complex in Orlando, Fla., is determined to make the game a year-round thing.
That might seem an ambitious undertaking in itself, but Perry, who has visions of turning the park's six diamonds into a baseball mecca, attracting college teams 12 months a year, is even more ambitious than that.


CUOMO MISSES MINORITY CAUCUS AFFAIR
LEAD: Governor Cuomo canceled a meeting today with the Rev.

New Lafarge Chief Sees Quicker Pace
LEAD: The corporate restructuring announced last week by the Lafarge Corporation should help cut costs and improve market position, according to Bertrand C. Collomb, the company's new vice chairman and chief executive officer.

ART: JANET FISH STILL LIFE NOT SO STILL
LEAD: WHEN the outside world began to penetrate Janet Fish's still lifes in the late 1970's, it was as a mere bit player.
Her oversized glass objects were still the center of interest.
Plates by the stack, legions of tumblers, bowls and other containers, they reposed on their tables coruscating in bright daylight - no dishwashing problems here, but then no food or drink to cause them, unless it was the fruit and vegetables that materialized about the same time as the inserts of urban and rural landscape.

The ink drawings of Peter Drake (at the Curt Marcus Gallery, 578 Broadway, at Prince Street, through March 4), as well as the work of artists like Sue Coe and Paul Marcus, offer a purer, less self-conscious form of expressionism than any branch of Neo-Expressionist painting.

Diner's Journal
LEAD: THE ornately tiled vaulted ceiling supported by stout columns and ceramic covered walls is reminiscent of a New York subway station before spray paint was invented - which, in fact, it was at the turn of the century.

Egypt-I.M.F. Accord
LEAD: Egypt has agreed to a package of economic reforms with the International Monetary Fund in order to receive $250 million to $300 million, diplomats said today.

Amerika The Dull
LEAD: The main point of the television series ''Amerika'' so far is to reconfirm that propaganda is its own nemesis, by dint of boredom.

But now one wonders why all the controversy.
The film simply falls flat.

LEAD: WHAT does it mean when a pair of 17th-century gilded silver salvers, a French commode, a 19th-century rosewood cabinet, a Regency vase and a Victorian partners' desk are all sold for prices far in excess of the auction houses' estimates?
Have the professionals goofed, is the current buoyancy of the art market responsible, are low presale estimates a ploy to attract potential buyers or was it a bidding war between two collectors?

BROADWAY
LEAD: TWO months ago, Martin Richards, one of the producers of ''Roza,'' said there was no talk of moving it to Broadway and no interest in doing so.

CONCERT: ROSTROPOVICH WITH THE PHILHARMONIC
LEAD: IF music were ever reinstated as an Olympic event, Mstislav Rostropovich might walk away with all the gold medals.

New Italian and downtown Indian.

This disquieting thought came to mind several weeks ago during an exploration on the East Side in which I ''discovered'' Primola, a seven-month-old Italian restaurant that, as it turned out, had already been uncovered long before by legions of amateur restaurant scouts.


Still Upward Upstate
LEAD:  Potsdam (N.Y.) State, the Division III basketball titan, gained its 54th consecutive victory Tuesday night and is closing in on San Francisco's streak of 60 straight (1955-57), the second-longest run in N.C.A.A. history.

LEAD: Pierce Turner, the Old Town Bar, 45 East 18th Street, and Kenny's Castaways, 157 Bleecker Street.
An Irish folk vaudevillian, Pierce Turner writes Celtic-flavored folk-rock songs suffused with affection for his hometown of Wexford.
Recently he recorded a delightful solo album of his tunes, ''It's Only a Long Way Across'' (co-produced by Philip Glass and Kurt Munkacsi), that evocatively mixes his barroom reveries with snappy electronics.


Serving Notice on the Contras

Yet only now is the project starting to move at last, and it will take an additional year before the first occupants arrive at their new transitional home.


Blue Retires
LEAD: Vida Blue retired yesterday, less than a month after signing as a free agent with the Oakland A's.

LEAD: The mountainous waves of a brimming Lake Michigan that pounded this city's lakefront in recent weeks could serve as an apt symbol of Chicago's current political season.


FILM: FREDI M. MURER'S 'ALPINE FIRE'
LEAD: LIKE its title, Fredi M. Murer's ''Alpine Fire'' is ultimately a lot more corny (and a lot less meaningful) than one wants to believe while watching it.
The Swiss film is the first fiction feature to be made by Mr.
Murer, who, until now, has specialized in documentaries, and who clearly knows how to photograph scenery and weather under difficult conditions.


OLD CROTON AQUADUCT FOR WALKERS, NOT WATER
LEAD: The Old Croton Aqueduct no longer carries New York City's water supply from a river in northern Westchester County to a reservoir on 42d Street, 41 miles south.

The Real Threat
LEAD: Many estimable people have protested the ABC television network's political soap opera ''Amerika,'' trying to keep the series off the air.
I think they have missed the point.


WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING Kemp Opens Fire, Sort of
LEAD: A year before the first votes of the 1988 Republican Presidential competition, it is too early for rivals of Vice President Bush to criticize him openly.
That might look like an attack on President Reagan.
But it is always possible to open fire on a secondary target close to Mr.
Bush, on the theory that the Vice


FILM: 'EAT AND RUN'
LEAD: A BALD and very fat man, supposedly an extraterrestrial named Murray, stomps through ''Eat and Run'' devouring every Italian he meets, after which he belches loudly and spits out a button or two. ''Eat and Run'' doesn't get any funnier, and not much of it even measures up to that comic pinnacle.
As co-written and directed by Christopher Hart, this comedy specializes in schoolboy humor at its most mirthlessly stupid.

LEAD: JACK GALVIN, the title character's father in the family drama ''Billy Galvin,'' likes to watch the Muppets on television.
He calls people ''Yardbird,'' and can't stand it when his wife forgets to close the kitchen cabinet door.
These details, in John Gray's simple, big-hearted and essentially familiar film, are meant to say a good deal more about Jack's character than they actually do.


Small Risk, Devastating Consequences of AIDS; Which Researchers?
LEAD: To the Editor:


'My Dear Alex'
LEAD: Richard M. Nixon, who does not issue book endorsements every day, wrote: ''Not since George Orwell, to my knowledge, has there been a broad political satire to match 'My Dear Alex.' This book not only affords reading pleasure; it illuminates and provokes.

A PERSONAL VICTORY
LEAD: Mario Cuomo's announcement that he will not be a Presidential candidate should not have been as surprising as it apparently was to most political buffs.

CUOMO PROPOSING A $1.7 BILLION CUT IN PERSONAL TAXES

THE MOMENTOUS DECISION NOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT
LEAD: When politicians decide not to run for President, it's news.
Whether the reasons they give -especially the family reasons cited by Mario M. Cuomo Thursday, or by Edward M.

A WORD ON THE COSTS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY
LEAD: The article ''Youth Cases Put Strain on Mental Aid''  [ Feb. 1 ]  includes statements by Dr.

WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING
LEAD: It is difficult enough to figure out which departmental deputy assistant associate under secretary one should be speaking with on any given problem, and it is partly because of this that most Federal agencies issue new telephone directories to the public at least once a year.

ABOUT LONG ISLAND
LEAD: EVERYBODY I know who once spent every summer at the same ''summer place'' remembers one summer as the End of an Era.

CITY LAW, 7; MENS' CLUBS, 0

FAST LEARNER
LEAD: If dealing with sudden wealth is one of the things you are supposed to learn in business school, Melanie Richards, a 20-year-old business major in her third year at Baruch College, must have been listening in class.
She bought a Lotto ticket before the Nov. 8 drawing, watched carefully as her numbers were posted on television, hid her $12 million winning ticket in a safe in her Brooklyn home, told no one outside her family, sought legal and financial advice and finally - after coming down with chicken pox and recovering from it - turned in the ticket last week.


A RETURN TO CONTINENTAL CUISINE
LEAD: SAVORIES RESTAURANT in Port Jefferson is a restaurant that is bucking the trends.

LEAD: FOR a man who had just scored 25 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to lead his team to a 128-122 victory over the Denver Nuggets, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of the Los Angeles Lakers got a curious reward Wednesday night.

IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: FLIPPING FOR IT.
By Daniel Asa Rose. (St. Martin's, $14.95.) This first novel feels like a detective story, though it's about the pains of divorce.
The dialogue is matter-of-fact; the action, over a four-week period, moves episodically; the secondary characters are colorful and talk cynically, with dark humor.


CONCERT: LUKAS FOSS IS TASHI'S GUEST SOLOIST
LEAD: CHAMBER music in the modern concert setting is a contradiction in terms.
The irony is especially strong with popular groups such as Tashi, who manage to attract - and who deserve - the kind of large following that showed up at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday night.

LEAD: For a man with an important new job in Minneapolis, Garland Wright is spending an unusual amount of time in Manhattan these days.


Lloyd's of London
LEAD: To the Editor: A Travel Advisory item on Jan. 18 heralded the ''first time in its 300-year history'' that Lloyd's of London ''has opened its doors to the public.''

CABARET: 'MOSTLY MERCER'
LEAD: SOME of the most successful shows presented at Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street, in recent years have been built around the songs of an outstanding songwriter sung by a well-known singer.

ARTISTS IN THE HOUSE

FOR RACIAL HARMONY, HOWARD BEACH MEETS ROCHDALE VILLAGE
LEAD: Ethel Nadel is blunt when talking about Howard Beach, Queens, where she has lived for 21 years: ''A community of 18,000 people cannot be put in the same boat as 12 hooligans spoiling for a fight.''


Snakeskin And Sex
LEAD: One hardly expects The New York Times Magazine to be a hotbed of sexual stereotypes, but the issue of Jan. 25 seems to be tilting in that direction.
In About Men, Warren Sloat perpetuates the myth of passage to manhood through the execution of a wild animal that poses no threat. (Mr. Sloat admits that he could have walked away; the snake was not attacking him or anyone else.) Meanwhile, on the


Mets Given Off-Field Pointers
LEAD: Dwight Gooden was there, sleek and unperturbed by his winter of commotion.
Two dozen of his teammates were there, working out for the first time since the World Series.

AND IN THE RUNNER-UP SPOT
LEAD: Many players have won more than one world team championship, but very few indeed own more than one world pair title.

EUROPE AND JAPAN SHOW NEW DECLINE IN THEIR ECONOMIES

POSTINGS: Bedford Hills Prefabs; 26 Town Houses From Sweden
LEAD: It is not unusual for developers to import special building materials from abroad to lend cachet to a project.
But Lynn and Jad Barghout of Mount Kisco, N.Y., principals of Ramleh Enterprises, decided to import everything.


Classical Music
LEAD: There is no doubt that writing for an orchestra is a risky proposition for a composer.
Because of the tremendous cost of orchestra rehearsal time, and a certain timidity on the part of trustees and subscribers, there is a good chance that a young or unknown composer will never hear a new symphonic work performed.


HOME IS WHERE THE PUBLISHING IS
LEAD: BRIAN AND KATHLEEN SCHWAB looked out the window of their Pomfret home, past their two acres of land, and pointed to the cornfields beyond. ''That's why we work from home,'' said Mr.

The Job Machine Has Not Broken Down
LEAD: THE United States has had enormous success in creating new jobs - nearly 13 million during the current recovery.

And more and more jobs are in services.

But when he looked the other day,


BILINGUAL PROGRAMS ARE UNDER ATTACK
LEAD: THE sixth graders in Hilary Cooper's class are learning to write research papers.
The topic is invertebrates and they can focus on any animal they wish, Ms.
Cooper said.
For the past month, she has been patiently showing them how to take notes, compile a bibliography, and produce an outline.
It is slow going, but worth it, she said.


RECOILING, REREADING, RETELLING
LEAD: UNFLINCHING, according to book reviewers, is what novelists and short-story writers ought to be.

PROSPECTS
LEAD: Tighter Credit Soon


Auto Imports
LEAD: To the Editor:  Harold Poling proposes that Japan limit automobile shipments to the United States to two million units annually, and that it use more American parts in vehicles built in Japan (''Counting Cars From 'Immigrant' Plants,'' Forum, Feb. 1).

Rio de Janeiro
LEAD: To the Editor: Anyone going to Rio de Janeiro who remembers Carmen Miranda, the ''Brazilian Bombshell,'' in those wonderful 1940's movie musicals might want to visit the little-known Carmen Miranda Museum.
We found it in the public park along Flamingo Beach about a 10-minute taxi ride from our hotel on Copacabana


HOW TO GET THE BEST VIDEO TAPE
LEAD: Looking for a good buy in blank video tape is like looking for a bargain in soap.
Pricing depends chiefly on the local store, competing products seem similar, and you can't tell much from the package.
The only guidance usually comes from advertisements.
This is not without value, for some ads can be quite informative.


Cassie Shaw Wed To Kurt N. Holm, A Financial Aide
LEAD: Cathryn A. Shaw, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

WOOD STOVES: HOW TO ENJOY THE HEAT WITHOUT THE HAZARDS
LEAD: WOOD stoves have become popular in rural and suburban homes, not only as an auxiliary means of heating but also as a primary source of heat in some cases.
Unfortunately, this has led to some cases in which a fire hazard has been created because.


THE CHANGING GUARD
LEAD: A big change has come over Washington in the last few weeks.
People are beginning to talk about the Reagan Administration in the past tense.
The reporters are still running around like blind dogs in a meat house, but almost everybody else seems willing to leave the recent White House scandals to the investigators, the historians and the psychological novelists.

Snuffing Out Smoking in the Office
LEAD: FOR the past 15 years, Charles L. Wrye has kept on his desk a sign that says, politely, ''Thank You for Not Smoking.'' An avid antismoker, he long ago decided that even though he has no right to force others to stop smoking, he does have the right to make his own work space smoke-free.


WINTER'S TALE: TOO LONG, TOO COLD
LEAD: THIS is the winter of my discontent, and like failing eyesight, forgetfulness, and cellulite, it is very much a byproduct of middle age.
I used to love winter.
The brisk weather, the beautiful snow, and the opportunity to ski were welcome, but too brief, changes in the cycle of the year.
I don't love winter now.

QUOTATION OF THE DAY
LEAD: ''Students are expressing diminished confidence in their ability to shoulder the responsibilities of adulthood.
More and more I hear students say: It's the administration's responsibility to take care of us.
Ten years ago most students would have laughed at that notion.''  - Edgar F. Beckham, dean of the college at Wesleyan University.


Accommodation In South Africa
LEAD: There are at least two reasons why I read Alan Cowell's beautifully written article ''A Farewell to South Africa'' (Jan. 25) with a special personal interest.
The first is that it reminded me of my own torn feelings in 1962, when the South African Government expelled me and closed down the Time bureau in Johannesburg for what was to be 14 years.

CABARET: MARTI STEVENS
LEAD: THE witty, soignee attitude that one associates with the songs of Cole Porter and Noel Coward were once synonymous with a style of cabaret performance that is vanishing as rapidly as the old cafe society for whom it was designed.
But Marti Stevens, the 1950's supper-club performer who returned to Freddy's Supper Club, 308 East 49th Street, on

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD: WOMEN WRITING ABOUT MEN.
By Jane Miller. (Pantheon, Paper, $8.95.) Women have long written about men as fathers, brothers, lovers, sons, heroes and, as Adrienne Rich said, ''the phantom of the man-who-would-understand'' - the double.
But because female writers have needed, according to Jane Miller, ''to be extremely circumspect'' in these portrayals, many critics have assumed that women write only of themselves.

Snakeskin And Sex
LEAD: It is true, as Warren Sloat pointed out in his article ''Snakeskin'' (About Men, Jan. 25), that young rattlesnakes are more dangerous, but not because they are quicker.
Older snakes develop sphincter control and save some venom for the next bite; young ones give you the whole shot right off - more venom.


In the Running
LEAD: THEY didn't make it to California for the Super Bowl, but a couple of members of the Chicago Bears will be jetting to the West Coast today in quest of a consolation prize of sorts.
Willie Gault and Richard Dent are going to Los Angeles in hopes of picking up a Grammy Award Tuesday night.
They were among the Bears featured in ''The Super Bowl Shuffle,'' which became a rap hit after the Bears won the 1986 Super Bowl and is one of five Grammy finalists for the best song by a rhythm and blues group.

He was 74 years old.


IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: GOING LIVE.
By Muriel Dobbin. (Dutton, $17.95.) To judge by Muriel Dobbin's entertaining new novel, the television news industry is the glamorous career of choice for ambitious women today.
At 37, the veteran television correspondent Martha Vogel is young enough to dream of being her network's national news anchor, but mature enough to realize that her superiors favor female broadcasters with younger, less wrinkled faces.


MUSIC: GOSPEL-JAZZ CHAMBER OPERA
LEAD: ''WHEN THE BERRIES FELL,'' a new two-hour (with one intermission), nine-number score by the jazz- and gospel-based composer and keyboard player Amina Claudine Myers, was described in the program Friday night at the Triplex Theater I as a ''chamber opera'' receiving its ''premiere performance.''

While this is an attractive but not especially unusual program for a debut recital, the circumstances surrounding this particular concert are extraordinary.


GETTING A TASTE OF HARVARD

At the Hasty Pudding Club, one of Harvard's original secret societies, a restaurant called Upstairs at the Pudding is open to the public.

VIETNAM WITHOUT WATERGATE?
LEAD: To the Editor:

LEAD: THE New York Racing Association has been forced to delay and possibly withdraw the promotion, announced Thursday, that would have added a bonus to certain Pick Six payoffs.

LIBRARY ON WHEELS SHOWS CHILDREN THE JOY TO BE DREVIED FROM BOOKS
LEAD: THE sidewalks where Sutter Avenue and Berriman Street cross in the East New York section of Brooklyn are fringed with wastepaper and carpeted with shattered glass.
Unwanted tires and junked appliances are piled high in undeveloped lots, and the gouged windows of abandoned walk-ups gaze emptily from above.


A SLIVER OF THE OLD BAHAMAS
LEAD: North of the Caribbean and east of Florida is a 1,000-square-mile area in the Atlantic dubbed bajamar, or shallow sea, by Spanish explorers nearly 500 years ago.
And almost lost in the midst of bajamar's opaline waters, tucked in among 600 or so outcroppings of land, which comprise the Bahamian archipelago, is an island whose dimensions are so meager that it could easily be overlooked by more adventurous travelers.


IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: OUR FRIEND MANSO.
By Benito Perez Galdos.
Translated by Robert Russell. (Columbia University, $25.) Perez Galdos is one of the treasures of 19th-century Spanish fiction.

Back to the Field
LEAD: THE salary arbitration season ended yesterday with Dick Schofield, the California Angels' shortstop, winning a $475,000 salary.

NEW JERSEY JOURNAL
LEAD: In Woody Allen's newest film, ''Radio Days,'' Ronald Leir, 37, a reporter for The Jersey Journal in Jersey City, appears briefly.

When the Jungle Turns to Wasteland
LEAD: FROM New York's Columbus Avenue to the world's tropical forests, the life and death of trees occupied the attention of many scientists at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science last week in Chicago.
They assessed the effects of acid rain in the Adirondacks, issued dire updates on the spread of deserts in sub-Saharan Africa and discussed the benefits of agroforestry, the practice of growing crops side by side with nitrogen-fixing trees.


PARIS WHEN IT SIZZLES
LEAD: EVERYONE SEEMS INTERESTED in what goes on at the Paris couture these days.
Granted, the interest may not be quite as intense as it was in the 1930's, 40's, 50's, even into the 60's, before European ready-to-wear took over.
In those olden, golden days, the Paris couture was the be-all and end-all of creativity.


Fredericka Gibbons to Marry
LEAD: Dr. and Mrs.
John Martin Gibbons Jr. of Hartford have announced the engagement of their daughter Fredericka Maureen Gibbons to George Hunt Witter, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Orin Witter of West Hartford, Conn.

THE DEBATE DEBATE
LEAD: On one side, dignified but furious, stands the League of Women Voters, ''governess of the nation,'' as the columnist Mary McGrory once called it.

LEAD: RECENT discussions of high technology on Long Island have obscured some crucial facts that will have to be addressed if the local economy is not to suffer serious decline in the future.


WHAT'S NEW IN JEWELRY

LEAD: BRAZIL'S decision to suspend payments on its $108 billion foreign debt last week marked the reappearance of an explosive element that had been kept safely locked away for two decades by the country's military rulers.

FRENCH WITH AN ENGLISH ACCENT
LEAD: THE LARGE OAK refectory table is worn with the rich patina of age, as well it might be after more than 300 years of use.
The fireplace is a gaping maw where whole boars and lambs rotate easily on the spit.
The light filtering through the lead-paned windows and lapping at the tapestry-covered walls is gentle, like the docile, comforting landscape at Clapham House, the beautiful 18th-century East Sussex manor of Sabine and Patrick Brassart.


Deborah Rosenbach to Wed Rabbi R. Z. Schwartz

THE NEW CARNEGIE SOUND PACKS LESS OF A WALLOP
LEAD: I never actually heard Brahms play the piano.
That is a confession that does not come easily to me, simply because I once had a friend, the eminent pianist and teacher Rudolph Ganz, who as a child not only did hear Brahms perform but would sit down and demonstrate with gusto how vigorously the old composer attacked the piano part of his Piano Quintet.

LEAD: To the Editor:  Barry Bluestone and Bennett Harrison greatly overdramatize the significance of the shift toward low-wage jobs over the period 1979 to 1985 (''The Grim Truth About the Job 'Miracle' ,'' Forum, Feb. 1).
They couch their statistical results in terms of the distribution of the net change in jobs by wage level and by part-time/full-time employment, without showing the corresponding changes in the distribution of all jobs.


SHORTAGES OF INSPECTORS HINDER TOWNS

HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT SPRING TRAINING?
LEAD: For me, spring training means that maybe, just maybe, the world will stop talking about the 1986 World Series.
As recently as Feb. 16 The Times rean an article about the Mets' victory in game 6, complete with a photo of the famous ball-between-the-legs play.
Poor me.
Poor Red Sox fans everywhere.


Flaws Seen In Legal Fund
LEAD: The Suffolk County Legislature's proposed legal fund to protect citizens from the harassment and expense of frivolous lawsuits is well intentioned but doomed to failure  [ ''Dispute on Suffolk Legal Fund,'' Jan. 18 ] .

Art
LEAD: There was no reason for Robert Bevan (1865-1925) to be anything more than an amiable but predestined second rater.

LEAD: When Lonette McKee first picked up the script of ''Lady Day at Emerson's Bar &amp; Grill,'' she ''got scared of it.''

LEAD: To the Editor: I read with regret the articles on Turkey (Travel, Jan. 18).

LEAD: To the Editor:  One part of your Jan. 25 article, ''New York's Programs at Work at 'Allerton Coops' '' - the transfer of city-owned land to builders for agreements to produce debt-free units -was of special interest to me because it discussed a matter of concern to me and my community.


ONCE AGAIN INTO THAT ASHEN NIGHT OF HISTORY
LEAD: A NEW generation has come to life since Adolf Eichmann, the dour technocrat of the Nazi death camps, was tried and hanged 25 years ago, his ashes cast downwind from Israel upon the Mediterranean.
Last Monday, the nation began only the second trial of an alleged Nazi war criminal in its history.
This time the defendant was a retired auto worker extradited from Cleveland, John Demjanjuk (pronounced Dem-YAN-yuk), who seemed to startle the national audience in offering a bluff smile and a plea of innocence of ever having been a sadistic functionary in the

LEAD: A soldier at the door waved his rifle menacingly and tried to say that the Palestinians were terrorists.

Television
LEAD: Getting James Baldwin's ''Go Tell It on the Mountain'' to television took a great deal of time and dedication on the part of its producers, Robert Geller and Cal Skaggs, but the effort was worth it as can be seen once again on American Playhouse, Monday at 9 P.M. on channels 13 and 49.
It is a lovely film, rich in detail and emotional reverberations.

LIVING A LIFE ON AN ACRE OF L.I.
LEAD: LIKE so many Northerners, I longed to retire to an island in the sun, hoping, perhaps, that those promised older, golder years would actually come into being with the help of a hot tropical sun.
At any rate, I pursued my goal more assiduously than most, and now I own seaside property in the Bahamas.

SPARE NO EXPENSE, AND ADD THE SAFFRON

He is Son Sen.


JAZZ: ELSON AND HORNS
LEAD: STEVE ELSON and the Borneo Horns, a trio of saxophonists, make their livings in recording studios and funk bands, supplying soul-style riffs and terse, bluesy solos.
But on his own, Mr.
Elson also composes pieces that combine his studio skills - precise articulation and machine-tooled ensemble riffing - with forays into extended harmony, shifty rhythms and wry humor.


EXPLORING THE ART-CRAFTS CONNECTION
LEAD: ''THE INDEBTEDNESS of art to craft is kept a secret,'' says John Perreault, director of visual arts at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center here. ''Artists are always looking for new ways of making things, and the rich traditions in the crafts have inspired many painters and sculptors.''


Tales Of Taxation
LEAD: Things are not bad enough with the Unincorporated Business Tax, as related with wry humor by Andrew Tobias, for hardly has the city extracted its 4 percent on all single proprietors and partnerships, than the State of New York arrives to tax those same individuals on those same amounts that are now resting in the city coffers (''My Troubles With the Taxman.


Turkey
LEAD: To the Editor: My husband and I, having spent a week on the Anatolian coast of Turkey last October, certainly share Mr.
Raphael's enthusiasm for Turkey.
We only regret that more was not said about the coastal resort town of Bodrum and the beauty of the Anatolian landscape.
We rented a car in Izmir in order to go south to Bodrum for a few days, and the drive through the mountains and the broad, cotton-growing valleys was marvellous, going past great herds of black goats and the occasional camel.

Put the Rich Back on the Tax Rolls

LEAD: THROUGHOUT Bowie Kuhn's years as baseball commissioner, Lee MacPhail was one of his staunchest supporters.
They even had a common critic, George Steinbrenner.

Only Rain for the Roses
LEAD: In its season finale last Wednesday night, the girls' basketball team at Carbondale (Pa.) Sacred Heart High School was beaten by Riverside High of Taylor.
The score was 75-32, and play was even more lopsided than that.

AMONG WOMEN, THE TALK IS OF CONDOMS
LEAD: The women who gathered for dinner late last month were all single New Yorkers in their 20's and 30's - a magazine writer, a photographer, a fashion designer and a makeup artist.
One of the participants called it a ''girls' night out'' of Mexican food, margaritas and ''girl talk.'' But the conversation, she added, had never been like this: it was about condoms.

LEAD: ONE recent evening a neighbor arrived in my kitchen after I had finished the advance preparation for cooking a chateaubriand, which was on my work counter uncooked.

THE DELICATE ART OF OPERA SCHEDULING
LEAD: The announcements last week of next year's seasons at the Metropolitan and New York City Operas reflect not only the delicate attempts of each company to balance finite resources against artistic responsibility, but also a renewed cooperation that in another field might raise the eyebrows of a finicky antitrust lawyer.


TRAINER IS RELUCTANT ABOUT DERBY
LEAD: The Flamingo Stakes here Saturday begins the countdown to the Kentucky Derby nine weeks later, which means that the syrupy sentiment surrounding that race will begin to flow: Owners will remember the night the old mare delivered the little foal who has grown into a Derby dream, and trainers will recall that magical morning workout when their colt first flashed the glimmer of brilliance that could win him the coveted roses at Churchill


Class Experiment Injures 17
LEAD: Seventeen junior high school students were injured today when a science experiment went awry, the authorities in this southern Illinois community said.

The Color of Money
LEAD: Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, fresh from an international meeting in Paris on currency exchange, appeared on Capitol Hill Tuesday sporting a vivid emerald green necktie.

CONCERT: ACADEMY OF ANCIENT MUSIC
LEAD: A PERFECTLY unified attack of wind instruments is one of the trickier things to obtain in orchestral playing, and ''authentic'' period wind instruments are supposed to be especially difficult to play, so Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music scored something of a point with their very first sound in Avery Fisher Hall Sunday evening: a beautifully blended, clean, unanimous and well-tuned entry of flute, oboes and bassoon in the opening bar of Schubert's Fifth


UNLIKELY PATH TO TEACHING THAI CUISINE
LEAD: ''BEING Thai, you normally learn how to cook,'' said Chalie Amatyakul, a 44-year-old former hotel manager, travel agent and interpreter with a degree in international studies.

Go, Army!
LEAD: Always eager to bestow some international glitter on his race, Fred Lebow, director of the New York City Marathon, traveled abroad a few weeks back and, at the very least, came up with his fair share of brass.
While taking in the Manila Marathon, Lebow was approached by Gen.
Fidel V. Ramos, the Chief of Staff of the Philippine armed forces.


Teacher Shot Outside School
LEAD: Two men with handguns fired at a teacher today, hitting her with one shot, just after she had brought her 4-year-old daughter to nursery school, the police said.

More Matters Than the Money Markets
LEAD: Key finance ministers met in the opulent chambers of the Louvre last weekend and agreed to the minimum.

Mission to Start Liquidation

TV TAKING A FRANK LOOK AT BETTY FORD'S DRAMA
LEAD: Most television biographies of famous people have turned out to be unabashed glorifications of their subjects. ''The Betty Ford Story,'' which is to be shown Monday on ABC with Gena Rowlands starring as Mrs.
Ford, is something of an exception.
While it is clearly sympathetic to the former First Lady, the main focus of the two-hour television drama is her alcoholism and drug dependency during the years after Gerald Ford lost the Presidential election of 1976.


Change of Emphasis
LEAD: Saying it cannot keep pace with the growing cost of maintaining Division I athletic programs, Utica College in upstate New York will drop all of its National Collegiate Athletic Association programs to Division III in 1988, President Lansing Baker said yesterday.

Economic Scene; Dollar Accord: A Timely Step
LEAD: AS it turned out, after all the delays, the meeting of the Group of Five to Seven in Paris -it turned out to be a Group of Six because Italy walked out - was well timed.

But Crazy Eddie Inc., the home-electronics retailer that had a 61 percent profit jump in the nine months ended Nov. 30, will probably experience its first period of lower earnings as a public company in the fourth quarter, ending this month.

Fair, Respectful -- and Humiliating
