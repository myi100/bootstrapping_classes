LEAD: Once more unto the breach, dear friends, predicting the headlines of the coming year.

To Hoop Fans, It's a Capital Idea
LEAD: Washington-area basketball fans are in imminent danger of a television overdose, and the blame can't be laid to CBS, NBC or even ESPN.

FLINT AUTO PLANT QUIET 50 YEARS AFTER THE SITDOWNS, BUT NEW BATTLES LOOM
LEAD: The big weatherbeaten factories known here as Fisher 1 and Fisher 2 stand silent and empty under the gray skies of a Michigan winter.
Fifty years ago today, though, this was the scene of bravado, determination and tense confrontation as a struggle between capital and labor took place that would change the way industrial


The Year of the Ex-Prisoner
LEAD: What a year 1986 turned out to be for the most powerless of God's children, political prisoners.
Tyrannies toppled, amnesties multiplied and once-powerful dictators were held to account for their crimes against human rights.
There were some deplorable setbacks, especially in South Africa, and progress was uneven.


AT THE MOVIES
LEAD: OLIVER STONE, the writer and director of ''Platoon,'' the critically acclaimed film about the day-to-day life and fears of an infantry platoon during the Vietnam War, was a soldier in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968.
When he assembled his 30-man cast - most of the actors too young to have fought in the war - he had to find a way to help them understand something about the world they were portraying.

Sugar Bowl.


SUBWAYS HOLD RESIDUE OF NEW YEAR'S REVELS
LEAD: It is 4:52 A.M. and someone out there is still blowing a New Year's Eve horn.
The squeal ricochets off the subway walls, bounces down the rails and disappears somewhere in the southbound tunnel of the 42d Street station.


New Essex County Chief Sworn In
LEAD: Nicholas R. Amato, right, with his wife, Barbara, and Governor Kean after being sworn in yesterday in Newark as Essex County Executive.

Amato, a former Democrat, became a Republican and defeated the incumbent, Peter Shapiro, in last November's general election. (NYT/Fred R. Conrad)


Resolutions For Others
LEAD: It seems better to me to make New Year's resolutions for other people.
Then you don't have to feel guilty when they aren't kept.
Here are some possibilities:


LEADERS AREN'T NAMED
LEAD: A six-day session of Vietnam's National Assembly ended in Hanoi on Monday without the naming of new Government leaders.
No explanation was given by the official Vietnamese news organizations for the absence of expected Cabinet changes.


WHY NOT QUESTION THE PRESIDENCY?
LEAD: On the one hand, Americans want to find out what really happened.
On the other, we are told that if we look too hard and push too far we will cripple the Presidency, paralyze our Government, dismay our allies, embolden our adversaries and engage in pointless self-immolation before a bewildered world.


RENEWAL RITUALS CHRISTEN THE NEW YEAR
LEAD: A balloon, still inflated, skipped with the wind down Broadway yesterday, perhaps the last celebrant of the night before.


ART: CHINESE WORKS FROM PRIVATE COLLECTIONS
LEAD: THE China Institute in America is an exhibition space known for ''sleepers.'' In its tiny, scholarly China House Gallery, it has organized solid, low-keyed, informative exhibitions that never make spectacles of themselves and never insist upon broad critical and public attention.
Robert Bergman, the director of the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, captured something of the spirit of the place when he wrote that the ''China House Gallery must be the smallest exhibition space known to man in which shows of true significance are presented.


Medical Goods Look Profitable
LEAD: Numerous companies in the medical supplies industry have good prospects, according to an analysis by the Value Line Investment Survey.


THE FUTURE IS NOW FOR FIESTA COMMITTEE
LEAD: College football fans are interested in Friday night's Fiesta Bowl between Penn State and Miami because it will decide which team will finish No. 1 in the country this season.
The game, however, will serve another purpose as well.
It is an experiment, an opportunity to test the concept of a football playoff to determine a true national champion, rather than one chosen by a panel of sports reporters and coaches in the news-agency polls.


AUCTIONS
LEAD: DID Capt.
John Tittle bring back two large Swedish earthenware trays, awash with images of Roman ruins, from his European voyages in the 1780's - and did he then have Chippendale table bases made for them?
Were tray-top tables all the rage in the late 18th century in Beverly, Mass., where he lived?


LAW ON EMIGRATION IN EFFECT IN SOVIET
LEAD: American officials remain concerned that recent steps by Mikhail S. Gorbachev to liberalize some elements of Soviet society may not touch restrictions on emigration, a major obstacle in relations between the two countries.


Let's Scrap That Indefensible Board of Estimate
LEAD: To the Editor:


Pinola Took Bank Deal Personally
LEAD: The typical language of the corporate takeover - protracted losses, undervalued assets, a depressed stock price - has been applied to the discussion of First Interstate Bancorp's $3.2 billion bid for the BankAmerica Corporation.
But both colleagues and critics of Joseph J. Pinola, First Interstate's 61-year-old chairman, also use such words as ego, affection and revenge.


TECHNOLOGY SEEN AS TOP SECTOR
LEAD: Technology companies are likely to outperform the rest of American manufacturing in 1987, the Government predicted in an annual forecast.
But as in the past, it said that service industries should do much better than manufacturing.


ART: 17 EARLY PAINTINGS BY GERHARD RICHTER
LEAD: THE exhibition of Gerhard Richter's early work at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery (99 Greene Street) reveals only the tip of the iceberg of this West German artist's polymorphous production.
Nonetheless, the 17 paintings on view (through Jan. 17), made between 1964 and 1974, constitute the largest group of Richter's work from this period ever exhibited in New York.


ART: 'THE WINDOW' IN 20TH-CENTURY WORKS
LEAD: ON view at the Neuberger Museum of the State University of New York at Purchase, ''The Window in 20th-Century Art'' sounds like but is not an inventory.
On the other hand, the project may well have started out that way, for it has the feel of an idea that grew and changed shape in the course of its realization.


LOAN COST SHIFT TO STUDENTS IS SOUGHT
LEAD: Education Department officials say President Reagan will propose a major increase in an experimental student loan program in an effort to shift the costs of such loans from the Federal Government to the students.


Diner's Journal
LEAD: THE 11 Cafe is a tidy and welcoming little Venezuelan restaurant in the East Village that offers some lusty national specialties at budget prices.
Its compact dining room and bar with a dozen colorful tables sports a buoyant tropical decor; a tape deck near the coffee machine pours out big band Ricky Ricardo Latin tunes, which prompt an occasional South American customer to break into a few samba passes.


POPE PROCLAIMS A YEAR DEDICATED TO VIRGIN MARY
LEAD: Pope John Paul II today proclaimed a special year dedicated to the Virgin Mary that will be observed by Catholics worldwide.


STUDENTS DEFY BAN IN CHINA:
LEAD: A police officer trying to hold back demonstrating students in Tian An Men Square in Beijing.

Zapata Posts a Loss
LEAD: The Zapata Corporation, an offshore drilling rig operator and commercial fishing concern, said that it had a loss of $159.8 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30 on revenue of $60.9 million.
It cited an ''unprecedented downturn in the energy industry.'' Zapata said its bank lenders had agreed to extend until Feb.


ONE YEAR LATER, A SECOND CHANCE
LEAD: They have seen the future, and the view has not always been pretty.


Gains Are Modest For Nasdaq Index
LEAD: After a bull market of more than four years, it might be expected that the over-the-counter stocks would be frothing, but their moderate gains in 1986 failed to keep pace with those in other markets.


Dudek's Many Roles
LEAD: He practices with the team every day, showing the same slashing style and elusive moves that earned him national attention a year ago.
But on game day, Joe Dudek has to be content with watching 45 other Denver Broncos suit up and play.
Dudek, who scored a collegiate record 74 touchdowns and 474 points in Division III at tiny Plymouth (N.H.) State College, has been on the Broncos' injured reserve list since Aug.


'Dishonor List' of Words Is Published
LEAD: If word-watchers get their way in 1987, we shall not hear of television shows ''filmed before a live audience'' or of ''shower activity'' on a rainy day.


INSIDE
LEAD: Afghan Cease-Fire Plan  Afghanistan's Government announced that starting Jan. 15 it would observe a cease-fire, but guerrilla reaction seemed negative.
Page A10.


Pacers Sign Brooks
LEAD: Michael Brooks, who has been out of the National Basketball Association the last two seasons with a knee injury, returned yesterday when he signed a 10-day contract with the Indiana Pacers.
The former LaSalle forward was San Diego's first-round draft choice in 1980 and played four seasons with the Clippers, averaging 13.7 points and 6.6 rebounds for 293 games.


The Markets in '86
LEAD: The Dow Jones industrial average climbed more than 22 percent in 1986, reaching a record of 1,955.57 on Dec. 2.


Strike Threat Ends At Office Buildings
LEAD: An agreement has been reached between service employees and building owners, averting a strike set for today that threatened to affect the heat, hot water, trash removal and elevator service at more than 1,000 city office buildings, officials said.


BRITISH PARTIES ENGAGED IN A NEW COMPETITION
LEAD: Sometime this year, unless every political pundit here is mistaken, the British Government will call a general election, sending the parties out to do battle armed with their conflicting ideologies, exhortations and promises.
But in recent weeks, Britain's two big parties have been engaged in a competition of a different sort - selling holiday gifts to the party faithful.


New Effort by Wells For Benson &amp; Hedges
LEAD: Wells, Rich, Greene, which has handled the Benson &amp; Hedges account since Philip Morris introduced the cigarette in 1966, has targeted an adult audience for a national campaign scheduled to break this month in magazines and newspapers.


Goodyear Sale To AZP Unit
LEAD: The Suncor Development Company, a unit of AZP Group Inc., said it had bought the assets of Goodyear Farms, Litchfield Park from the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company for $221 million.
Goodyear said the move was part of its restructuring plan.


A Day of Change For a Wunderkind
LEAD: When the top man loses on the first Tuesday of November, the county courthouse has a mighty lonely feel on Dec. 31. ''After tomorrow, who knows what?'' said Joan Doll, the secretary to the outgoing Essex County Executive, Democrat Peter Shapiro.


LAWYERS ASSERT QUEENS VICTIMS WOULD AID U.S.
LEAD: Lawyers for the two surviving victims of the Howard Beach attack said yesterday that their clients would cooperate with Federal authorities if they take over the case.
But the lawyers said they would not be satisfied unless Governor Cuomo appointed a special state prosecutor to handle the case.


DURBAN POLICE QUELL MOB WITH BIRDSHOT
LEAD: The police fired tear gas and birdshot to disperse looters on a black beach, and a black mob attacked a train and killed an Indian youth during a New Year's Day of racial violence on the Indian Ocean coast.


JAZZ: LIGHTSEY AND HIS TRIO
LEAD: KIRK LIGHTSEY, a pianist with a firm, positive approach when he is playing alone, is leading a trio that has the same kind of outgoing confidence, at Zinno, 126 West 13th Street, through tomorrow.


Don't Expand Preventive Detention
LEAD: At its best, representative government tempers the worst impulses of a democracy.
At other times, representatives turn those impulses into laws.
That's what may be happening now in New Jersey, where a proposal to expand the preventive detention of criminal suspects is wending its way through the Legislature.


POP AND JAZZ GUIDE
LEAD: Marti Stevens and Margaret Whiting, Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street (758-2272).
Michael's Pub's ''All Hart'' series of concerts paying tribute to the lyric genius of Lorenz Hart closes this weekend with guest appearances tonight by Marti Stevens and tomorrow by Margaret Whiting.
Each will be joined by the jazz singer Mark Murphy and the series host, Jonathan Schwartz.


2 DIE IN DUBLIN APARTMENT FIRE
LEAD: Two explosions, probably caused by a gas leak, destroyed a five-story apartment building in Dublin today and killed a husband and wife, the police said.


SECOND INAUGUAL BY CUOMO SUMS UP ACCOMPLISHMENTS
LEAD: Fifty-eight days after winning re-election by the largest margin of any governor in New York State history, Mario Matthew Cuomo was inaugurated today for a second term, saying his administration had proved that government could be both compassionate and fiscally responsible.

AN EASY NIGHT FOR THE NETS
LEAD: The Los Angeles Clippers may be heading for the National Basketball Association record books, but it would not be a source of pride.


IT'S STANDING ROOM ONLY AT ROME STATE
LEAD: A HUGE bronze statue of Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, handicrafts and professional flute players, guards the main entrance to Rome's University City.
Both her arms -the left one carrying a shield with its fighting side backward - are stretched up to heaven.
It looks as if Jupiter's learned daughter has almost given up a hopeless struggle against the spectacular overcrowding at Italy's largest institution of higher learning and


SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IDYLL
LEAD: Laguna Beach, about halfway down the coast between Los Angeles and San Diego isn't merely what it is - a gorgeous, overly built, urgently touristed, maddeningly trafficked, adorable beach paradise with perfect weather and old-fashioned crystal-clear air.
It's a symbol, much as Malibu has become a symbol, of certain California styles and archetypes.

WASHINGTON
LEAD: The Administration is at the beginning of a difficult new year, but so far it does not seem to be at the beginning of any serious new policy review.
In fact, you have to think hard to remember an Administration so earnestly pleased with itself in face of the facts.
This year's budget deficit is estimated at $170 billion to $180 billion.


EAST COAST IS RELIEVED AT LIGHT STORM DAMAGE
LEAD: Communities along the Northeast coast began to recover yesterday from a powerful winter storm and rare high tides that flooded residential streets from the Carolinas to Maine and left at least 19 people dead.


The Steady Rise Of Homelessness
LEAD: New York City has continued to send homeless families to New Jersey when its own shelters are full, and last week the new head of the city's Human Resources Administration said he expected the practice to continue at least until the spring, when new city shelters are scheduled to open.
As of last week, about 80 homeless families from New York were in New


WHAT PRICE FAME?
LEAD: In the year 1697 a tall young man named Peter, but not yet the Great, had some trouble in the Netherlands: He was mobbed by curious Dutch citizens who did not respect his wish for anonymity and privacy.
When the Emperor of Russia sailed his boat on the IJssel, other craft would accost him.
In a fury he drove away a mail-boat by throwing empty bottles at the captain's head, an unusual form of naval warfare.

Knight's Impact
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


NEW DIRECTIONS IN GEOGRAPHY
LEAD: GEOGRAPHERS sometimes feel that no one understands them.
People who remember how difficult it was to memorize the states and capitals in grade school and how dull it was to learn of flax production in Poland find it unbelievable that grown men and women make a profession of the field.
In his book ''The Geographer at Work,'' Peter Gould, professor of geography at Pennsylvania State University, writes of the social awkwardness that his calling engenders.


The Disabled
LEAD: To the Editor: ''For the Disabled'' (Q &amp; A, Dec. 7) left out mention of Mobility International USA, a national nonprofit organization, whose purpose is to promote and facilitate international educational exchange and recreational travel experiences for people with disabilities.

Should I buy?


Bowen Plan Showed Concern for Age's Terrors; The 80 Percent Myth
LEAD: To the Editor:  As one Medicare subscriber of many who might reply to ''Fighting Catastrophe for $4.92 a Month'' (editorial, Dec. 5), I view your interpretation of how Part B of Medicare works as simplistic.


GOVERNOR PUSHING STATEWIDE PLANNING
LEAD: THE coming year will see the state government run head-on into one of New Jersey's oldest traditions, ''home rule,'' which holds that local municipalities have the right to control their own destinies.


Buenos Aires
LEAD: To the Editor: I read with great interest the article on Buenos Aires (Travel, Nov. 30) by Shirley Christian, and would like to add a few comments.
You do not need to take a taxi from or to the airport (Ezeiza) and waste $25 or even $50 when there is bus service for roughly $4.
It takes you to any major hotel in downtown Buenos Aires.

LEAD: DON MATTINGLY recently received an envelope in the mail from the Yankees.
It contained a contract for 1987.

Bowen Plan Showed Concern for Age's Terrors
LEAD: To the Editor:  In ''Help Dr.
Bowen Conquer Catastrophe'' (editorial, Dec. 15), you had a few well-deserved cheers for the proposal by Dr.

Melissa Zwanger Weds Evan Oster
LEAD: Melissa Zwanger and Evan Philip Oster, candidates for dual M.B.A. and M.A. degrees at the Wharton School and the Lauder Institute of Management and International Studies of the University of Pennsylvania, were married last night in a penthouse at the New York Hilton.
Rabbi Leonard Stern, assisted by Cantor Nancy Ginsburg, performed the ceremony.


SHOULD FRESHMAN ATHLETES BE ELIGIBLE?
LEAD: The real question is: What is the purpose of college athletics?
If the institution's main thrust is to win, fill the stadium and keep the alumni happy, then let the freshman play and the athlete be damned.
If any educational institution would ask itself how the athlete is benefiting from playing varsity athletics, it would have a very tough time answering in front of the mirror.


DRAMATIC RESCUE IN HOTEL DISASTER
LEAD: He dropped out of the sky like an angel of mercy.
When his job was done, he left that way, and no one knew his name.


What Went Wrong?
LEAD: Leon Wieseltier's analysis of ''What Went Wrong'' is a solid piece of work on the defects in our ideology, but the problem with our Presidency is as much systemic as ideological.
It is a problem that let a superbly qualified President - Lyndon B. Johnson -give us Vietnam.
President Reagan only proves that an unqualified President who is presumably imbued with the proper spirit fares little better.


Third Estate Real Estate
LEAD: As the Democrats prepare to retake control of the Senate after a six-year hiatus, Capitol Hill watchers report that the transition has been marred by unusual squabbling.


CONTROLS ON SWANS PROPOSED
LEAD: THE state's swan population is growing at such a rate that the birds pose a danger to other wildlife, some biologists say.

POSTINGS: 11 on S.I.; Grymes Hill Splendor
LEAD: Generally speaking, real estate on Staten Island does not trigger images of resplendent homes with seven-digit prices.

WESTERN INFLUENCE WORRIES SINGAPORE CHIEF
LEAD: Lee Kuan Yew is the only Prime Minister the people of independent Singapore have ever known.
And so its 2.5 million citizens - an ethnic mix of Chinese, Malay, Indian and European - have grown accustomed to Mr.
Lee's propensity for poking into all corners of their lives.
He is at it again.
With Singapore reaching the living standards of Western Europe, the Prime Minister, who was educated in Britain, is concerned that the country is losing some of its

'THE COMPANY' AS BIG BUSINESS
LEAD: ON 15 flights early last year, the Southern Air Transport Company's big-bellied aircraft took 406 tons of cargo into El Salvador's Ilopango military airport, the principal transshipment point for Nicaraguan insurgents.
Southern Air, a charter airline based in Miami, is a risk carrier, charging premium rates to fly to hot spots that large scheduled airlines will not go near.


TAYLOR PROVIDES A MANY-FACETED SELF-PORTRAIT
LEAD: In a candid self-assessment, Lawrence Taylor has portrayed himself as ''a plain wild dude.'' And he adds, ''I live life wild . . .
I hang with the bums.
I hang with the regular people.'' At the same time, he says, ''I've always felt comfortable with myself.''


What Went Wrong?
LEAD: Congratulations on Leon Wieseltier's essay ''What Went Wrong?'' (Dec. 7).
Mr.

IF IT AIN'T BROKE...
LEAD: MARCH of 1997.

Identified Flying Object
LEAD: ARE YOU BORED WITH your usual wines?
The same old Lafite, Echezeaux and Dom Perignon, week in, week out?
Perhaps it's time for a little flying cigar.


A MARATHON OF SORTS
LEAD: WELL, the holidays are over; their sumptuous color and sparkle are no more than the hassle of taking down lights and sweeping up tinsel; there's nothing to cope with now but the three gray months until spring.
In many ways, it's a relief.


On His Nerves
LEAD: T. Boone Pickens Jr., the Texas oilman, seems to be getting thinner of skin as he gets thicker of wallet.

EXOTIC TEXTILES
LEAD: Over the last 14 years, Pierre Apraxine has acquired his collection of more than a score of exotic textiles - from an ancient Egyptian applique of a baboon-god to a 1910 peacock-patterned sarong from Java.
Now these weavings are being exhibited together for the first time in ''Textiles from the Collection of Pierre Apraxine,'' on view through Jan.

Paying Up-Front For Aerospace Projects
LEAD: THE outlook for the economy in 1987 looks all-too-familiar: another sluggish year with worries about too much debt and too little growth to drive the unemployment rate much below today's 6.9 percent.


Topics: Star Turns; Winners
LEAD: What should a candidate do with leftover campaign funds after the votes are in?
A winner and a loser in last fall's elections offer contrasting answers.


THE EAST BLOC TOLERATES JAZZ BUT MUTES ITS DISSIDENT NOTE
LEAD: Throughout the East Bloc, jazz is no longer decadent or even suspect.
In fact, everywhere, with the exception of Czechoslovakia - where paradoxically jazz has had the longest and most developed traditions - the music has been divorced from politics.


STORM WARNING: ON THE HOME FRONT
LEAD: WITH the season for blizzards just around the corner, it's time to take stock and prepare for the worst.
Last year, after almost 24 hours of dire warnings, all a cautious mother would learn from the television commentators was to lay in a supply of batteries, bottled water and masking tape.
Frankly, that wouldn't get you through the first 15 minutes in a real storm if you had kids.

It will also include Jim Cullum's Jazz Band from San Antonio, two members of a Chicago-based band, the Original Salty Dogs -the cornetist Lew Green and the drummer Wayne Jones - and the first New York appearance of a French group, the Hot Antic Jazz


THE YEAR IN REVIEW: The Region; A Joyful Celebration But Pain and Division, Too
LEAD: EVEN IN ITS DULLEST YEAR - and that is a deceptive adjective indeed when speaking of New York - this city presumes its centrality to the nation and the world.
If it matters to us, the supposition goes, then it must matter to you.
And in 1986, the events from baseball in a Queens stadium to hardball in a Connecticut courtroom justified the municipal ego.


FROM 'NAPOLEON' TO MOZART TO SINCLAIR LEWIS

A Glyndebourne production.
Conducted by Bernard Haitink, 1986.

Late in life it was Bach's contrapuntal style he enjoyed emulating.


A Steady Sales Pace in Manhattan
LEAD: THE overbuilt market of new condominiums in Manhattan could possibly falter in mid-1987, but some of last year's dire predictions of a market collapse will be forgotten if interest rates remain low and sales continue at their smooth, steady pace, according to many market analysts.


The New Fuller Figure
LEAD: So curvaceous women's bodies are in!
The fashion gurus say the American woman's body has filled out from all the ''working out at gyms, jogging and the like.'' What has really happened is that the baby boomers are quietly approaching middle age.
For most of us, that means a bit more broadening - in fact, a delightfully womanly figure!


AIDS DANGER: AFRICA SEEMS OF TWO MINDS
LEAD: One week, health authorities here completed a pioneering comic book designed to warn Central Africans in simple language about the danger of AIDS.


What Went Wrong?
LEAD: Leon Wieseltier's analysis of the relationship between the press and the public was insightful.
However, in mentioning ''that the news media, most of all television, mesmerize the population and its politicians with these melodramas,'' he neglected to mention the complicity of all the players in this dynamic.

LEAD: Dr.
Kristan Charline Dale, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
E.

The Homecoming
LEAD: RESTAURANTS THAT SERVE so-called back-to-basics fare - some call it mom-and-pop food - are proliferating, offering such specialties as chicken pot pie, corned beef and cabbage, pot roast with potato pancakes, braised short ribs of beef and meat loaf with mashed potatoes.


SURVIVAL TACTICS FOR COMPUTER WIDOWS
LEAD: THE microwave beeps, the oven clock buzzes and you shout, you yell, tap out in Morse and signal by semaphore with flaming torches, ''Dinner's ready,'' while your house partner - husband, wife, roommate -types on, oblivious, at the computer keyboard, with eyes riveted to the green monitor screen.

WINTER ELEGY FOR A GARDEN LOST TO MARAUDERS

SUNDAY OBSERVER
LEAD: SUPPOSE PRESIDENT Reagan's plan for patching up things with Iran by swapping guns for hostages had succeeded.


ELECTRONIC GEAR PUTS HELM A TOUCH AWAY
LEAD: Almost no segment of the marine field is as exciting as that of today's electronics.
Microcomputer technology has stepped aboard, and if the products on display at this year's National Boat Show are any indication, technology is here to stay.


The Grade B Script for 'Iran: The Movie'
LEAD: CONGRESS is in recess.
For the most part, that's good news, since the sight of Congress in action makes a lot of people queasy.
Unfortunately, like swallows, or cockroaches, our lawmakers are likely to return.
And when they do, they will apply themselves with fierce determination (but with a studied lack of enthusiasm) to the sticky business of untangling the financial details of the


WOMEN'S ACHIEVEMENTS HONORED
LEAD: A trickle of stamps honoring women has turned into a steady stream befitting their emerging role in society and the history of nations.
Last year, United States issues honored black human rights advocate Sojourner Truth and women's rights activist Belva Ann Lockwood.

New Year's Chill
LEAD: 'We believe that an exchange of television addresses is a good thing.
But why instill in people illusions that everything is in order?
We see no reason for an optimistic tone, which would naturally come about if such an exchange of television messages occurred.'  - Gennadi I. Gerasimov, Soviet spokesman, rejecting President Reagan's offer to exchange broadcast New Year's greetings with Mikhail S.


FOR MENTALLY ILL, LIFE ON STREETS IS NO BOOM
LEAD: THE population of state and county mental hospitals has plunged 79 percent in the three decades since advocates of community care began demanding that patients be released from big institutional ''warehouses.''


IN THE NATION
LEAD: Abba Eban, the erudite former foreign minister of Israel, need look no further than Tel Aviv to see the sad results of an official cover-up of government wrongdoing.
Yet he's taken it upon himself to deplore ''the spectacle'' of the United States ''having little time for anything except relentless self-investigation.

LEAD: The Chicago Bears' season of success and turmoil came to a stunning end today, as the defending National Football League champions were beaten by the Washington Redskins in the divisional round of the playoffs.


WORRIED PARENTS SEEK SAFE ACTIVITIES FOR TEEN-AGERS
LEAD: THE fear of teen-age drug and alcohol abuse is motivating parents to help their youngsters find safer social pursuits.
Activity centers for teen-agers, pledges by parents to supervise at-home parties, greater support by parents for the athletic endeavors of their children and setting aside an area in the home where young people can entertain their friends are some of the avenues being tried around the state.


SIZZLING 'EUBIE!' AT THE CROSSROADS
LEAD: ''EUBIE!'' is just the sort of high-voltage musical jamboree that one can count on the Crossroads Theatre Company to do sizzlingly.
And how the company delivers!
For sheer jubilation, the 1978 musical revue, a collection of songs by the composer-musician-performer Eubie Blake, who died in 1983 at the age of 100, ranks with the memorable Crossroads productions of ''One Mo' Time'' and ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.


WINNING THE MINDS OF SOUTH AFRICA
LEAD: WHEN Phumzile Zulu was a college student in South Africa, she was part of the battle against apartheid.
Now, as a graduate student in New York, she is part of another, related struggle - the one between West and East for the allegiance of the young adults who may be South Africa's future leaders.


SHOULD FRESHMAN ATHLETES BE ELIGIBLE?
LEAD: The eligibility of college freshmen to compete in varsity athletics should be revoked.
The freshmen eligibility rule has been profitable for the colleges and their fans.
However the interests of the student-athlete must take precedence over the interests of the colleges and their fans.
The transition from high school student to college student is traumatic at best, but for the student-athlete the effect of this change is magnified.

Topics: Star Turns; Dim Sun
LEAD: The sun, scientists tell us, is in trouble.
The amount of radiation it sends down to Earth has been decreasing noticeably, about one-tenth of 1 percent over five years.
If this were to continue, all the Earth might freeze.
But, the scientists quickly add, this situation may be only temporary and there is no need to worry about it for a while - a million years or so.

New U.S. Tariffs Stir the Trade Wars

Exlpaining the Allure of the Clones
LEAD: IN continuing my overview of PC clones, to which the last two columns have been devoted, I would like to remind readers that while these computers have all made their mark by virtue of the relatively low price tags they carry, each one has something a little different to offer the buyer.
Therefore, choosing a clone becomes almost as much a matter of preference in, say, keyboards, video display or physical specifications as in the pocketbook.


Steroid Warning

LEAD: NONPROFIT organizations play a sometimes-camouflaged, yet crucial, role in the quality of life in New Jersey.

Some Glasnost Is Better Than None
LEAD: Just as Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan ran for President by running against Washington, so Mikhail Gorbachev seems to seek far-reaching changes by attacking the Soviet bureaucracy.

New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD: THE TRIUMPH OF POLITICS: The Inside Story of the Reagan Revolution, by David A. Stockman. (Avon, $4.95.) The former budget director's inside account of how economic policy is made is a ''devastating portrait of high-comedy incompetence and low deceit in the Reagan White House'' as well as ''a valuable document of the American political condition,'' Michael Kinsley said in The Book Review last year.


TOTAL IMMERSION: HENRY JAMES AND MINERAL WATERS
LEAD: INSPIRED by the current Henry James revival, I decided to reread ''The Ambassadors,'' the masterpiece of his later period.
I'm ready at last for the late James, I thought.

NEW YORKERS, Etc.
LEAD: THERE are those who say that New Year's resolutions serve no purpose, but they are, without equivocation, wrong.
It's very comforting, the last week or two of December, when such things usually take place, to resolve to do good things.
And it matters not one whit if these resolutions are broken, abrogated, kaput, the first day or week of the new year.


Island Park

The project, which is not scheduled for completion until 1992, has already aroused a political typhoon and caused tension between Hong Kong and its vast neighbor to the north.


PRESERVING THE ISLAND'S 'SENSE OF PLACE'
LEAD: It seems that whenever the issue of land preservation - particularly that of the pine barrens - comes up, Jack Kulka, the developer, is there to lambast those foresighted individuals who wish to preserve what little remains of Long Island's natural (and fragile) environment.
In this case, his opposition is to a law that, if enacted, will broaden Suffolk County's power of review over building projects in our pine barrens  [ ''New Dispute on Pine Barrens,'' Dec.

UNHURRIED KARIBA
LEAD: The lion was suddenly there, fixed and big and tawny in the headlights.


MAJORING IN GORGEOUS
LEAD: THE subject was blouses - four of them per student, to be designed, cut in muslin and run up on sewing machines.
By 3 P.M. mannequins had been wheeled in from two other classrooms at the Fashion Institute of Technology, and were lined up around the room.
There were blouses with puffy sleeves, blouses with tucks, imperious high-neck blouses and even the occasional bread-and-butter blouse in which just about anyone would look passable.


OWNING A NEW BOAT CAN BE EASY AS READY, SET, SIGN
LEAD: Financing a boat has never been easier.
At the National Boat Show, 16 lenders have taken space, ready to write loans on new or used boats for as little as $3,000.
Five years ago there were just a handful of lenders, and they wouldn't talk to you unless you were financing a new boat with a loan of more than $25,000.


INVESTIGATORS SEEK TO SOLVE MANY PUZZLES IN HOTEL FIRE
LEAD: Investigators tried today to narrow the search for answers to the many puzzling questions concerning the New Year's Eve fire at the Dupont Plaza Hotel.

Roland Jones performed the Episcopal ceremony at St.
Mark's Church in New Canaan.


HOW ENTREPRENEURS CARVE OUT CAREERS IN UNEXPECTED FIELDS
LEAD: AT the A &amp; T Ironworks in New Rochelle, the president makes the coffee. ''I do what has to be done, even if it's only making coffee,'' said Gelsomina Tassone. ''I guess you could call my management style 'democratic.' Our 21 employees help one another.
We don't have any prima donnas.'' A &amp; T Ironworks, a manufacturer of ornamental wrought iron and structural steel, started out a dozen years ago as a one-man iron shop in a two-car garage on Union Street in New Rochelle.


A Script For Stress
LEAD: To be sure, one of Thor Hanson's ''sins of the past'' that induced a heart attack (i.e., displaying relaxed behavior while struggling against inner stress) is one of the common byproducts of male socialization, and perhaps the most destructive (''An Affair of the Heart,'' About Men, Nov. 16).

Trying to Tame an Exotic Technology
LEAD: When electrical current moves through wire, it encounters an energy-sapping phenomenon called resistance.
The conductor's atoms impede the flow, causing power to dissipate as heat.
But as temperatures near absolute zero many substances become superconductors, offering no resistance.


TEACHING BASIC SKILLS TERMED SCHOOLS' ROLE
LEAD: I read with interest the Dec. 14 Opinion Page article by Susan N. Wilson, wherein she called for mandatory sex education in the schools.
She maintains that by doing so, we will be providing a service that addresses the growing problem of teen-age pregnancies, abortions, AIDS, etc.


PROPERLY CUT MOLDINGS CAN PROVIDE A DECORATIVE TOUCH
LEAD: WOOD moldings have so many uses, both decorative and practical, that few woodworking or carpentry projects can be satisfactorily completed without them.


'GOODBYE MR. CHIPS' IS WELCOME ONCE MORE
LEAD: A good many ''Masterpiece Theater'' fans evidently had something of a struggle getting through the 11 chapters of ''Paradise Postponed,'' not least because of the constant shifts between the present and different periods in the past.
The attempt by John Mortimer, the writer, to break out of what he feels is the rut of chronological naturalism in most television dramas was admirable but too often confusing.


A. P. Crawley Is Engaged To Laura Hicks Tuchman

Her fiance is a son of Mr. and Mrs.

A May wedding is planned.


ROMAN FLEA MARKET
LEAD: Flea markets are flea markets the world over.
There's the usual assortment of junk, kitsch, household goods and used clothing, but the regular vendors at Porta Portese -the ones you find week after week in more or less the same spots - are a show in themselves.
Whenever I accompany people for the first time to Rome's Porta Portese flea market, a milelong sprawl of booths and makeshift tabletops that unfolds and refolds every Sunday morning like a pop-up storybook village, I always advise them to look at the sellers as much as the merchandise.

The New Fuller Figure
LEAD: Are we truly to believe that a 5-foot-10-inch model with 36-23-35 measurements is ''full-figured,'' ''filled out'' (''The New Fuller Figure,'' by Carrie Donovan, Fashion, Dec. 7)?
Now, not only should a woman be tall and skinny, she should also have large breasts.
Only then can she hope to wear ''explicitly feminine fashion'' and feel she has a ''completely womanly shape.


Thailand Closes Big Refugee Camp
LEAD: Khao I Dang, the sprawling refugee city of bamboo and thatch that once sheltered 140,000 Cambodians, was closed last week by the Government of Thailand.

Q and A
LEAD: Mortgage Tax on a Co-op  Question: When my husband and I closed on an equity loan on our co-op apartment, we paid a $600 mortgage tax to the title company, which it said would be disbursed to New York State.

BRUCE H. THIERS
Charleston, S.C.


Adams on Zionism
LEAD: To the Editor:  President John Adams was less a friend of Zionism than your correspondent suggests (letter, Dec. 20).
Adams did, indeed, express the wish that Jews might enjoy national independence.

EXCERPTS FROM THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
LEAD: Following are excerpts from President Reagan's budget message to Congress today:


Signature Gets New Identity

It will become Fodor's Traveler.


AFTER THE ROUT, PARCELLS WARY AGAIN
LEAD: Bill Parcells is not a seer or a mind reader.
He just seems to be a good judge of football talent.


INSIDE
LEAD: Stocks Leap to Record  The Dow Jones industrial average continued to rally, soaring a record 44 points, to 1,971.
That put it within reach of the 2,000 mark.

KISIO SCORES TWO
LEAD: It had been an engrossing evening of hockey.
The North Stars scored twice before the new Rangers, with their fresh appeal - more persistent, more creative, more interesting to watch - charged back with three goals.
The North Stars tied it near the end, and expectations were set for an overtime just as heart-pounding.


Careers; More Need For Liberal Arts Seen
LEAD: AT a time when the world is becoming more technically oriented, there appears to be growing support for a swing back to the liberal arts - an interesting paradox for job seekers.


WRECK VICTIMS
LEAD: Following is a partial list of the passengers and crew members killed in the Amtrak train derailment Sunday, as made public by the Baltimore County police.


Jazz Pianists to Open 'Crossroads' Concerts
LEAD: A performance by the jazz pianists Marian McPartland and Muhal Richard Abrams open the third season of ''Music at the Crossroads: An American Sampler,'' on Jan. 20 at 6 P.M.

Mortgage Note Offering Raised to $302 Million
LEAD: First Boston Mortgage Securities Trust 9 is offering $302 million of floating-rate collateralized mortgage obligations through underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation, acting as sole manager.
Underwriters said that because of strong investor demand the size of the offering had been increased from $235 million.


TEXAS HELD IN CONTEMPT OF COURT OVER PRISONS
LEAD: A Federal district judge found the State of Texas in contempt of court today for failing to carry out reforms and improvements in its prisons that had been ordered by the court.


The Budget: No Plan, Just Poker
LEAD: What is a Federal Budget: (A) a realistic blueprint from the President for spending and taxes; or (B) the beginning of a poker game with Congress over who gets the credit for spending and the blame for taxes?


Officer and a 2d Man Critically Hurt in Fire
LEAD: A 33-year-old police officer was critically injured, suffering burns over 40 percent of his body, while helping to alert residents in a burning five-story building at 222 East 21st Street last night, the police said.

Advertising; Optimistic Outlook For 1987
LEAD: AMONG top agency leaders interviewed yesterday about prospects of the coming year there was a feeling not of desperation after a bad year at home but rather one of mild optimism.


SPENDING: ATTACK AND COUNTERATTACK
LEAD: Are we spending too much on education?
The question was asked in the cover story of Forbes Magazine's year-end issue by Peter Brimelow, a senior editor and a former aide to Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah.
Mr.
Brimlow asked further: ''Why is it that people who complain about $600 toilet seats for the military don't become indignant when someone points out equally flagrant waste in the schools?


EXECUTIVES
LEAD: *
Advanced Semiconductor Materials International N.V., Bilthoven, the Netherlands, said Franc R. J. deWeeger, president of ASM America Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, would leave the company to become chief executive of Krysalis Corp., Albuquerque, N.M., but would continue to serve as a director.


Politics, Egad!, in the Stacks
LEAD: A major post is about to be filled by the Reagan Administration and, according to someone who has spoken to some of the candidates, each has been asked: ''Are you a Republican, what did you do for Republicans in the last election, and how much did you give to the party?''


EXPLAINING THE EXPLANATIONS
LEAD: GAUGING from the number of books sent me for possible review lately, personal computing has probably provided publishing with its greatest boost since the romance novel.
The proliferation of volumes on personal computing began legitimately enough as an extension of the technology, which was supposed to render paper-based text obsolete.

LEAD: Marquardt &amp; Roche of Stamford, Conn., has been named the agency to handle the $2 million Premium Beverages account for Seagram's mixers.

LEAD: CARNEGIE Recital Hall, as it was known until its reopening yesterday, has never been as glamorous as her big sister next door, but in a more modest way has contributed immensely to the musical life of this country.

LEAD: A GENTLE hand has outperformed the traumatic technology commonly used to treat breathing problems of premature babies.

IRISH CHEF, CALIFORNIA-STYLE
LEAD: FOR years, much of the cooking in Ireland's restaurants has been of the ''Gravy, sir?

The current 23 percent tax on all restaurant bills has not exactly helped, nor has the law against serving any liquor except wine; not even Irish whisky or beer is allowed.

LEAD: Postage rates will not rise this year, Postmaster General Preston R. Tisch said today, but he made no guarantees for 1988.


Topics: Budget Trills; In Other Words
LEAD: Government budget time means budget language time.

FILM: 'CITY AND THE DOGS,' FROM VARGAS LLOSA NOVEL
LEAD: SELDOM has any work of Latin American literature traveled successfully to the screen, with the notable exception of Manuel Puig's ''Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' a novel whose author had the movies very much in mind.

'END OF THE LINE,' ON COCAINE ADDICTION
LEAD: ''END OF THE LINE'' is high- speed, glossy and graphic.
It also burns with zeal.

Almost always, however, it retrieves itself.
The program, on Channel 4 at 9 tonight, is an imaginative and sometimes gripping work.

LEAD: Federal prosecutors met yesterday with officials of the city's Department of Transportation to discuss the Parking Violations Bureau scandal and advise the officials on how to prevent similar troubles.


Arbitration for Hurst
LEAD: Bruce Hurst, who beat the Mets twice in the World Series, became the first player to file for salary arbitration.

He won the first and fifth games of the World Series but couldn't hold a 3-0 lead in the seventh game, which the Mets won, 8-5.

BEHIND WALL STREET'S SURGE
LEAD: Most economic forecasters kicked off 1987 with a promise that it would be another year of decidedly unexciting economic growth.
It has turned out to be a promise that the stock market, so far at least, seems to be irreverently ignoring.


Double Drama for Lyubimov Premiere
LEAD: Tonight's American premiere of the Russian director Yuri Lyubimov's adaptation of ''Crime and Punishment'' here was preceded by some political suspense.


HUNGARIAN ENSEMBLE
LEAD: Traditional Hungarian music and dance will be presented by the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble, a group of more than 100 performers, Sunday night at 7 at Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, Goulden Avenue and Bedford Park Boulevard West, the Bronx.

Choice Dates No Help as Hialeah Opens
LEAD: The flamingos were on their infield island, the parrots were in their aviary, the horses were on the track.

AFRICAN STUDENTS IN BEIJING MARCH IN OUTRAGE AT A RACIAL SLUR
LEAD: About 200 chanting African university students, reacting to a racial provocation, marched more than 12 miles across Beijing from their campuses to the capital's embassy district today to protest an apparently fraudulent letter slurring their behavior and manners.

In the Mail
LEAD: Are Americans throwing away, unopened, letters that solicit donations or sell products?
The Armed Forces Journal thinks so.
The Washington publication, circulating a questionnaire to update its mailing list, printed on the envelope: ''Please, please, please open this envelope and reply.
We are not asking for any money, we promise!


Mr. Reagan's Choice
LEAD: The Reagan Administration's ''well-intentioned effort to find an opening to Iran,'' says Senator David Durenberger of Minnesota, ''met up with a scam and got taken to the cleaners.
But . . . it is not a thing by which you topple a Government or tie up Congress for a year.''


RESTAURANTS
LEAD: KITCHO is not a name that is bandied about often when gastronomic commandos huddle to swap intelligence reports on hot spots in the field.
This 20-year-old midtown Japanese restaurant is about as chic as a Honda Civic, notable more for its longevity than its luster.
Its formula for graceful aging is unglamorous and straightforward: a warm and efficient staff combined with dependably fresh and attractive Japanese food.


Guarneri String Quartet
LEAD: The Guarneri String Quartet will play works by Beethoven, Shostakovich and Brahms at the Metropolitan Museum of Art tomorrow night at 8.
The violist Samuel Rhodes and the cellist Joel Krosnick will be the guest artists in a performance of the Sextet No. 2 in G by Brahms.

No U.S.F.L. in '87
LEAD: The United States Football League, which canceled its 1986 season, remains alive, although a lengthy court appeal will keep it dormant again in 1987, according to Commissioner Harry Usher. ''Given the time for appeal, we felt it unlikely there would be a season,'' Usher said yesterday. ''It will take about a six-month time frame to hear the appeal.


A GIANT VICTORY: WINNING THE FANS
LEAD: For years, the New York area had a love affair with the football Giants.
The Giants seemingly could do no wrong, at least not until they moved to the Jersey Meadowlands in 1976.
Then, when their losing ways continued, they seemingly could do no right.
Now, as they are about to play a game that could put them into Super Bowl X


PRESSURE AGAINST FRANC PERSISTS AS MARK SOARS
LEAD: The franc remained under strong downward pressure today, but both France and West Germany continued to resist the idea of realigning their currencies.


FRICK AWAITS NEW DIRECTOR
LEAD: There's a widespread belief that things never change at the Frick Collection.
But they do, albeit slowly.

Mr.
Fahy, who has headed the Frick since 1973, will become chairman of the department of European paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of

THE THEATER: 'SWEET SUE,' WITH MOORE AND REDGRAVE
LEAD: AS an articulate theatrical chronicler of WASP manners and mating habits, A. R. Gurney Jr. specializes in richly populated and furnished interior landscapes.
The playwright is at his most artful when he invents an apparatus as premise - the dining room as an unchangeable environment for multi-generational maneuverings; a ''party critic'' who reviews a social gathering as emblematic of a way of life.


Boom-Booms as Bonbons
LEAD: In the aftermath of World War I, there was a great campaign against the ''merchants of death'' who made fortunes selling arms and encouraging wars to use them up.
Making money is now an important factor for governments in the world arms trade, but the politics of trying to win friends and influence people, not to speak of buying back hostages, has overtaken it.


Wishful Thinking
LEAD: Coach Buddy Ryan, whose Philadelphia Eagles don't select until ninth in the college draft, on why they nonetheless have a shot at quirky Brian Bosworth: ''Really, what I'm hoping is that enough people think there's something wrong with him that he's still there when we pick.''

The decision to have a new theatrical opening, with a large-scale national advertising campaign and new promotional material, is an unusual marketing strategy, since most films are released for video shortly after their first theatrical run.

LEAD: To the Editor:

Portland General
LEAD: The Portland General Electric Company said it had established a reserve to write down its investment in the Washington Public Power Supply System's Nuclear Project No. 3.

Democrats Are Smiling
LEAD: On one of the little-noted battlefields of the 1986 election, party leaders are only now completing the body count.
To the Democrats' satisfaction and mild surprise, they appear to have scored a significant victory in state legislative races, one that bodes well for party prospects of retaining control of the House of


Giving Love, or Selling Life?
LEAD: Who, short of Solomon, would choose to be in Harvey R. Sorkow's shoes these days?
He is the New Jersey judge who must decide the legality of the contract by which Mary Beth Whitehead agreed to bear a child for William and Elizabeth Stern.
Then Judge Sorkow must determine with whom the fruit of that contract, a little girl, should live - the biological mother and her husband, or the biological father (by artificial insemination) and his wife.


AROUND QUEENS BOROUGH HALL, MANES MYSTERY LINGERS
LEAD: What Donald R. Manes did in the seven hours before he was found after his first suicide attempt a year ago is still a mystery.
But for many people in Queens, an even greater mystery continues to be Mr.
Manes himself.


Parade Poll
LEAD: While New York's politicians debate whether there should be a ticker tape parade for the Giants should they win the Super Bowl, the city's public favors one, but just barely.


Diner's Journal
LEAD: BEIGNETS, the deep-fried pastry fritters that are synonymous with the French Quarter of New Orleans, were not what I had in mind when I dropped into Patisserie Lanciani on Prince Street late one evening, still hungry after a woebegone dinner in a tragically chic SoHo restaurant.
This pleasantly minimalist cafe and carryout, with gray walls and scattered


FEHR POSTS 67 FOR LEAD
LEAD: Most good rounds of golf include at least one moment when a player salvages par from bogey country.
But when a player gets birdies more than once from under the trees, he is going into four leaf clover territory.


Corrections
LEAD: A chart yesterday with a poll on race relations in New York City misidentified its sponsors.
Also, in some copies it incorrectly reported results of a question about Mayor Koch's handling of the situation that began with an attack on three black men in Queens last month.
The survey was a New York Times/WCBS-TV Poll; the correct results of the question about Mayor Koch appear today on page B2.

Kidder Unit Offers Mortgage Notes
LEAD: Kidder Peabody Mortgage Assets Trust Three yesterday began offering $500 million of collateralized mortgage obligations divided into five parts, one of which bears a floating interest rate.
Rated triple-A by the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation, the obligations are backed by 9 and 9 1/2 percent Federal Home Loan Mortgage


NEW SHOPS REVITALIZE A WEST SIDE BLOCK
LEAD: Just a few steps away from such Upper West Side stalwarts as the Louis Lichtman bakery and Barney Greengrass, the sturgeon king, is the latest addition to the rapidly gentrifying neighborhood - a blocklong suite of shops at the base of the Packard, a newly built condominium building, and the adjacent refurbished rental building.


OUTDOORS
LEAD: Although the casual angler in the Northeast puts his gear away before October is done, there are some dedicated fishermen who regard winter as simply another season, albeit often uncomfortable, in which to pursue their sport.


The Test for Running the C.I.A.
LEAD: The sad truth about Washington's chief collector of secrets is no longer a secret.
There seems to be no chance that William Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, can recover sufficiently from a cancer operation to resume his duties.
Already the capital buzzes with speculation about who should succeed him.

LEAD: HART AND SOUL: Gary Hart's New Hampshire Odyssey . . . and Beyond.
By Susan Berry Casey. (NHI Press, Box 825, Concord, N.H. 03301. Paper, $9.95.) These are the hard basics of running for President, particularly for an underdog like Senator Gary Hart in 1984: up before a cold New Hampshire dawn in a forlorn motel or a campaign worker's house to climb into a van driven by a campaign volunteer to accost hurrying factory workers at the plant gate or sleepy diners in a greasy spoon.

MUSEUM HOPPING IN ATHENS
LEAD: Along with the Acropolis and a few other sites of antiquity, the museums of Athens are the principal attractions of a city that increasingly disappoints visitors by falling short of its renown.
The museums compensate, by their variety and interest, for a capital that has suffered more than most from rapid urban growth and the effects of air pollution, noise and traffic.


COMFORT IN AGING WITH GRACE
LEAD: The great days are gone - it is no matter; No lines come easy now upon my tongue.
The world has been in crisis all my life What else could I do but hold on as it spun And say my little say and sing my song?
My causes all were won - or they were lost; And now my friends depart and leave me lonely -And yet - to see the blossoms in the springtime To watch the sunset hover on the sea And know that the one I love is by my side Oh lucky was I - lucky I remain.

Peru
LEAD: To the Editor: We enjoyed Nicholas D. Kristof's views and coverage of Peru and Cuzco (Travel, Oct. 5), a country full of history and art.

INDIAN FARE ADDS SOME OF SPICE OF LIFE
LEAD: FOR Christmas this year an enterprising friend gave me a large basket filled with Indian spices in small bags tied with ribbon.

KARLA STUEMPFLE MSALL  Buffalo


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD: MIDAIR, by Frank Conroy. (Penguin, $5.95.) This collection of stories by Frank Conroy is as spare as his autobiographical novel, ''Stop-Time,'' was expansive, William H. Pritchard said in these pages in 1985.
Some of the tales, he said, are ''dreamlike happenings reminiscent of Franz Kafka or Nathanael West, with perhaps a twist of Philip Roth,'' while others are ''admirable precisely for their realistic textures, the way they provide us with confirmation of common experiences.


SOVIET RETURNEES ANGER EMIGRES IN BROOKLYN

Looking for a Dock for the Day Sailor
LEAD: THE industry, now beginning its summer retail season, always paints a rosy picture for consumers at the boat show.

LEAD: To the Editor:
I was startled to read the description of John Updike's most recent novel, ''Roger's Version,'' in the first paragraph of the Rev.
John P. Meier's fine article ''Jesus Among the Historians'' (Dec. 21).
The young student pitted against Roger Lambert is not a divinity student but a computer programmer who has worked on computer research projects at the university where Lambert teaches, as the young man tells Lambert on page 18 of the novel.

THE BIG BUSINESS OF SMALL BUSINESS
LEAD: ON any given day, 2.5 million of the country's businesses are up for sale.
And while much is heard about the large companies that come on the block, 98 percent of the businesses looking for buyers fall into the small- to medium-size category, those with yearly sales of less than $30 million.
Yet, the number of business-brokerage offices equipped to serve this huge market are few; only 3,000 nationwide, compared with 150,000 real-estate brokerage offices - even though business sales account for $300 billion a year, $50 billion more than real-estate sales generate yearly.

Immigrants
LEAD: To the Editor:  I agree with Mr.
Chiswick on the desirability of having an immigration policy that favors applicants for immigration who are most likely to be productive members of American society.

Giants Outrage
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:  In the aftermath of my euphoria over the Giants' most convincing victory of the year, I sat down in my favorite chair to read the Sunday sports section.
I had scanned it before the game looking for any last-minute injury reports, but otherwise was too keyed up about the game to really sit down and read it.


A Poet's Subject
LEAD: To the Editor:
I would like to thank David Kirby, the reviewer of my book of poems, ''Dominion'' (Oct. 12), for his descriptive, nonjudgmental approach to my writing.

But rarely does it attack top officials, let alone suggest that the K.G.B. might abuse its enormous powers.

LEAD: THE Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority has issued bonds for a $42 million waste-to-energy plant to be built in Wallingford.

A LANDMARK OF MISFEASANCE
LEAD: Seven members of the New York City Landmarks Commission last week issued a gratuitous warning against any proposal that would obscure part of the rear of the New York Public Library on 42d Street.

LEAD: N.H.L.
Flyers 5, Bruins 4: A goal by Murray Craven at 13 minutes 5 seconds of the third period snapped a 4-4 tie and gave the Philadelphia Flyers a 5-4 victory over the Bruins yesterday in Boston.
Craven took a pass from Tim Kerr in a scramble in front of the Boston net and whirled round to beat the Bruins' goalie, Bill Ranford.


Richmond
LEAD: For many years the anti-paradisal view that Richmond was a dull, conservative, rundown red-brick industrial town induced many travelers to skip the city.
Things have changed so much, however, that visitors now wish they could spend more time in the Capital of the Confederacy.


N.F.C. CHAMPIONSHIP: GIANTS vs. REDSKINS; Tradition, Pride and Now Glory: Coach

Finding the Unusual in Singapore
LEAD: Where do all those pinstriped Singapore yuppies go at the end of their air-conditioned days at the office?

LETTER FROM CHINA - YOUNG WRITERS TEST THE LIMITS
LEAD: THE Government crackdowns on the recent demonstrations in Shanghai, Beijing and other Chinese cities demanding greater democracy and freedom of expression are a striking example of the constantly shifting climate of intellectual freedom in China.
Even in the more liberal ideological atmosphere of Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms, Chinese find it extremely dificult to gauge the boundaries on freedom of expression.

U.S. ENVOY ON MIDDLE EAST VISIT

THE DEMOCRATS' DILEMMA

RECITAL: SAMUEL RAMEY
LEAD: THE chief distinctions of Samuel Ramey's singing, all discernible in the song recital he gave Friday night in a sold-out Carnegie Hall, arise from a vocal technique appreciably finer than that cultivated by his bass colleagues on the operatic scene.
He sings with sonorous power, but stops short of the force that might jeopardize steadiness and control.


Trying to Preserve An Unusual View
LEAD: Viewed from the west, the New York Public Library provides passers-by with a striking facade.
Twenty-six bands of light marble alternate with dark, vertical windows, distinguishing the 75-year-old building from others in the Beaux-Arts style.

New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $18.95.


A New Era
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:  Regarding the New York Yacht Club's America's Cup campaign, I would like to note that although it is the first time since the inception of the America's Cup in the 19th century that the club has not been involved in the final series, it is also the first time the New York Yacht Club has had to compete to be involved in the final series.


Verbatim; Reforms Needed
LEAD: 'Even if you indict and convict every mobster involved in corruption, under current conditions, someone else will come along, recognize the potential and become the new predators.'


TOPICS: Steps Forward; CURBED ADVANTAGE

LEAD: To the Editor:


Hold the Replays
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:  I would like to put in a vote for the abolition of the National Football League's replay rule.
It was a joy to watch Penn State play Miami in the Fiesta Bowl without having to wait 4 minutes 10 seconds between plays. (a la Rams vs. Redskins).

LEAD: Caroline Hudson Lynch of New York and Palm Beach, Fla., a trustee of the Cathedral of St.

A Fact-Based Drama Gets Bogged Down in Fidelity
LEAD: ''Mercy or Murder?'' is not a satisfying television movie, in part because the real-life killing and trial it dramatizes had no satisfying conclusion.
Did justice triumph?


STATES ARE MAKING RECYCLING A MUST
LEAD: RECYCLING, a fever of the 1970's that cooled when concern over shortages eased and markets for recycled materials were slow to develop, is on the rise again.
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are in various stages of implementing plans to recycle at least 25 percent of their solid waste and incinerate much of the rest to produce energy.


KNICKS PUT IT TOGETHER
LEAD: It is no secret that the Knicks win games when their two most important frontcourt players, Patrick Ewing and Bill Cartwright, play well enough to dominate their respective defenders.
And when the two have failed, it has often been because the Knicks did not have a deep threat whose outside shot kept the opposing defense away from them.


HELPING CHILDREN MEET THE CHALLENGE OF WRITING
LEAD: WHEN I was in elementary school, I always did my homework at the kitchen table.
As I worked, Mom ironed, and when I needed help Mom was there.


A TROVE OF BRIC-A-BRAC IN THE MARAIS
LEAD: There is a little chunk of Paris that has been hollowed out and spruced up, reconstituted into a village and set down beside the Seine.
On a bright weekday morning, it seems surrounded by the flowing of water: by the handsome 17th-century fountains and spouts of this corner of the Marais, where the odd wanderer may be washing a blanket, and by the streams that gush mysteriously from the gutters of


2 GARBAGE ISSUES AWAIT ACTION BY COUNTY IN 1987
LEAD: COUNTY officials responsible for disposing of Westchester's garbage ended last year with a sigh of relief -feeling that they had resolved several potential crises - but acknowledged last week that this year loomed with two major questions unresolved.


The Trend That Didn't Take
LEAD: At the couture shows in Paris last fall and earlier this winter, a few designers unleashed a parade of flamboyant coiffed hairdos to go with their elaborately poufed evening dresses.
The fashion pundits instantly predicted that women would be racing to salons for false hairpieces and layers of teasing - a fad that had faded with the 1960's.


Biaggi Is Said to Face Indictment
LEAD: As a force in Bronx politics for decades and a Democratic Congressman since 1969, 69-year-old Mario Biaggi has been a target of several Federal inquiries; last week prosecutors in Brooklyn were reported to have asked the Justice Department for permission to seek a joint indictment naming Mr.
Biaggi and Meade H.


Putting a Career On Hold
LEAD: Does no writer on the subject of careers versus motherhood have the temerity to tell a probable truth: that many corporate women quit ''to raise my children'' purely and simply because working is just too tough?

J.

Pickens Takes Aim At Shamrock Again
LEAD: T. Boone Pickens closed in on Diamond Shamrock, a property he has been coveting for years.
His investment group, Lucky Partners, offered $15 a share, $300 million, for 18 percent of Shamrock's shares, which would give it 22.5 percent.
And while William H. Bricker, Shamrock's chairman, is not likely to capitulate easily, Mr.


INDIAN FARE ADDS SOME OF SPICE OF LIFE
LEAD: FOR Christmas this year an enterprising friend gave me a large basket filled with Indian spices in small bags tied with ribbon.
Of course, as soon as I smelled it, I craved Indian food.
For the next two weeks, the house was filled with the warm, musky aroma of an Indian bazaar as I set about cooking my favorite dishes and tried some new ones.

V.A. Is Fined For Purging Files In Radiation Case
LEAD: The Veterans Administration must pay an estimated $115,000 in penalties for trying to purge its files of potentially embarrassing documents, a Federal judge in San Francisco ruled last week.
The agency had been ordered to supply the documents to a group representing 5,000 veterans who were exposed to radiation in Japan after World War II and in postwar tests of nuclear bombs.


NOW LAWYERS ARE HOLLYWOOD SUPERSTARS
LEAD: AT the top of the MCA black tower, in the office recently vacated by Frank Price, Thomas Philip Pollock is hunched over a pastrami sandwich and a Diet Coke.
As the new overlord of Universal movies, Mr.
Pollock is at the peak of the Hollywood hierarchy.
But his appointment is more than just another executive move in an industry where people change jobs as often as movie stars change cars.


UNCLOGGING A TOILET: PLUNGERS AND AUGERS
LEAD: ALTHOUGH chemical drain cleaners often work well on clogged sinks, they seldom help a clogged toilet much.


Deborah G. Ewen Wed To W. Ward Whipple

Mr.
Scharfstein is a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Bernard Scharfstein of New


Putting a Career On Hold
LEAD: Barbara Basler's article ''Putting a Career on Hold'' (Dec. 7) causes me grave concern.
The women she describes have ''made it to the top'' and yet choose not to juggle the demands of career, marriage and family, even with the supports that their salaries can provide.
The attention paid to this minority of women serves to distract attention from the majority of women who have always juggled these demands.


Two States Of the States
LEAD: Governors Cuomo and O'Neill moved into new terms last week and greeted new legislators, Governor O'Neill happily addressing the question of how to spend Connecticut's money and Governor Cuomo concentrating on how not to spend New York's.


POSTING: Westhampton Colony;
LEAD: The yearnings of those who want to live by the water - both fresh and saline - may be quenched by a single-family house development planned for Westhampton, L.I.
The 67-acre tract includes a nine-acre lake, and South Shore beaches are only a ''couple of minutes away by bicycle and a lot more minutes by car in summer traffic,'' according to Harvey K.

RAIL AGENCY PICKS UP PIECES AFTER AMTRAK'S WORST CRASH
LEAD: A DECADE ago, the Federal Government embarked on an ambitious $2 billion program to rehabilitate passenger train service between Boston and Washington.

Kosar and Elway Will Fill the Air
LEAD: True to its passing heritage, the American Football Conference features a pair of dominating quarterbacks in Sunday's championship game.


A COLLAGIST'S MOSAIC OF GOD, LITERATURE AND HIS PEOPLE
LEAD: Romare Bearden's intimate tapestries are about memory and forgetting, wisdom and laughter, silence and song.
His human comedy is pieced together with the hard, racy, broken rhythms of New York City, where he has spent most of his life, and the communal rhythms of Mecklenburg County, N.C., where he spent the summers of his youth.


Condos Top Northeast Ski-Area Boom
LEAD: CONDOMINIUMS, which shot up alongside the birch and pine trees of Northeast ski resorts in the 1970's, seemed to push chalets and other single-family homes to the edge of extinction, as well as bruising motels a bit.


Correction
LEAD: Because of a production error, an article in the Westchester Weekly today about Scarsdale's offer of a house to the homeless appears with a section omitted.
A corrected version will be printed next Sunday.


Dining in Paris
LEAD: To the Editor: It may be time to re-evaluate our stereotype of the Ugly American tourist in Europe.
We travel to France often and enjoy the country, its culture and its cuisine.
We find brasseries most enjoyable for good food at almost any hour, but the noise of the conversations is usually at near-shouting level.


MIDWEST BURIED BY SNOW
LEAD: The biggest storm of the winter swept through the Great Lakes area and into the Northeast yesterday, dumping nearly a foot of snow in the Great Plains and the Middle West.
Schools were closed and at least 15 people were killed in traffic accidents on slick roads.

LEAD: Four Iranians, stowaways on a freighter bound for Newark from Istanbul, were pulled from New York Harbor early yesterday morning after they jumped from the ship, the police said.


WHAT RAIL TICKETS REALLY COST
LEAD: Improvements in Metro-North's rail service have been widely acclaimed in recent years in the press, by public officials and even by commuter groups that are usually critical of railroad service.
Typical is the article ''Metro-North Basks in Progress''  [ Nov. 9 ] .
The article discusses how bad conditions on the railroad were only three yeas ago and how good the service is today.


A LEAFY LOS ANGELES HIDEAWAY
LEAD: Winding along Stone Canyon Road, pausing for a better look at baronial estates tucked behind overhanging sycamores and high iron gates, first-time guests at the Hotel Bel-Air might wonder if they have taken a wrong turn.
What would a hotel be doing amid all the wealth and splendor of Bel-Air, the fabled wooded retreat for dozens of


STORES WITH BASICS, PLUS PERSONAL TOUCH
LEAD: THE Charles Department Store in Katonah, established in 1924, bills itself as ''the store that has everything'' - clothes and shoes for the entire family, appliances and cookware, vacuum cleaners and stationery, fabrics and televisions, picture frames and camping gear.
Everything is stacked, hung and layered in an area measuring only 5,000 square feet, presided over by the Raneri brothers - Jim, 31 years old, and


DELAWARE TOWN PLANS RAFFLE
LEAD: The Town Council will try to solve its budget problems with a raffle in which half the pot goes to the winner and half to Elsmere's general fund.
Robert McWilliams, the town mansger, said he expected the first drawing to generate $200 to $400.
The town, whose budget for 1987 is $925,000, just lost $125,000 through the elimination of the Federal revenue sharing program.

LEAD: Almost 34 years ago James Robert Thompson signed his high school yearbook, ''Jim Thompson, Pres. of U.S. 1984-1992.''


ORIENTAL PORCELAINS IN EUROPEAN MOUNTS
LEAD: Chinese and Japanese porcelains, mounted sparely and sumptuously in gilded and silvered metal mounts, were made to amuse aristocrats over more than six centuries.
Today the charms of these extravagant decorations are enjoyed by enthusiasts from all levels of society, as could be seen on a recent morning in the mix of people filing through the exhibition ''Mounted Oriental Porcelains,'' at the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th

LEAD: Two United States Army colonels have been implicated in efforts to sell arms to Iran for private gain while they were on active duty in sensitive European assignments, one as early as 1983, according to military sources, arms dealers and confidential documents.


GAZEBO SITE
LEAD: A gazebo, proponents say, would enhance the artistic and recreational life of Chappaqua.
It would provide a place for concerts, lectures, exhibits and plays.
It would be esthetically pleasing, would attract audiences to school concerts and would become a focal point for the community.
No one has publicly disagreed; nevertheless, the gazebo has remained only an idea for the last six years, and following the latest rejection of a proposed site, it is likely to remain so longer.


CONCERT: COMPOSERS LEAGUE
LEAD: THE League-I.S.C.M. (a merciful abbreviation of the League of Composers-International Society for Contemporary Music, U.S. Section Inc.) presented a characteristically diverse and engrossing program at Merkin Concert Hall on Thursday night.


How Big A Problem Is the Use of Steroids?
LEAD: I liken the recent steroid scare to the first warnings concerning cigarette smoking.
In the early 1960's, the potential hazards of nicotine were made public.
Most smokers continued to smoke and, in time, passed their dangerous habit to younger generations.
Today, the initial warnings condemning the use of steroids are being similarly ignored.

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD: THESE AMERICAN LANDS: Parks, Wilderness, and the Public Lands.
By Dyan Zaslowsky and the Wilderness Society. (Holt, $22.95.) The voice of Robert Marshall echoes loud in ''These American Lands.'' Marshall was a founder of the Wilderness Society in 1935 and his memory and spirit likely still guide the organization.


IS THE GOOD DEED A DYING SPECIES?
LEAD: I'VE just come back from the supermarket and am trying to reassure myself that I am not a leper, nor (as yet) certifiably insane.
The look on the face of the woman ahead of me in line is still lingering in my mind and insisting that I am one of the above, if not worse.


IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: CLAY WALLS.
By Kim Ronyoung. (Permanent Press, $18.95.) This earnest novel about Korean immigrants begins with a Los Angeles matron and her hired help bent over the rim of a toilet.
The employer is pointing out a missed stain to the plucky Asian heroine, who calls her ungrateful benefactor sangnyun (''low woman'') and tells her where to put the job.


STARTING AT THE SCENE, TEAM SEEKS CLUES TO CAUSE OF DEADLY TRAIN COLLISION
LEAD: When the telephone rang at John Rehor's home near the Potomac River some 50 miles northwest of Washington last Sunday afternoon, the New York Giants were pulling away from the San Francisco 49ers on television. ''It had just started to become a rout,'' he remembered later.


THOSE LITTLE SURPRISES SNOW BRINGS
LEAD: THE first snowfall of the season always takes me by surprise.
Despite endless forecasts and warnings from the ubiquitous weather announcers on radio and the tube, and despite repeated admonitions from the spouse, there is never enough time - for me, at least - to do the things that should be done before it snows.


C.I.A. SAID TO GUIDE CONTRAS' MILITARY DESPITE BAN ON AID
LEAD: Central Intelligence Agency officers in Costa Rica were far more deeply involved than previously acknowledged in advising the Nicaraguan rebels on military and political strategy last year, according to rebel officers, Costa Rican officials and Congressional aides.


POSTING: New Condo for Yorkville; A Midrise Rarity
LEAD: Most of the condominiums to emerge in recent years in Yorkville, the upper stretch of the Upper East Side, have tended to be tall, with 35 stories not uncommon.
But the Louisiana, a new condominium building at 300 East 90th Street, is only 10 stories high.


Miami Airport
LEAD: To the Editor: It is virtually impossible to retain an objective and reasoned viewpoint when discussing the facilities at the Miami airport.
Several months have passed since my latest trauma, but time has done little to lessen the impact.


NOT JUST FOOTBALL BOOMING IN JERSEY MEADOWS
LEAD: After two decades of cleanup and land reclamation, the Meadowlands area of New Jersey is shedding its image as an environmental wasteland and emerging as one of the busiest centers of commercial development in the Northeast.


AUDIO AWARDS UNCOVER GEMS
LEAD: Proverbial truth is debatable.


POETRY-VIDEO AS TOOL KEEPS TRUANTS IN SCHOOL
LEAD: LOUIS BARRIOS used to walk through the hallways of his high school in a fog.
In class, his mind wandered out the window and onto the streets.
A dark shadow hung over his head, but he just didn't know how to put his feelings into words.


THE BUSINESS CYCLE ROLLS OVER AND PLAYS DEAD
LEAD: NOT so long ago, an awesome force known as the business cycle drove the economy along much as the moon drives the tides and the sun the seasons.
It was almost always there, a perpetual motion machine that propelled the nation through booms and busts.
Yet for more than a couple of years now, the cycle has been dormant, with the economy moving listlessly month after month.


Wright Still Calm at Corner
LEAD: THERE he was, running easily around the practice field at the Denver Broncos' training site here, a tall, graceful athlete with a long stride.


OIL DECLINE ADDING TO NIGERIA'S ILLS
LEAD: WHEN the Secretary of State, George P. Shultz, spends a few hours here tomorrow on his eight-day African tour, he will be absorbing impressions of the continent's most populous country and one of its most fractious.
Nigeria, shaken by seven military coups and a civil war in 26 years of independence, appears to be headed for new political stress.


TOPICS: Steps Forward; DR. LIFE LIVES
LEAD: In a poignant poem, ''The Nobel Prize,'' Boris Pasternak wrote in 1959 that he was treated like a bandit by Soviet authorities for ''the vile offense'' of winning the world's most coveted literary honor.
He sought this solace: ''Nonetheless I still believe/ Though I feel my death is near / That the soul of men's goodwill / Will vanquish hate and fear.

NEW YORK THEATER: ISN'T IT ROMANTIC
LEAD: There is a new phenonemnon in New York.
Every night at 7:30 hordes of eager diners pour out of restaurants, from the intimate French bistros of Greenwich Village to the 874-seat ''Only Guacamole'' Yupeterias on the Upper West Side.
Across Manhattan former ''foodies'' are forfeiting a final mousse, and leaving a souffle flat.


ONE LESSON OF SAN JUAN BLAZE: IT COULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE
LEAD: SPECIAL circumstances - a pile of new furniture, weak safety regulation and a poorly equipped, understrength fire department - helped bring the death toll to 96 in the fire New Year's Eve at the Dupont Plaza Hotel.
But safety experts say these factors should not divert Americans from the real lesson to be drawn from the disaster:


REDMAN BEAT BOSTON COLLEGE TO END 2-GAME SLIDE
LEAD: After consecutive laskluster efforts against Villanova and Georgetown, St.
John's came alive and snapped its two-game losing streak last night.
The Redmen survived a sensational shooting performance by Dana Barros and defeated Boston College, 62-58, at Alumni Hall.


FANCY CHICKENS HAVE MANY FANS
LEAD: FRAMED, life-size portraits of chickens hang on the walls of E. Lea Marsh's home in Old Lyme.
About 40 chickens scratch and squawk in their coops in his yard.
And sometimes the birds get their feathers fluffed and their toenails trimmed in his laundry room.


AN OLD QUARTER OF PARIS IS NEW AGAIN
LEAD: The Kingdom of the Down and Out is how the Marais district of Paris was described some 30 years ago.


MUSIC: BOLCOM'S RENDERING OF BLAKE'S 'SONGS'
LEAD: FOR nearly three years, there has been talk of William Bolcom's massive setting, for a Symphony-of-a-Thousand-sized ensemble, of William Blake's complete poetic collection, ''Songs of Innocence and of Experience.'' Finally, Friday night, New Yorkers got a chance to hear this 140-minute score live, courtesy of the Next Wave Festival, Lukas Foss and the Brooklyn Philharmonic, who presented it at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Opera House (the third and final performance is today at 2 P.M.

HOW TO SURVIVE HEALTHFUL FOOD
LEAD: I ORDERED an individual salmon sandwich on whole-wheat toast, no dressing, and orange spice herb tea.
This was a lunch I carefully selected for its low calories and because of the calcium in the salmon, the fiber and wheat in the bread and the absense of tannic acid or caffeine in the tea.
Next to me at the counter, a man ordered a super-deluxe cheeseburger, rare, with french fries and a chocolate malt.

NEW SPEAKER'S NEW GAVEL
LEAD: When the new Speaker of the House, Jim Wright of Texas, gaveled the new Congress to order this week, he did it with an oversized gavel.
It was, of course, a Texas product, and it was given to Mr.
Wright by the Speaker of the Texas House, Gib Lewis.
Both Speakers are from Fort Worth.
Mr.
Wright was given a leadership award last


MUSIC: ISSAC STERN AND FRIENDS AT WEILL HALL
LEAD: THE aim on Friday night was to turn the stage of Weill Recital Hall into a musician's living room.
And so it transpired - at least up to a point.
Isaac Stern had eight of his friends over to play, but this was Hausmusik in name only.
First, there was the fashionably dressed audience (continuing the Recital


ORIGINS OF KAZAKHSTAN RIOTING ARE DESCRIBED
LEAD: The Soviet press began reporting new details this week of the violent anti-Russian rioting last month in the republic of Kazakhstan, and it placed part of the blame on ethnic segregation in local universities.


A POLICY THAT'S FAILED
LEAD: When Adm.
John Poindexter was asked why he had condoned an apparently illegal diversion of funds from the Iranian arms sale to the ''contras'' trying to overthrow the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, President Reagan's former national security adviser is reported to have replied: ''I felt sorry for the contras.


BUCKING THE CLEAN WATER TIDE
LEAD: Fifteen years after the Clean Water Act, many rivers and lakes are still disgracefully polluted with sewage and poisonous chemicals.
Congress ardently desires to make America's waters swimmable and fishable once again.
But President Reagan persists in opposing a bill to renew the Clean Water Act.
The new House has just insisted on this legislation and the new Senate is about to do the same.


CHURCH DESIGN
LEAD: PLANS are under way to rebuild the Hitchcock Presbyterian Church, the Scarsdale landmark that was destroyed in a suspicious fire seven months ago.


NASA MOVE TIED TO BUDGET THREAT
LEAD: A new book says Dr.
James C. Fletcher, head of the space agency, put the Marshall Space Flight Center in charge of the shuttle's ill-fated rockets because Federal budget cutters were threatening to close the Alabama center, not because it had any special expertise in the creation of solid-fuel rockets.


Stepping Up The Contra Battle
LEAD: Amid assertions that they must act decisively and soon, thousands of United States-supported rebels have recently entered Nicaragua, and the Reagan Administration contended last week that the Sandinista Government might yet be overthrown.

Dollars for Saving
LEAD: WHEN he got the results of a survey of salaries in the National Hockey League, Alan Eagleson, the executive director of the N.H.L.
Players Association, thought he had stumbled on a financial anomaly.
Goaltenders, he found, were the lowest-paid players on Canadian teams and the highest-paid on American teams.


DARKNESS DESCENDS ON THE CITY OF LIGHTS
LEAD: LIFE seemed gray and gloomily unpredictable in France last week.
People waited hours for subway trains that never came.
Patients in clinics that lacked emergency power had to do without X-rays.
Stores were lighted by candles, and traffic lights went out, causing colossal tie-ups at major intersections.


Austrian Lederhosen to Weather the Alps
LEAD: In Austria lederhosen are not so much a pair of trousers as a way of life.
Worn summer and winter, casually and as Sunday best, these leather shorts or knickers are passed down from father to son, so that buying lederhosen is an investment that might cost anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars depending upon length (almost kneecap or knicker), embroidery (without or with, machine or hand) and whether the lederhosen is readymade or custom fit.


Cable TV
LEAD: Some classics, including two imports and lesser-known bargains top the film week on cable.
Two Vittorio de Sica imports cited by the New York Film Critics are on Bravo: the raffishly endearing ''Miracle in Milan'' (1951), with its marvelous, skybound fadeout - Tuesday at midnight.; and ''Umberto D'' (1952), a poignant study of an elderly pensioner, with superb performance by Carlo Battista in the central role - 11 P.M.

How Big A Problem Is the Use of Steroids?
LEAD: Whether the use of anabolic steroids should be allowed is controversial; to deny their popularity and desired effect is foolish.
I am amazed at the continued lack of acknowledgement that anabolic steroids increase muscle size and strength.
Maybe there is little evidence to prove this but how many scientific studies have been conducted?


JAPANESE EDUCATION FADES AT THE FINISH
LEAD: AMERICANS hoping to improve education have cast many an envious glance at the Japanese.

Bank Ethics
LEAD: To the Editor:  Before Mr.
Bennett continues to make broad-based accusations of ''scrappy marketing'' and misrepresentation by commercial banks (''Now, the Age of Fast Buck Banking,'' Dec. 14), let him attend a sales training session.
The strong presence of integrity that he will encounter will far outweigh the wrongs some banks have done while entering the ''financial services revolution.

A MARKET WHERE CHEMICAL IS KING
LEAD: *
When one of Chemical Bank's British lending officers was reassigned to Manhattan's garment district not long ago, he began to study more than just the American rag trade.

Immigrants
LEAD: To the Editor:  Barry R. Chiswick (''A Troubling Drop in Immigrant 'Quality', '' Forum, Dec. 21) claims that an immigration policy that favors ''productive applicants'' would ease the competition between America's native minorities and newly arrived unskilled immigrants for low-skilled jobs.


AMARILLO'S ANSWER TO STONEHENGE

LEAD: GEORGE PRATT SHULTZ RAISED HIS HAND in the hushed committee room, took an oath not to lie, and then upbraided the assembled members of Congress.

TRANSIT AGENCY SETS GOALS, AND EVEN MEETS SOME
LEAD: Given the evident difficulties of running New York's subways, as well as the bureaucracy they spawned, it might not seem wise to put 473 goals for the year in writing, much less project them in foot-high letters onto a screen at the front of a crowded auditorium.


N.F.C. CHAMPIONSHIP: GIANTS vs. REDSKINS; Tradition, Pride and Now Glory: Secondary
LEAD: SINCE two-platoon football came to the National Football League in 1950, the Giants, in lean years and good, have been celebrated for their defense.


Corporate Sponsors Climb Aboard
LEAD: FOR a sport that attracts an upscale market, sailboat racing has attracted surprisingly little corporate support in the United States.
That's all starting to change, however, thanks in part to the America's Cup and a recent decision to ease restrictions on advertising on racing boats.


Pretoria and Its Critics Maneuver For Advantage
LEAD: The tactics of resistance to South African apartheid took many forms last week, while the Government of P. W. Botha pursued a strategy aimed at counteracting what it regards as adverse publicity in the United States.

Directed by William Seiter and produced by Pandro S. Berman. 1938.
RKO Home Video. 78 minutes. $29.95.

MARK REVALUATION SOUGHT BY FRANCE
LEAD: France demanded again today that West Germany bear the cost of ending the speculation crisis that erupted on international currency markets last week as the French franc declined and the West German mark soared in value.

RACIST THREATS FAIL TO BREAK EFFORTS FOR A FREEDOM MARCH
LEAD: When Charles A. Blackburn moved to this hilly, rustic North Georgia county five years ago from the San Franciso Bay area, he thought is was a perfect balance: a cabin on a lake in woodsy country just 30 miles north of metropolitan Atlanta.
Mr.Blackburn is a white man, and he did not notice at first, so close to that city of racial harmony, that there were no black people in Forsyth County.


Ms. Aarons, a Writer, Marries Michael Eisele
LEAD: Gabelle Ada Aarons, a writer, and Michael Stewart Eisele, an artist, were married yesterday at Valeur, a historic mansion in Rhinebeck, N.Y., by Town Justice Joseph J. Waters.

Giving Credit To Chamberlain
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:  In the annual review of the year in sports (The New York Times, Dec. 28), Dave Anderson noted that the Celtics' overall record of 82-18, an .820 percentage, was the best in National Basketball Association history.
Actually, two championship teams led by Wilt Chamberlain - the 1971-72 Lakers, who were 81-16 (an .835 percentage), and the 1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers, who were 79-17 (an .823 percentage) - had better records according to winning percentage.


Q and A
LEAD: Releasing the Sponsor  Question: When my apartment building was coverted into a cooperative, the sponsor promised in amendments to the plan to make some repairs, including patching some serious leaks in the parking garage.
Recently, the board of directors gave the sponsor a general release from all claims concerning repairs in exchange for the sponsor's cooperation in renegotiating the building's mortgage at a lower interest rate.


PROTECTION SOUGHT FOR THREE RIVERS
LEAD: THE first bit of business that Senator Bill Bradley and Representative William J.

TEXT OF O'NEILL'S STATE OF STATE ADDRESS
LEAD: Following is Governor O'Neill's State of the State Address to the General Assembly on Wednesday, as transcribed by The Associated Press:


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
LEAD: NO PARKING RANDY GOTTLIEB, a senior at Great Neck North High School, may have the definitive answer to the school's lack of student parking space: The family chauffeur delivers him to and from school each day in a limousine.


THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER
LEAD: WITH the release last year of the Macintosh Plus, it looks as if Apple is beginning to make real inroads on business computing.
The current dominance of the I.B.M. standard has thrust into virtual oblivion the fact that brokers, insurance agents and financial analysts snapped up the original Apple II to computerize their work on their own individual machines.


ARE VOTERS ENTITLED TO REAGAN'S DIAGNOSIS?
LEAD: PRESIDENT REAGAN is back at the White House, recuperating from his third major operation since his inauguration, his second in 18 months.

Submarine Strategy
LEAD: Richard Halloran notes in his article that ''the battleship dominated naval operations in World War I.''


NEW JERSEY JOURNAL

INFIGHTING HURTS TAMILS' CAUSE IN INDIA
LEAD: In a major development in the Sri Lankan civil war, infighting among rival Tamil rebel groups has begun to anger India and damage the guerrillas' reputation in the eyes of sympathizers.


A NEW SETTING FOR L'AMBROISIE
LEAD: Throughout his career, the Parisian chef and restaurateur Bernard Pacaud has lived by three common-sense rules: Keep the restaurant small, keep the menu simple, make sure the food is fresh.
Those rules managed to win him two Michelin stars in a very short time, and so it only made sense that when he outgrew his nine-table restaurant, L'Ambroisie, on the Left Bank, the new one would follow the same principles.


HOW THE GIANTS LIFTED THEIR GAME
LEAD: IN the far corner of the Giants' locker room, beyond the trainer's room, beyond the equipment room, beyond the washers and the dryers, is their big brightly lighted weight room.
It is here that the Giants players, quite literally, have lifted themselves into today's National Conference championship game.


ECONOMIC GAINS FOUND SOFTER IN NEW YORK AREA
LEAD: Although the economy of the New York-New Jersey region continued to grow last year - adding 135,000 jobs -a report released last week said that several suburban counties were beginning to show some signs of decreased economic strength.


MARINE WHO SERVED IN MOSCOW EMBASSY HELD IN SPY INQUIRY
LEAD: A Marine guard who had access to classified documents in the United States Embassy in Moscow is being held on suspicion of espionage after confessing he gave secrets to a female K.G.B. agent, Defense Department sources said today.

LEAD: WITH advances in health-care contributing to longer lives, the market for barrier-free and assisted-living housing for the elderly has steadily increased.


ON NEED FOR HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE
LEAD: The article on the Dec. 28 Opinion Page by Joyce M. Lannert on zoning  [ ''How Can Zoning Be Used to Create Housing Options?'' ]  is of great interest, not only to me, but to all who are in need of affordable housing in our county.

CARLESIMO STARTS TO LOOKUP
LEAD: PJ.
Carlesimo had sort of curled up at one end of the gymnasium, his knees tucked tightly under his chin, his back resting stiffly against a padded wall, as he studied the workout that unfolded before him.
In the past few days, there had been a victory of great importance and a defeat of great disappointment, and these were two things that Carlesimo could not fully dispatch from his mind as he watched his Seton Hall basketball team practice the other day.


Miss Mazie Engaged To Robert M. Cohen
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Lowell I. Mazie of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Linda Sue Mazie, to Robert Martin Cohen, the son of Mr. and Mrs.

Miss Mazie is director of residential services at the Boston Center for Residential Living.


THE 100TH CONGRESS IS FULL OF PARTISAN RISK
LEAD: AT the outset of the 100th Congress last week, the leaders tried to strike a bipartisan chord.
The new Democratic Speaker, Jim Wright of Texas, told the House of Representatives, ''We seek not confrontation but cooperation.'' At almost the same moment, Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader in the Senate, was saying, ''It is necessary that we start off on a totally nonpartisan, bipartisan basis.


Jazz
LEAD: Whenever two or more jazz musicians get together to play the same instrument on the same stage, tradition dictates a ''battle,'' an evening of virtuosic muscle-flexing and crowd-pleasing.
The ''Trumpet Summit'' at Fat Tuesday's this week looks more complementary than competetive, though, and that's a good sign.


POST-COLONIAL OPPRESSORS

CONNECTICUT GUIDE
LEAD: BRASS RUBBINGS Brass rubbing is an old craft that produces quickly and easily a respectable piece of art at minimal cost.
It requires no artistic skill and is an enjoyable way to spend half an hour or so.
Those who have never tried it may treat themselves to an introductory workshop under the watchful eyes of experts from the Brass Rubbing Center in London and its branch in Washington D.C., courtesy of the Museum of Art, Science and Industry in


INDIAN FARE ADDS SOME OF SPICE OF LIFE
LEAD: FOR Christmas this year an enterprising friend gave me a large basket filled with Indian spices in small bags tied with ribbon.
Of course, as soon as I smelled it, I craved Indian food.
For the next two weeks, the house was filled with the warm, musky aroma of an Indian bazaar as I set about cooking my favorite dishes and tried some new ones.


THE TIMES APPOINTS A.O. SULZBERGER JR. ASSISTANT PUBLISHER
LEAD: Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. has been named to the newly created position of assistant publisher of The New York Times.
The appointment, effective Jan. 19, was announced yesterday by his father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of the newspaper and chairman and chief executive officer of The New York Times


Immigrants
LEAD: To the Editor:  Mr.
Chiswick's contention that the amnesty provisions of the Simpson-Rodino Immigration Reform Act will make ''illegal aliens ... more likely to become a permanent feature of the labor market ...'' simply ignores the fact that the group to which amnesty applies is already a permanent feature of the labor market.


CORRECTION
LEAD: A picture caption last Sunday in Portfolio of '86, the special Year in Review section, misstated the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.
He was born on Jan. 15, 1929, and the birthday is observed as a national holiday on the third Monday of January.


An F.A.A. Reply
LEAD: To the Editor:  Neither William F. Bolger nor Jack A. Blum have properly defined the problems in aviation (''Breaking a Budgetary Logjam,'' Forum, Dec. 7).
For example, Mr.
Blum refers to the ''continuing erosion of the margin of safety.'' No one has ever defined what ''margin of safety'' is, let alone figured out how to measure it.


Making a Grim Case for Precious Metals
LEAD: WHILE most eyes are again on Wall Street, as the Dow finally broke the magical 2,000 level, some experts argue that recent stirrings of life in precious metals prices may portend tougher times ahead for stocks and bonds.


POP: BUFFY SAINTE-MARIE
LEAD: OF the many socially engaged singer-songwriters who emerged out of the folk music movement of the 1960's, few have offered a more clearly focused vision of injustice than Buffy Sainte-Marie, the longtime crusader for American Indian rights.


A Trucker Surrenders After a Queens Crash
LEAD: A 26-year-old Brooklyn truck driver who fled from an accident that left two people seriously injured in Queens Friday surrendered to the police yesterday.
His lawyer said the suspect fled because a passer-by had fired gunshots he thought were aimed at him.

LEAD: Among the more familiar sights on Cape Cod this winter are the ''Help Wanted'' signs in virtually all the large supermarkets, department stores, pharmacies and restaurant chains, from Sandwich to Orleans.


How Big A Problem Is the Use of Steroids?
LEAD: Just how big a problem steroid use is among the professional athletes can only be determined through mutually agreed-upon testing procedures.

What would the consequences of steroid use be - suspension?


More About 'Marilyn'
LEAD: To the Editor:
I enjoyed Diana Trilling's review of ''Marilyn'' by Gloria Steinem (Dec. 21) and would like to add some relevant information of which Mrs.
Trilling may not have been aware.


IN TODAY'S OPERA WORLD STARS CAN CALL THE TUNE
LEAD: The first thing to understand about bidding for the services of opera's superstars is that it's a singer's market.
There are far, far more blank slots on opera house calendars waiting to be filled by a Domingo or a Freni than there are nights in Placido Domingo's or Mirella Freni's datebooks waiting to be filled by an opera engagement.


Miss Roberts To Be Bride
LEAD: Dr. and Mrs.
Albert Dee Roberts of Dallas have announced the engagement of their daughter, Hillary Roberts, to Peter Alan Rinfret, the son of Dr. and Mrs.
Pierre A. Rinfret of New York.
The wedding is planned for March 21.


IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA, RITUALS OF ANOTHER AGE
LEAD: One of the last purchases I made in Papua New Guinea was a man's pocketbook.
Clutch-shaped, it was deftly fashioned from natural-colored, dried sago palm fibers and worked in a herringbone pattern.
But what clinched the sale were the decorations.
To avert the potential hazard posed by the two sharp wooden sticks framing the mouth of the purse, the weaver had swaddled them in bubble-gum wrappers.


Boos or Cheers?
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:  Does booing a professional athlete help or hinder his performance?


ENHANCED TV STANDARDS STILL ELUSIVE
LEAD: At the outset of a new year, engineering executives entrusted with long-range planning invariably wax eloquent about things to come.
In television, they usually tell us that everything is obsolete, that we ought to chuck the whole system and start from scratch.


Low Profile
LEAD: HE'S an assistant athletic director with an established interest in basketball and some of the best seats in the school arena, but Lefty Driesell hasn't used them to watch Maryland play this season.

FOR THE ATHLETES
LEAD: The United States Postal Service will issue a commemorative stamp Jan. 29 to honor the Tenth Pan American Games.
The sports competition will be held in 23 sites throughout Indiana from Aug. 7 to 25.
The first day of issue ceremony will be held in Indianapolis, the site for many events.


Biotech's Stalled Revolution
LEAD: Many people in the medical community are relieved to hear that the ''Biotech revolution'' has stalled (''Biotech's Stalled Revolution,'' by Keith Schneider, Nov. 16).
The danger of inadvertently creating new pathogens against which we have no effective treatment and no innate immune defense far outweighs the touted benefits of this technology.


THE NETWORKS ARE RE-MEASURING THE MINI-SERIES
LEAD: Whether fighting for their honor, their lovers or their fabulous multinational companies, the heroes and heroines of mini-series are in unusual jeopardy this year: Viewers have become bored with their problems.
Except for Linda Evans as an American woman facing the Australian outback in ''The Last Frontier,'' ratings for these special events have ranged from disastrous (''George Washington: The Forging of a Nation'') to mediocre (''A Year in the Life.


A French 'Riposte' In Chad's War
LEAD: France and Libya crossed an important line in Chad last week.
Libyan planes bombed two towns south of the 16th parallel, the so-called Red Line established by French forces as the southern boundary for Libyan incursions.
In retaliation, French jets bombed an airstrip in Libyan-controlled territory.

But only on certain days.


ABOUT BOOKS
LEAD: OF THE 40,000 to 60,000 books published each year, many address a particular need (for example, how to raise a child successfully).


PROGRESS MAY NOT, AFTER ALL, BE OUR MOST IMPORTANT PRODUCT
LEAD: Communities confused or discontent in the present often strongly rediscover the moral and spiritual meaning of the traditional objects of their past.
This has usually been associated with so-called ''traditional'' societies - certainly not industrial ones.
Recently, however, the inexorable recognition that the technology of the industrial system is not a surefire solution to all life's problems has, in a strange paradox, begun to focus broad and appreciative attention on the old ''classical'' objects of the industrial way.


Business Sense
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:  In response to Marvin Miller's charge that George Steinbrenner was part of an owner conspiracy not to sign Jack Morris as a free agent, Steinbrenner is quoted as saying: ''If Marvin Miller can run a business better than me, then he should be rich.
And he's not.''


Children at the Art Museum
LEAD: To the Editor:
Our new book, ''Visiting the Art Museum,'' obviously made your reviewer, Grace Glueck (Dec. 21), very uncomfortable.
It is a children's book after all, not an adult guide as she seems to assume.
And it is just Ms.
Glueck's didactic attitude toward the mix of children and art museums we are trying to dispel with this book.


MAINE LEGISLATURE IS URGED TO BAN TESTING BY EMPLOYERS FOR DRUG USE
LEAD: A special panel has urged the State Legislature to prohibit companies from testing employees or job applicants for drug use.


SATIRE'S BARB JABS JAPAN'S TV NEWS

Page Stevens Plans to Wed
LEAD: A May wedding is planned by Page Van Brunt Stevens, an account officer in the New York City real-estate division of the Chase Manhattan Bank, and John Dixon Knox, a portfolio manager for Morgan Stanley Asset Management Inc. in New York.


Binghams
LEAD: To the Editor:  I was saddened to read your story about the Binghams (''The Binghams, After the Fall,'' Dec. 21), not by their plight - for they are strangers to me - but by what has happened to one of my favorite newspapers, The Louisville Courier-Journal.


DEVILS SALVAGE A TIE (AGAIN)
LEAD: After their second consecutive tie, this time 2-2 with the Vancouver Canucks today at Byrne Meadowlands Arena, the Devils were without a victory in their last 10 games.
But they viewed the streak from a practical perspective.


BOSTON COMPUTERS: A USERS' DECADE
LEAD: Jonathan Rotenberg, president of the Boston Computer Society, tells a story about the day he met Steven Jobs, co-founder of Apple Computer.

Mr.
Rotenberg asked why. ''Jobs said,'' Mr.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Jesse Helms Protests
LEAD: It was interesting that R. W. Apple Jr.'s article ''Delivering the South'' (Nov. 30), offered glowing identifications of Democrats, liberals and blacks.
But how was Jesse Helms identified?
Oh, he is merely a ''former radio announcer.''


THE FIRST WEEK ON CAPITOL HILL
LEAD: Select committees were established in both houses to investigate the sale of weapons to Iran and the diversion of money to the Nicaraguan rebels, or contras.


HOBBLING REAGAN'S TRILLION-DOLLAR 'DRAGON'
LEAD: THE zeal and fervor, the secrecy and surprise that used to surround President Reagan's budgets gave way last week to a note of fatalism as his seventh annual blueprint for Federal spending went to Congress.


VIEWS OF NATURE ON EXHIBIT AT RIDGEFIELD'S EXPANDED ALDRICH
LEAD: EVEN when the Aldrich Museum in Ridgefield, was confined to one building, a handsome Colonial structure at 258 Main Street, its productions were not to be taken in at a glance.
Now with its new wing, so cunningly grafted on by a Wilton architectural firm, Robert Faesy Associates, the exhibition space is almost twice what it was.


FUNDS FOR ROAD REPAIRS IMPERILED
LEAD: WHILE vehicular bridges and roadways in New Jersey continue to deteriorate faster than they can be repaired, funds for repairs are in danger of drying up by June, according to the state's Department of Transportation.


TENANT'S LAWSUIT COULD HELP UPGRADE HOUSING
LEAD: FAIR-HOUSING advocates say that a case now before the courts could help provide a remedy for the problem of substandard housing on Long Island.


ON LANGUAGE
LEAD: DON'T CROWD ME; I'm distancing myself from the hottest cliche in Scandalville.


COUNTY IN SEARCH OF THREE PRIZE-WINNING PLAYWRIGHTS
LEAD: IF, indeed, ''everyone has a play in him somewhere,'' as County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke suggests, the Office of Cultural Affairs in White Plains may be deluged with manuscripts from aspiring dramatists before the end of the month.

Koch-Cuomo Aid To the Homeless
LEAD: IT began as a parody of the television program ''Miami Vice'' in the June 1986 issue of Penthouse magazine.
The parody, titled ''New York Vice,'' displayed caricatures of Mayor Koch and Governor Cuomo, packing guns and looking menacing.


MCFARLANE TOOK CAKE AND BIBLE TO TEHERAN, EX-C.I.A. MAN SAYS
LEAD: A retired Central Intelligence Agency official has confirmed to the Senate Intelligence Committee that on the secret mission to Teheran last May, Robert C. McFarlane and his party carried a Bible with a handwritten verse from President Reagan for Iranian leaders.


NAKASONE STARTS TRIP TO FINLAND AND EAST BLOC
LEAD: Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone left today for Finland and Eastern Europe, a weeklong journey that seems to be part diplomatic overture, part consolation prize.


City Taxes
LEAD: To the Editor:  Your Dec. 14 article on Woodhaven, Queens  [ ''If You're Thinking of Living in Woodhaven'' ]  says that houses there selling for $150,000 to $300,000 have taxes ranging from $600 and $1,200 a year, which means they are assessed at less than 5 percent of market value.


Photography
LEAD: Ten years ago, Virginia Zabriskie took a leap of faith and opened a Paris branch of her Zabriskie Gallery, which she devoted exclusively to photography.
Situated in the shadow of the Centre George Pompidiou, the elegant and intimate Galerie Zabriskie has presented the work of American photographers such as Harry Callahan and Lee Friedlander to a European audience.


Chiefs Name Coach
LEAD: FRANK GANSZ was named the Kansas City Chiefs' head coach last night.
The 48-year-old Gansz succeeds John Mackovic, who was dismissed Thursday despite the Chiefs' 10-6 regular-season record in his fourth season and Kansas City's first playoff appearance in 15 years.


CONCERT: GUARNERI QUARTET
LEAD: THE Guarneri String Quartet is among the smoothest and most elegant of chamber ensembles, yet the group's Wednesday evening concert at Alice Tully Hall was only sporadically successful.


SEEKING THE PULSE OF THE ISLAND
LEAD: IT always makes me laugh to see a segment on a national news program in which the correspondent signs off, ''And this is so-and-so reporting from Long Island, New York.''


Alert Out on Pacemaker Wires
LEAD: Two models of wires used in heart pacemakers have been malfunctioning at higher than normal rates, according to the manufacturer, which says the problem is not life-threatening to the hundreds of Americans with the devices.

New York: Viking. $24.95.


NO EASING OF EXIT VISA BATTLES FOR MANY IN SOVIET
LEAD: In the last two weeks, Naum Meiman has made many visits to Soviet Government offices, spending hours in the bitter cold chasing evanescent assurances that the next piece of paper he obtains will secure the promised exit visa for his cancer-stricken wife.


The Frustration Factor in Vacation-Club Bargains
LEAD: Searching for the best deal in a cruise or tour can be a laborious and frustrating chore that may make you wonder, in the end, whether any money saved was worth the effort.


THE IRAN-CONTRA INFORMATION CURVE
LEAD: The White House is so eager to demonstrate that President Reagan didn't know about transferring Iranian arms money to the Nicaraguan rebels that it releases, and urges the Senate Intelligence Committee to release, humiliating evidence of its foreign policy ineptitude.
To prove that he is no knave, Mr.


Putting a Career On Hold
LEAD: What is this, female chauvinism?
Aren't there any fathers who are interested in taking care of their children?
It is good to hear that Procter &amp; Gamble, at least, has paternity leave.
I hope the idea catches on, and fast.


Bad Bosses
LEAD: To the Editor:  ''When the Boss Is Unbearable'' (Dec. 28) omits discussion of why a boss acts that way.
If the employee can understand the boss's motives there is a wider choice available than quitting the job or saying, ''When you...I feel...''


Mexico by Bus
LEAD: To the Editor: The question in the Nov. 9 Q &amp; A column regarding intercity bus travel in Mexico struck a chord.


Redskins Battling Destiny
LEAD: No need to belabor the obvious: Everybody knows that the Giants had a great season, that they beat the Washington Redskins twice, that Joe Morris ran free the first time they played this season, that Lawrence Taylor ran wild the second time, that now they are playing for a third time, in the National


AGENCIES GET HELP FOR DATA
LEAD: A PAIR of computer professionals began an unlikely charity two years ago -giving computers and computer instruction to nonprofit agencies around the state.

LEGISLATORS AWAIT KEY KEAN TALK
LEAD: WHEN Governor Kean delivers his State of the State Message to the Legislature Tuesday, he will be firing the opening gun of what promises to be the most politically charged year in the Senate and Assembly in more than a decade.


AFTER CHURCH: PORTRAITS OF A PROUD BLACK COMMUNITY
LEAD: THE photographer stood in the midday summer sun.
Her subjects posed in the shade, standing or sitting in the doorway of the First Baptist Church in Riverhead, before a blank, black paper screen that sometimes wafted and billowed in a breeze.


NEW YORKERS, ETC.
LEAD: IT'S pretty hard, maybe even impossible, not to hate them, but we've got to try.
After all, it isn't their fault that they happen to have one of two gifts that are impossible to learn and that money can't buy.
The gift is there or it isn't, that's all there is to it, and there's no point saying, ''Why not me?


RECENT CASSETTES
LEAD: The Streisand Specials: My Name Is Barbra and Color Me Barbra.
CBS/Fox Video. 60 minutes. $29.95.
Barbra Streisand's landmark CBS television specials in the mid-60's turned the star of the Broadway show ''Funny Girl'' into a household face as well as a household voice.
Both shows, staged by Joe Layton, are unrelenting star vehicles in which the singer, then in her mid-20's, paraded front and center, without the support of famous guests.


NO PIZZA CONNECTION
LEAD: To the Editor:


More Champions
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:  Although I enjoyed the champions listed in the 1986 sports review section, I noticed it failed to include the National Collegiate Athletic Association women's volleyball champions.
If there was room to list the men's winners, I'm sure there was room for the women's team - which, by the way, was the University of the Pacific, in Stockton, Calif.

LEAD: Michael Jordan scored 31 points and Charles Oakley added 21 tonight, leading the Chicago Bulls to a 119-109 victory over the Nets.

Paul also faces charges that he and his son, John Paul Jr., conspired to smuggle 200,000 pounds of cocaine into the United States between 1975 and 1983.


Funerals
LEAD: To the Editor:  ''What's New in the Funeral Business'' (Dec. 14) made no reference to the country's 150 Memorial Societies.
These are consumer-controlled, non-profit organizations that help their 250,000 members plan in advance the service and disposition of body they want.
Some societies negotiate low prices with funeral homes; others simply collect prices for a set of simple funerals.


Jacqui Mitchell, a New Number One
LEAD: Baseball fans are told within seconds when Pete Rose breaks a long-standing batting record, but in bridge everything is more leisurely.
Unofficial calculations strongly indicate that the title of world's top-ranked woman player changed hands in September, but the World Bridge Federation does not appear to have noticed this, let alone revealed the fact to a waiting world or the players involved.


DEATH HALTS FAIRFIELD GAME
LEAD: The basketball game between Fordham and Fairfield was suspended with 1 minute 42 seconds remaining today when the grandmother of one of the Fairfield players collapsed and died in the stands, officials said.


PURSUIT OF CULTURE AT A YOUNG AGE
LEAD: MY mother was born in a tough section of Chicago, near the Loop.
To her, this was a nonpareil social blight.
It had to be erased at all costs.
My mother's solution took the form of a frantic, lifetime pursuit of culture as she understood it.

U.S. Peace Garden In Washington?
LEAD: EVEN though Washington seems overrun with memorials and the Federal Government says it is running out of space for new ones, Representative George Miller, a California Democrat, said he had substantial support for his proposal: a national peace garden in the capital.


IMPROVISERS ARE FINDING NEW MIXES
LEAD: ''It's all in the mix - this is true of much 80's art,'' Bruce Sterling wrote recently in an essay intended to come to terms with trends and directions in the media culture of the present decade.


SPEED IS NEEDED ON TAX REFORM
LEAD: THERE are very few problems confronting local government in New Jersey that cannot be traced directly to the state's onerous system of property taxation.
And there should be no higher priority for the Governor and the Legislature than to find solutions for it.


N.A.A.C.P. DEFENDS ACTIONS BY WARD
LEAD: Leaders of the nation's oldest black civil-rights organization yesterday staunchly defended Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward's handling of the attack on three blacks by a group of whites in Howard Beach, Queens.

By Garry Wills.
Illustrated. 472 pp.
New York: Doubleday &amp; Company. $19.95.


Some Surprising Allies in Lebanon
LEAD: In the surreal world of Lebanese politics, yesterday's blood-feuding enemies seem willing at times to suppress their memories and join forces.
Over the years, both Christians and Moslems have zigzagged, sometimes allied and at other times contesting each other and such powerful outsiders as Syria, Israel and Yasir Arafat's Palestinians.


Dance
LEAD: The Joyce Sampler lives up to its name as it continues this week at the Joyce with an assortment of six modern dance companies that is about as varied as the New York dance scene.
Mitchell Rose and Diane Epstein open the week on Tuesday with a program that includes some comic classics by the madcap Mr.


Submarine Strategy
LEAD: In his article ''A Silent Battle Surfaces'' (Dec. 7), Richard Halloran quotes a United States Navy admiral as saying that forward-attacks by American submarines on Soviet subs would reduce ''the attractiveness  [ to the Russians ]  of nuclear escalation by changing the nuclear balance in our favor.'' What neither the admiral nor Mr.


Plan of Attack: Morris Is Focus
LEAD: Coach Bill Parcells of the Giants has said it over and over.
The way to win football games is to run the ball when you have it and to stop the opponents from running it when they have it.


CORRECTION
LEAD: The acrostic puzzle in The Times Magazine today includes a construction error.
In the word to be guessed for clue T, letter 24 fits the literary quotation correctly, but must be replaced by ''R'' to fit the book title.

DON'T WEEP FOR THE WILLOW
LEAD: THE weeping willow at our house was a constant annoyance from spring until late fall, when family life turned reluctantly indoors.

Putting New Pep Into Sailboat Sales
LEAD: EVERYONE agrees that sailboats don't sell as well as they once did.
But ask about reasons or solutions, and the agreement ends.
Some suggest the slump is temporary.
Others say the industry needs drastic change.


WEALTH OF A CITY SHOULD BE MEASURED IN PEOPLE
LEAD: THE announcement four years ago that New Haven ranked among the nation's 10 poorest cities sent officals there scurrying for explanations and solutions.
Millions had been invested to fight poverty in this, the model for the Great Society.
The Mayor quickly formed a Poverty Commission.


WHEN WILL IT END?
LEAD: IN the tormented inner world of Giant fans, it is still the long, hot summer of 1969 and they are still singing ''Goodbye Allie.'' These poor souls still fall into a tortured sleep at night watching Mike Battle of the despised Jets hurdling the crouched, frozen bodies of Giant tacklers.


THE 1987 CONCERT SEASON MOVES INTO HIGH GEAR
LEAD: WHETHER your preference is for solo recitals, chamber music or orchestral programs, you have quite a choice this afternoon.

Franco Zeffirelli's Dedication
LEAD: To the Editor:  I enjoyed Steven M. L. Aronson's review of ''Zeffirelli: The Autobiography of Franco Zeffirelli'' (Dec. 14).
I'm quite sure Mr.
Aronson picked out all the highlights and saved me 358 pages of reading, as well as $19.95.


SMOKING BANS BEING EASED IN
LEAD: IN NEW JERSEY, where the right of the nonsmoker to breathe clean air supersedes the right of the smoker to smoke, it is a punishable offense to light up at the wrong place and time.


CITY VISITORS ADD TO FUND FOR NEEDIEST
LEAD: Saying that their visit to New York had made them aware that ''the need for charity is not limited to our doorstep,'' Lilly and David Zohary of Israel have donated $100 to the 75th annual appeal of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.


SUNDAY OBSERVER
LEAD: YEARS AGO, A WRITER named Alexander King went on Jack Paar's late-night television show and zoomed to the top of the best-seller list.
It was a terrible moment in the history of literature.


UNCLOGGING A TOILET: PLUNGERS AND AUGERS
LEAD: ALTHOUGH chemical drain cleaners often work well on clogged sinks, they seldom help a clogged toilet much.


CORRECTION
LEAD: A photograph on Dec. 21 of Phangnga Bay, Thailand, was incorrectly credited.

LAWMAKERS SEEK TO ADD U.S. JUDGE
LEAD: THE Connecticut Congressional delegation is hoping that Democratic control of the 100th Congress will spur passage of legislation that would provide a seventh Federal judgeship in the state.


London Sales
LEAD: To the Editor: In Marilyn Bender's article about the post-Christmas sales in London's department stores (Travel, Nov. 30), she ended with some advice on the V.A.T. incurred in most purchases.
Experience has taught me that the business of V.A.T. refunds can be frustrating, at best.

It Has Declined, But Still Not Enough
LEAD: WITH the United States trade deficit remaining stubbornly high, controversy has arisen about whether the dollar has fallen as far as the standard indexes say it has.
Some analysts contend that the dollar has fallen hardly at all from its February 1985 peak, which explains the continuing large deficits.

LEAD: To the Editor:  Mr.
Pearlman's article gave the exact picture of what is happening to the brush industry.


A BRITISH FARCE WITH A BROAD WINK
LEAD: ''KEY FOR TWO,'' by John Chapman and Dave Freeman, being presented by the Arena Players, is a frothy, amoral sex farce designed for those who like their theatrical entertainment broad and uncomplicated.


DESIGNING AN ETHICAL FRAME FOR MOTHERHOOD BY CONTRACT
LEAD: ''SURROGATE mother'' seemed a cruelly clinical euphemism last week as competing parents fought over a baby in a New Jersey courtroom.
The legal drama was distinctly modern, but the agony of the actors could have been chanted by a Greek chorus.


Headliners; Civilian Royalty
LEAD: Apparently life at the Royal Marine commando training camp was not too tough for Prince Edward, just too - well, common.
There was quite a stir in Britain last week when word leaked out that the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II was considering quitting the year-long commando course only four months after starting it.


LANGUAGE IS SMARTER THAN WE ARE
LEAD: I THINK it is past time to put aside other business and to turn our energies to the remystification of virtually everything.
I am as firmly persuaded as anyone that things can be explained, or usefully described, but I am convinced that our methods at this point are crude, and premature, and that they lead us to ignore such experience or intuition as cannot be accommodated by them.


TIME, AS SHAKESPEARE KNEW, IS RELATIVE
LEAD: To the Editor:


'SAVE THE ROLLS': RULES FOR THE FLORIDA VISIT
LEAD: MY mother has become a ''snowbird.'' She flew to Florida before the first snowflake fell on Long Island, and she's not returning home until spring.

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD: CELEBRATING BIRD: The Triumph of Charlie Parker.
By Gary Giddins. (Beech Tree/Morrow, $15.95.) Charlie (Yardbird) Parker, coming out of Kansas City, Kan., in the Depression, struggled in Harlem to find a voice on saxophone.

Florida Amusement Park, Pacific Mushroom Lore
LEAD: It's Boardwalk And Baseball In Orlando Now


Jamaica's Ackee and Callaloo
LEAD: Most Jamaican hotels routinely include a few native dishes on their menus or offer a Jamaican buffet one night a week.
The authentic tastes of Jamaica - aromatic vegetable stews, spicy meats and fish - are best sampled, however, on the oilcloth-covered tables in small roadside and beach stands.


Portrait of a Power Broker Without the Power
LEAD: As legislators streamed into town for the start of the 100th Congress, James Robert Jones, for almost 25 years one of this town's political power brokers, contemplated sleeping late and catching up on his reading.
He was out of it, no longer a member of the House of Representatives.


Headliners; Hidden Asset
LEAD: Dashiell Hammett, who died a quarter-century ago owing the Government $100,000 in back taxes, apparently had something in the bank after all.
Among the papers of Mr.
Hammett, whose many detective novels include ''The Maltese Falcon'' and ''The Thin Man,'' curators at the University of Texas have found a half-dozen unpublished stories and many stories that never appeared in English.


For Baseball Fans
LEAD: It isn't easy to be a major league baseball fan in Washington.
Since the Senators left town in 1971 to become the Texas Rangers, only an occasional unsanctioned contest, usually between creaking old-timers, has raised any diamond dust at R.F.K.
Stadium.
But now local fans of the New York Mets are excited because their World Champions have been booked into R.F.K.


High Technology
LEAD: To the Editor:  For over 35 years we have closely watched the short- and long-term effects of marketing American technology abroad, mainly through licensing (''The U.S. Giveaway,'' Dec. 7).
More than any other nation we have generously offered our technology to outsiders.
As a result, the entire world has been able to advance the automation of assembly line manufacturing, as well as the handling and processing of material.


WHAT'S NEW IN PLEASURE BOATING
LEAD: THE America's Cup challenge has brought new excitement - and new revenue - to sailing, and focused the eyes of the boating world on Australia.
But the overwhelming message of the New York National Boat Show that winds up today at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center is that America's weekend sailors are still motorboat-mad.


Submarine Strategy
LEAD: Richard Halloran's portrayal of the submarine-stalking games played by the United States and the Soviet Union sounds as if it's right off some admiral's drawing board.
But his omission of any mention of the recent severe collision between an American nuclear submarine and a Russian counterpart does little to warn the public of the peacetime dangers of this ''cat and mouse'' technique.


NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS FEAR I.R.S. PROPOSALS ON LOBBYING
LEAD: Nonprofit organizations fear that new proposals by the Internal Revenue Service will curb lobbying they have done for years to help shape government policies about anything from health and welfare, education and family planning to the environment and the needs of the young or the aged.

LEAD: Since William J. Casey's surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor Dec. 18, the conviction has been growing that his eventful tenure as Director of Central Intelligence would end soon.


CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT COMPANY FINDS WORD-OF-MOUTH HELPS BUSINESS
LEAD: FIVE years ago, the Long Island Weekly examined the rapid rise and success of several entrepreneurs in an article headlined ''They're 'Making It' on Long Island.'' The entrepreneurs, in such fields as real estate and construction, electronics and horticulture, were achieving spectacular success while the national economy had its ups and downs.


Leslie Safford Engaged
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Theodore R. Safford of Gardiner, Me., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Leslie Anne Safford, to Claude Robert Spiro, a son of Robert Spiro and Elaine R. Spiro of Great Neck, L.I.

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD: FIRST DOWN AND A BILLION: The Funny Business of Pro Football.
By Gene Klein and David Fisher (Morrow, $17.95.) If you have never heard of George Halas, Don Coryell or Dan Fouts then you can stiff-arm Gene Klein's breezy story of what it's like to own your own National Football League team.

There, by pre-arrangement, he meets his boss's sexy young wife, Sylvia (Isabelle Huppert), who's also managed to slip away from the festivities.


Deng Versus Deng in China
LEAD: Suddenly, China is torn by political crisis.

VATICAN MUST DEAL EVEN FOR SMALL GAINS IN THE EAST
LEAD: IN a front-page photograph last week, L'Osservatore Romano showed Pope John Paul II standing soberly beside the equally unsmiling Gen.

BANFF'S RICH VEIN OF NATIVE CRAFTS
LEAD: Banff, the resort in the Canadian Rockies long acclaimed for its natural beauty, has over the last decade or so emerged as a center for native arts and crafts.
Shops emphasizing Canadiana, from Eskimo carvings to bronze sculptures, from paintings to jewelry incorporating native stones, have been profilerating along Banff Avenue, in the arcades off it and in the cavernous regions of the Banff Springs


A BRITISH MUSEUM'S CHOICE: ACQUISITIONS OVER 13 YEARS
LEAD: In the National Gallery in London there can be seen through Feb. 15 an exhibition that marks the retirement of Sir Michael Levey, who was director of the National Gallery from 1973 though 1986 and had spent his entire working life on its staff.
Though restricted to 38 paintings, ''Director's Choice: Selected Acquisitions 1973-1986'' cuts a swath that runs in time from 1325 (three panels by the Sienese painter Ugolino di Nerio) to 1904 (a portrait by Gustav Klimt) and 1908 (a portrait by Henri

FRENCH HOSTAGE SEIZED
LEAD: Terry Waite, the Anglican Church envoy, returned to Beirut last week seeking the release of more hostages.
But his visit was the occasion for another kidnapping.
Gunmen seized Roger Auque, a French free-lance reporter and photographer, not long after he finished photographing Mr.
Waite on the seafront in Moslem West Beirut.


Yale Beats Columbia
LEAD: Yale converted 15 of 16 foul shots in the final two minutes to earn a 76-66 Ivy League victory over Columbia tonight.


A NOVELIST AS POLITICIAN
LEAD: Quick now, who was the last bona fide Presidential candidate - one with a chance to win - to have written a novel?
Did any President do so, before or after the White House?


IRAQIS ASSERT THEY BOMBED KHOMEINI'S HOME
LEAD: Iraq asserted today that it had bombed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's home in Teheran, and Iran said its troops were continuing to make gains in heavy fighting near the main southern Iraqi city of Basra.


Jazz
LEAD: Since Gerry Mulligan, the baritone and soprano saxophonist who is also an arranger, organized his 13-piece Concert Jazz Band in 1960, it has been an on-again, off-again part of his career.
The original Concert Jazz Band was active until 1967 when Mr.
Mulligan gave it up because, he said, ''it got to be taken for granted, like an old shoe.


SIX SLAYINGS STIR ANXIETY IN CAPITAL
LEAD: The discoveries of the bodies of six young black women has set off a police search crossing state lines and has aroused anxiety among the capital area's blacks.

POUNDING ON THE OLD HOUSE
LEAD: NOW that 'tis no longer the season to go bankrupt, we are back to the old grind around here, also known as really doing something with this old house.
We've been at it for 28 years.
Old houses aren't really-done-something-with in a day, a week, a year, unless you've got a lot of money, and then you'd buy a new one anyway.


Q and A
LEAD: New 2d-Home Tax Rules  Question: I own vacation property on the Jersey Shore that has two homes, one I use for myself and the other a rental.
For tax purposes, I proportioned the buildings on a 30-70 percent basis.
On the rental, which is much larger, I take deductions for repairs, interest, taxes, insurance and depreciation.


Bucks Sign Lucas
LEAD: JOHN LUCAS, twice waived from the N.B.A. for cocaine use, returned to basketball yesterday when he signed to play the remainder of the season with the Milwaukee Bucks.

AFGHAN GUERILLAS VOW TO STEP UP THEIR WAR
LEAD: Cheered on by tens of thousands of people shouting ''Death to the Russians!'' Afghan guerrilla leaders at a rally here today vowed to step up their war against the Afghan authorities in Kabul and said they would try to form their own government in exile.


The Cult Of Ceausescu
LEAD: David Binder's article shows only the darker side of the President of Rumania.
Mr.
Binder reports that he had to submit his questions ahead of time when he requested an interview with Mr.
Ceausescu.
Is it not the same when you request an interview with a United States President?
And what about protocol?


THE WORLD'S WORST CRITICS
LEAD: SELF-CRITICISM is an art not many are qualified to practice.
Despite our best efforts it is probable that, apart from the most immediate, pragmatic, technical revisions, the writer's effort to detach himself from his work is quixotic: knowing too much is a way of knowing too little; or, conversely, how can we expect to know more about ourselves than we know about anything else?


WHEN VIBRATO IS ON SHAKY GROUND
LEAD: That was a fascinating story in this newspaper the other day about the retarded child who, without musical training, could sit down at a piano, reproduce a melody and immediately improvise four-part harmony to it.
Such ''idiots savant,'' as the French call these mysteriously gifted persons, turn up in music now and then, to the astonishment of us all.


NEW MEXICANS SEEKING HEALTH THROUGH THINNESS
LEAD: New Mexicans are trying to shed as much as 200,000 pounds by the end of March as part of the nation's first statewide campaign to reduce heart disease through health education.


Cable TV
LEAD: There's good home viewing in some of the week's newer film fare, like Bravo's ''Bring On the Night'' (1985), a rock feature with Sting and his new group, done with originality and skill - Sunday at 8 P.M. and 2 A.M.; and the station's ''Camila'' (1984), a passionate, beautifully played and fact-based costume drama about the love of an aristocrat and a priest in Argentina - Monday at 8 P.M.


OFFICIAL BELIEVES SMALL PLANE FLEW INTO FLIGHT PATH
LEAD: A small private plane apparently flew into the path of a larger commuter aircraft before the two collided over this Salt Lake City suburb Thursday, killing all 10 people aboard the planes, a Federal safety official said Friday night.

John.
Lightning Video. 1986. 60 minutes. $29.95.


President Reagan Seems Trapped in a Tangled, Paradoxical Web
LEAD: PRESIDENT REAGAN appears to be trapped in a web of paradox over the secret sale of arms to Iran, vulnerable if he knew more about the deal than he has acknowledged and vulnerable if he knew less about it than his critics insist any President should have known.


WHEN STUDENTS ALSO HOLD JOBS
LEAD: THOSE who track the efforts of the United States Department of Education to stem the ''rising tide of mediocrity'' characterizing American education may know that, under the department's aegis, a new report (completed by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching) has just been released.


SCIENCE FICTION
LEAD: THE FOLK OF THE AIR (Del Rey/Ballantine, $16.95) by Peter S. Beagle, a fantasy novel set in contemporary California, mixes science and the supernatural so seamlessly that the bedazzled reader soon ceases to care which is which.
Certainly none of the characters in this book stay up nights worrying about such distinctions.


EPIC BATTLES IN THE WAR BETWEEN IRAN AND IRAQ
LEAD: Iran and Iraq agree that their battles of the last 10 days have been epic, even by the grisly standards of their seven-year war.
But in what has become a ritual, both countries claimed victory last week and issued grandiose assertions.


'HUMAN ISSUES' IN WRECK INQUIRY
LEAD: As officials said the investigation of Amtrak's worst accident was focusing on ''human performance issues,'' the National Transportation Safety Board recommended the wider use of technology that takes over if a human lapses.


Jonathan R. Eiseman Weds Miss Seigerman
LEAD: The marriage of Robin Judith Seigerman, a third-year law student at New York University, and Jonathan Richard Eiseman, a lawyer in the real estate department of the New York law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, took place last evening at the Mamaroneck (N.Y.) Beach and Yacht Club.
Rabbi Isaac Swift officiated.


MAFIA BOSSES ARE SENTENCED TO CENTURIES
LEAD: Seven of the eight men convicted in November of operating or helping operate a New York-based Mafia ''commission'' were sentenced last week to jail terms of 100 years; the eighth received 40 years.
Included among the seven were three men convicted as bosses of major crime families: Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno, 75 years old, of the Genovese family; Anthony (Tony Ducks) Corallo, 73, of the Lucchese family, and Carmine (Junior) Persico, 53, of the Colombo group.


Shopping Malls
LEAD: To the Editor:  Shopping malls are of interest to sociologists for reasons other than esthetics and traffic patterns. ''Why Everyone Goes to the Mall'' (Dec. 21) refers to malls as the new town squares and as rigidly programmed selling machines, without ever pondering the implications of this conjunction.


SOVIET REPORTS ECONOMIC UPTURN
LEAD: The year-end Soviet economic report, made public today, showed a positive trend, but said serious deficiencies remained.


ALASKA
LEAD: To the Editor: What an accurate description of the ferry ride to Alaska!
My husband and I did the seven-day Inside Passage trip on the Matanuska this past September.
And we, too, had only 200 people aboard and found the food and accommodations just fine.
But it was the scenery that made the voyage memorable.


WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING
LEAD: The Republican Party is expected to decide in the coming week to hold its 1988 Presidential nominating convention in New Orleans.
The choice signals the importance of the South as a battleground in the next contest for the White House; only rarely has the Republican Party ventured below the Mason-Dixon line for its quadrennial celebration.


Diane Schwebel, Perry Freedman, Lawyers, Marry
LEAD: Diane Schwebel, an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, and Perry Dean Freedman, a lawyer in private practice in New York, were married yesterday at the Old Oaks Country Club in Purchase, N.Y.
Rabbi Amiel Wohl performed the ceremony.


Indian Land Claims Rejected
LEAD: Land claims by descendants of the Sioux Indians have been rejected by a Federal appeals court in a case lawyers said might affect similar claims to about 1.5 million acres nationwide.


BEQUEST FOR THE HUNGRY
LEAD: Marlene Manes, whose husband, Donald, left a rather large estate for a public employee, has agreed to share her inheritance with the city's elderly and sick, municipal officials announced last week.
Mr.
Manes, the Queens Borough President who committed suicide last year after being implicated in the municipal corruption scandal, left an estate of slightly more than $1 million, as much as $300,000 of which, investigators charged, came from bribes.


BLAZING A NEW TRAIL IN WILDS OF NASSAU
LEAD: A SECOND greenbelt trail across Long Island has been mapped and blazed for 22 miles from Massapequa to Cold Spring Harbor.
It passes through parks and preserves and rights of way acquired for a railroad and road that were never built, offering an intimate look at not only the Island's nature but also its historic roots.


PROSPECTS
LEAD: Dollar Diplomacy


CALIFORNIA FACES A SPENDING FIGHT
LEAD: George Deukmejian, a Republican, has begun his second term in office as he began the first one: fighting over money with Democratic legislators and the state's influential public schools lobby.


Escape Route as Design Element
LEAD: IT did not take the New Year's Eve inferno at the Dupont Plaza Hotel in San Juan to focus Alfred Menziuso's attention on the subject of designing safe means of escape from burning high-rise buildings.


QUESTIONS ON NEW DUNNE POST
LEAD: THE appointment recently of State Senator John R. Dunne, a Garden City Republican, as deputy majority leader of the State Senate is a step forward in his career.
But the significance of his new post for Long Island was less than clear.

CARNIVAL
LEAD: To the Editor: To get wet feet in Venice, it is not necessary to visit during the Carnival period.
My wife and I arrived in the Queen of the Adriatic on the heels of a huge low-pressure area that had bounced our plane around en route from Milan in September 1968.
That evening we went from the Hotel Metropole to Piazza San Marco to hear the municipal band, which was playing selections from ''Norma'' and ''Tannhauser.


REDMEN DOMINATE U CONN
LEAD: St.
John's may not be back in the same groove that allowed it to win its first nine games this season.
But after two straight losses and a couple of mediocre victories, the Redmen have apparently moved into a higher gear.


DRINKING LAW: MASSACHUSETTS DEBATE
LEAD: A tougher drunken driving law, approved by the State Legislature last year just in time for Christmas and New Year's Eve, has set off a heated debate here about civil liberties and public safety.


CRIME
LEAD: Two cult writers of mystery fiction have published new books featuring series characters -and both live up to their reputation.
Joseph Hansen's latest book is THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED (Holt, $15.95), and Tony Hillerman's is SKINWALKERS (Harper &amp; Row, $15.95).
They are cult figures because they write well, have staked out an area of their own and have attracted a discriminating and faithful audience.


AN OLD FAVORITE IS BACK IN TOWN
LEAD: ACCESSORIES of alligator and crocodile skin have long been chic.
But since laws were passed to protect those reptiles, such adornments have not been as visible as they were a couple of decades ago, when they added a special touch to many a smart woman's attire.
Now, however, handbags and belts made from the skins are back and despite their price tag - bags start at around $800 and can run into the thousands - customers have been lin ing up to buy them.


Foundation Dug for Long-Delayed Queens Project
LEAD: AFTER seven years of delays, backhoes are finally scratching a foundation into the frozen ground at Queens Boulevard and Union Turnpike in Kew Gardens, Queens.
But Sidney Esikoff, the developer, still is not certain exactly what he can build there.


Langer Holds One-Shot Lead
LEAD: Bernhard Langer returned to a conventional golf course today but turned in a rather unconventional round to barely hold on to his lead through four rounds of the 28th annual Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.


Raiders Of the Sacred Sites
LEAD: The American Indian had no word for art and believed that a beautifully made object was ''a prayer made visible.'' Avarice, ignorance and indifference are allowing the destruction of our most profound cultural heritage.
J.
REZENDES  New York City


THE SEASON OF AMBIVALENCE
LEAD: IT'S back again - the season of my discontent, and of my content.
The season I hate, the season I love.
Winter.


Master Of the Sentimental Sell
LEAD: We need to take a long hard look at the people who concoct ''warm-hearted, gentle, spirited and emotion-laden commercials'' selling junk food, junk beer, junk wine and junk presidents, and, thereby, take a desperately needed look at ourselves and our very foolish buying habits.
GEORGE WINSHIP


Slim Pickings Elsewhere
LEAD: Outside the financial stocks, definitions of ''undervalued'' must be stretched for many names to surface.
One money manager scanned his entire list for a cheap stock before coming back with a verbal shrug, ''None.'' The rare companies with low P/E multiples or large discounts from book value generally have problems that discourage analysts from recommending them.

New York: Harper &amp; Row. $22.95.

David St.
George performed the ceremony at St.
Peter's Episcopal Church.


'STATE OF THE STATE' MESSAGE OPENS DOOR TO DEBATE
LEAD: GOVERNOR KEAN delivered what he called an ''opportunity agenda'' to the Legislature last week, and one of the opportunities will be for heightened debate over his program in the coming months.


Dance
LEAD: French dance is enjoying a renaissance.
And the venerable Paris Opera Ballet is not the only important French choreographic center today.
The enterprising Lyon Opera Ballet opens Tuesday at the City Center with Maguy Marin's ''Cinderella,'' which promises to be like no other version of the fairy tale.


TWO ORCHESTRAS REACH MIDPOINT OF THE SEASON
LEAD: THE pace of the concert season quickens somewhat next weekend, with two of the county's fine orchestras leading the way.


The Historical Jesus
LEAD: To the Editor:


A CHILI WINTER
LEAD: ON A RECENT EXPEDITION in Sonoma County, Calif., my hunting partner, Bob Cooley of California's Hacienda Winery, and I netted a wild boar.


THE REGION
LEAD: A sense of deja vu accompanied the unfolding of New York City's corruption scandals last week, but the news was all new.
Stanley M. Friedman, the former Bronx Democratic leader, was indicted on fresh charges in connection with Citisource, the computer company that figured prominently in his conviction on racketeering charges in November; Richard L.


MILK REGULATIONS ARE A HOT POTATO
LEAD: JUDGING by the grateful praise it elicited from consumer groups and local politicians, a Federal court ruling 10 days ago allowing more competition in New York City's milk markets verged on divine deliverance.


CHURCHES CONSIDER NEW SITES
LEAD: Committees of two major Protestant denominations Friday recommended new headquarters sites, both in Missouri: St.
Louis for the United Church of Christ and Kansas City for the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).


Freshman attitudes
LEAD: American college freshmen are more interested in financial success according to a new survey by the University of California at Los Angeles and the American Council on Education, and less interested than their predecessors in helping others.
The study, based on responses from 204,491 students who entered college last fall, also reported less support for the preservation of the environment and a significant drop in support for the legalization of marijuana.


THE SUPERPOWERS' ROLE
LEAD: Did the United States deliberately distort the intelligence reports it delivered to Iran and Iraq in an effort to prolong their war?
According to intelligence sources in Washington, American officials, among other things, gave Teheran information that exaggerated the number of Soviet troops on its border and altered satellite photographs that were shared with


TRYING TO SHIELD INJURED AMERICAN INDUSTRIES
LEAD: WHILE preaching free trade, the Reagan Administration has made protectionist concessions to a number of powerful domestic industries, from steel and lumber to semiconductors.
But its piecemeal approach, aimed at slaking demand for trade restraints, might instead have increased it.


128 Are Arrested in Protest Of Trident Missile Launching
LEAD: More than 100 protesters, including Dr.
Benjamin Spock, the pediatrician, were arrested today when they scrambled over a fence at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station as thousands of demonstrators protested the test launching Thursday of a Trident 2 missile.


Fuming
LEAD: To the Editor:  After reading ''Nobody Is Safe If a Smoker Is Around,'' by Charles Lemaistre, and ''A Propaganda War Against Cigarettes,'' by Scott Edward Stapf (Forum, Jan. 4), I fear that the debate over ''passive'' smoking has become too clinical - it loses sight of the problem in a muddle of facts and studies.


'BRIGHTON BEACH' AT THE PAPER MILL
LEAD: YEARS from now - maybe next year, even - audiences who go in for marathons may get the chance to see the Neil Simon autobiographical trilogy ''Brighton Beach Memoirs,'' ''Biloxi Blues'' and ''Broadway Bound'' in one ''Nicholas Nickelby''-like day's journey into real enlightenment.


Seeking Truth in Baseball
LEAD: THIS was going to be a joyous midwinter review of the videotapes of the Mets' World Series victory, a last chance to revel in the glories of baseball before Super Bowl mania hits us like a ton of Twinkies.


IN KANSAS CITY, TO BE NUDE IS LEWD
LEAD: Controversy, a columnist here warned the other day, is threatening to ''rend the fabric'' of Kansas City civility and ''divide the citizenry.''


Wedding Planned By Miss Hamlin, Officer of a Bank
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Helene M. Hamlin of Haddonfield, N.J., of the engagement of her daughter Dianne Marie Hamlin to William Kent Haydock Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs.
W.
Kent Haydock of Darien, Conn.
A June wedding is planned.


HERO AND GOAT
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


WHEN SALT MUST BE RESTRICTED, THERE ARE TASTY ALTERNATIVES
LEAD: SOME seasonings are roughly interchangeable.
Tarragon can stand in for chervil and, in a pinch so can parsley.
Vinegar instead of lemon is another effective substitution as is black pepper for cayenne.
But no seasoning does exactly the same job of bringing up flavor as salt.
When a diet requires salt to be restricted it becomes a challenge for the cook.


Alaska
LEAD: To the Editor: ''Through Alaska On Your Own'' by Virginia Van der Veer Hamilton (Travel, Dec. 21) reminded me of a favorite part of my own independent trip through the Canadian Rockies and Alaska last summer.
We took a local train from Anchorage to Denali National Park and saw a rich variety of people and scenes: professional couples heading for their weekend cabins, retired railroad workers debarking at their front doors, a horde of people netting king salmon in a stream, a load-carrying huskie and its owner, mail tossed out the window at specific locations and an anxious-looking man from


A PASSION FOR WHEELS, WINGS AND ENGINES
LEAD: The photographs of Jacques-Henri Lartigue, who died last summer at the age of 92, are art photography's best-known version of primitivism.
Most were taken in the early years of this century, when Lartigue was a boy, and they have the freshness and spontaneity of an eye unjaundiced by the conventions of the photography of the day.


Honors and Merit
LEAD: Sentiment counts for little when the Federal budget ax is swinging but power is still power.
That's quite evident in two scholarly footnotes to President Reagan's plan for fiscal 1988.


JUDGE DELAYS CALIFORNIA MURDER TRIAL
LEAD: The judge in a murder trial, angered that the police seized documents in the home of the chief defendant while jury selection was under way, has put off the trial to determine if the case involving members of the Billionaire Boys Club has been tainted.


NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD: Beans for the Critic Just as some Americans try to go through Europe on $5 a day, a character in Bernard Malamud's ''Last Mohican'' rations his perceptions in Rome.
This is one of many stories in ''The Art of the Tale'' (Elisabeth Sifton/Viking), edited by Daniel Halpern.


ON LANGUAGE
LEAD: IT BEGAN IN A NEW YORK minute after a piece about geographical derogations, the use of place names as modifiers to sneer at a trait or an occupation.
My colleague Russell Baker passed along a cryptic message - ''Larchmont lockjaw'' - which I took to mean the pronunciation affected by yuppies.
I then passed it along to the Philadelphia lawyers who read this column as the speech affected by ''upper-class lowerclassmen returning to suburbia.


MT. VERNON TOXIC CLEANUP: A NEIGHBORHOOD DISRUPTED
LEAD: FEDERAL environmental experts clearing a warehouse containing potentially explosive chemicals at the southern edge of this city indicated last week that their worst fears might not be realized and that they could probably thank the owners, now serving 13-year prison terms, for the progress.


The Intimate Churchill
LEAD: To the Editor:


SIGNS OF VIOLENCE ARISE IN MEAT PLANT'S LOCKOUT
LEAD: Hardly anyone here was surprised the other day when two puppies were found killed, one bludgeoned, one poisoned.
It was widely believed that the motivation was a grudge against the town's biggest employer, Iowa Beef.


INSIDE
LEAD: Building to a Super Bowl
How the Giants and Broncos built the teams that reached pro football's title game: First of a series on the Giants in the Super Bowl, Section 5.
'Frost Factor' in Britain
Britain's long freeze has started a debate on whether Margaret Thatcher's Government has been doing enough to fight the cold's effects.


ENHANCING BLACK SKIN
LEAD: WITH BLACK MODELS among the stars of the fashion industry, and with the proliferation of skin-care and makeup lines for black consumers, the 1960's slogan ''black is beautiful'' is finally reaching commercial fulfillment.
As Susan L. Taylor, the editor in chief of Essence magazine, explains: ''Black skin is such an incredible canvas.


STRANDED BY POLITICS AND WAR: NICARAGUA'S LOVED, NEGLECTED POET
LEAD: ONE can hardly imagine how remote the newborn republic of Nicaragua must have been from the world's cosmopolitan centers during the last century.
It was perceived, not quite correctly, as a tropical backwater, steamy, inert and destitute of learning and culture.
Yet from a wretched Nicaraguan village, by some amazing mystery, emerged Ruben Dario, the vagabond poet who was to influence Latin American and Spanish literature forever and dazzle Europe as no provincial ever had.


ARE BASEBALL PLAYERS ASKING TOO MUCH?
LEAD: Yes, baseball players are paid too much money.
These players should put some money away so they don't have to be so greedy.


Ms. Cowles Engaged
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Peter F. Cowles of Westfield, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Jacqueline Ann Cowles, to Mark D. Resnick, the son of Paula Menard of Cranston, R.I.
A June wedding is planned.
Ms.
Cowles, who is known as Jackie, and her fiance graduated from the University of Rhode Island.


City as Landlord
LEAD: To the Editor:  Your article headed ''New York Plays Reluctant Landlord'' on Dec. 14 misses one very important point: Many of these buildings coming under city control were previously rent-controlled or -stabilized.
The consequent severe restrictions on rent increases caused the buildings to be unprofitable, and therefore neglected, and finally abandoned by their owners.


'CALMER WATERS' FOR NEW YORK CITY'S FINANCES
LEAD: Just two months ago, it seemed that New York City would have to start sailing closer to the wind.
Mayor Koch projected a $623 million deficit for the fiscal year beginning July 1 and warned that services might have to be cut.


MEMORY IS HER WORK
LEAD: BREAKING BREAD By Joyce Reiser Kornblatt. 206 pp.
New York: A William Abrahams Book/ E. P. Dutton. $16.95.


SHAW'S PLAYS GO ON TALKING TO MODERN AUDIENCES
LEAD: George Bernard Shaw's contemporaries would have been astonished to know that his plays were still being performed around the world toward the end of the 20th century (''You Never Can Tell'' is now winding up a revival in New York).
A playwright was the last thing they considered him to be.
If theater reviewers agreed on nothing else, they were certain that he could not write for the stage.


CONNER'S CREW SAILS TO 3-1 LEAD
LEAD: The boat with a racing record so exemplary that she has acquired the nickname Kiwi Magic sailed in the America's Cup challenge finals today as if someone had cut a hole in her bag of tricks.

LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


PAN AM'S DISAPPEARING ACT

CONCERT: MUSICKE CONSORT
LEAD: THE Consort of Musicke's Wednesday night concert at Weill Recital Hall, devoted to English and Italian music of the 17th century, provided an ample impression of the group and its charms even to this listener who was pushed into an early departure by the flu.

SCIENTISTS SEEK TO FOMENT GREEN REVOLUTION IN AFRICA
LEAD: AGAINST the bleak landscape of African agriculture, a hundred scientists from 44 countries are working on the technologies they hope will someday lead to the long-sought Green Revolution.


BRADLEY OUTPACES ITS PLAN FOR GROWTH
LEAD: IN 1982, when the state announced plans for a $100 million upgrading of Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, it was expected that the improvements would carry the airport through the late 1990's.


Sheila Harrington Bride of Lieut. Paul J. Sweeney
LEAD: Sheila Harrington, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Patrick J. Harrington of the Bronx and High Falls, N.Y., and Lieut.
Paul J. Sweeney, U.S.M.C.R., were married yesterday.
The bridegroom is a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward F. Sweeney Jr. of Garden City, L.I., and Monroe, N.Y.
The Rev.
Sabas Kilian performed the ceremony at St.


CLARINET: GERVASE DE PEYER
LEAD: WEDNESDAY night's curious collection of clarinet pieces at Merkin Concert Hall had a common denominator - their personal associations with the featured performer, Gervase de Peyer.
Mr. de Peyer arranged the sonatas by Handel and Schubert and has given the premieres of all the other items on this program except one.


New Talent Bolsters 15-0 Syracuse
LEAD: IT is 9 o'clock at night and Jim Boeheim, the basketball coach at Syracuse University, is relaxing in the recreation room of his split-level house.


RECALLING THE DAYS OF 'WE SHALL OVERCOME'
LEAD: Chapters of American history most regretted by Americans have sometimes been those for which people in the rest of the world have most admired the United States.
Watergate comes to mind.
What many in the international community remember most about Watergate is not the criminality of a President but the effective working of the civil machinery that removed him from office - the way in which the will of the people truly prevailed.


LEFTISTS IN MEXICO SEEKING A MERGER
LEAD: Mexico's political left, traditionally divided, is trying to unite into a single party that could present a greater challenge to the governing party.


NAMING BABY FOR HISTORY'S SAKE
LEAD: Linda Liefland's essay on ''Finding a Surname for Baby''  [ Dec. 28 ]  reminded me of my childhood in Hungary where many of us came from mixed marriages, the mothers being Catholic and the fathers Protestant.
For most of us the egalitarian division fell so that the girls went to the Catholic church and the boys to the Protestant church, which made us believe that the niceties, colors and elaborate decorations in our church were meant for women while the men went to more down-to-earth and masculine houses of worship.


CASTING LIGHT ON THE USE OF FLASH
LEAD: FOR some photographers, night football games are enormously funny.
Not that the game itself is all that amusing; it's the sight of thousands of fans in the stadium firing off thousands of electronic flash units.
Too bad for the fans that such bursts of light are ineffectual.

A JOB CRUNCH JOLTS JAPAN
LEAD: HIDEAKI NARA, 38 years old and out of work, sat in the unemployment office of this northern industrial city and stared at a card describing a job at a textile factory.

LEAD: Thanks to Hal Riney for his Norman Rockwell approach to advertising.
In a world as harsh and complex as ours is, his sentimental approach is refreshing!
MANDY VICTOR  Fairfield, Conn.


LET NATURE TAKE CARE OF SWANS
LEAD: I take issue with the methods proposed to control swans reported in the article on swan control  [ ''Controls on Swans Proposed,'' Jan. 4 ] .
I get the feeling that Nobel Proctor, albeit a professor of ornithology, truly hates swans.
I 've read other articles in which he maligns swans.


Of Military Garbage and Military Glory
LEAD: Gen.
Maxwell R. Thurman underscores his place as the No. 2 officer in the Army by telling friends, ''I'm Avis, not Hertz.'' Adm.

CAVALIERS BEAT KNICKS, 116-110

Venetian Lace
LEAD: To the Editor: I read with much interest Anne Marshall Zwack's article ''Splendor of a Fading Art'' (Travel, Dec. 14).
The descriptions of Jesurum's museum and shop brought back wonderful memories.
In October 1980 while on vacation in Italy, I visited Jesurum with a specific task in mind.
My oldest daughter was to be married the following August and was going to wear my wedding gown, which was then 30 years old.

Art
LEAD: At a moment of considerable interest in the possibilities of abstraction, the Luise Ross Gallery, 50 West 57th Street, has brought together four little known artists whose work defines, each in its own way, an edge between abstraction and figuration.
The diptychs of Cynthia Gallagher and the vertical slabs of George Hildrew are paintings with precise figurative and sculptural associations.


RURAL AREAS BECOME DEBRIS SITES IN WAKE OF DUMP CLOSING
LEAD: SINCE the closing of the Croton landfill last summer many towns have discontinued or limited pickup of bulk trash.
Commercial carters, the alternative to municipal pickup, refuse to remove a lone discarded sofa or refrigerator, while the larger loads that they agree to remove are likely to cost homeowners more than four times as much as a year ago.


In a Hot Market, the Bargains Evaporate
LEAD: WITH the stock market flying on afterburners, analysts are hard-pressed to find stocks that look undervalued by such traditional measures as price-earnings ratio and book value.
Indeed, among many analysts surveyed, few could come up with a classic value play.
John Johnson, of Johnson, Valliant &amp; Broadfoot, noted that the entire ''emerging growth'' sector - generally smaller companies with fast earnings gains -looked undervalued from one perspective: the average price-earnings ratio about matches the overall market's; in 1983, smaller growth companies commanded twice the market's P/E ratio.


CO-OP HUNTING IN THE OUTER BOROUGHS
LEAD: WHEN Bill Dillard was not on the road, singing and acting in musicals or playing his trumpet with Louis Armstrong, he lived in rental apartments in Harlem.

HAYES SAYS PHILS ARE SET TO CHALLENGE

ARE BASEBALL PLAYERS ASKING TOO MUCH?
LEAD: Ye$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$@  MICHAEL SMOLENS  Great Neck, L.I.


WHEN SALT MUST BE RESTRICTED, THERE ARE TASTY ALTERNATIVES
LEAD: SOME seasonings are roughly interchangeable.
Tarragon can stand in for chervil and, in a pinch so can parsley.
Vinegar instead of lemon is another effective substitution as is black pepper for cayenne.
But no seasoning does exactly the same job of bringing up flavor as salt.
When a diet requires salt to be restricted it becomes a challenge for the cook.


All in One's Stride
LEAD: To walk with a spring in one's stride is no longer a mere phrase.
Scientists at Leeds in England have measured the springiness in the arch of the human foot.
Running, in their analysis, is a matter not of sweat and endurance but of storing and expending energy between strides - ''like a rubber ball bouncing along.

ENCOURAGING 'DREAMERS' WITH GRANTS
LEAD: ON May 16, Dr.

Learning On the Job
LEAD: Cheers to A. M. Rosenthal.
Nobody has ever made a better case for how much a free press means to a free people.
And he did it in prose as spare and lean as a good police reporter's account of a murder.
If eternal vigilance really is the price of liberty, then America has been lucky these last 40 years to have had a bowman like old Four Eyes on the battlements.


OFFICIALS CITE 27 FOOD OUTLETS
LEAD: The New York City Department of Health last week released a list of 27 food establishments cited for violating the health code.


JAZZ: SPHERE, AT VANGUARD

HU'S OUSTER RAISES TROUBLESOME QUESTIONS

WHAT'S DOING IN CRANS-MONTANA
LEAD: The Crans-Montana plateau in Switzerland was once scorned by local peasants as fit for little more than cow grazing; 60 years ago it was a destination for tuberculosis patients seeking crisp, dry air.
Since then, skiers and golfers seeking the same weather conditions for winter and summer sports have come to predominate the 5,000-foot-high resort community.


TALE OF MYSTICISM ENDS UP MYSTIFYING
LEAD: We can all rejoice, presumably, that Shirley MacLaine went to Peru and found inner peace.
Unfortunately, however, ABC-TV has given her five hours of prime time to tell us all about it - in minute detail.
For those of us who remain skeptical, at best, about reincarnation, extraterrestrials, out-of-body trippers and trance channelers, ''Out on a

COLD WEATHER TESTS RESOLVE OF BRITISH ISLES
LEAD: The celebrated British stiff upper lip has been tested for the last week by the European cold spell and found quivering.


BESS MYERSON STEPS ASIDE
LEAD: Her former campaign manager, David Garth, described Bess Myerson as a fighter, ''not the sort of person who pulls the bedspread over her head.'' But last week the city's Cultural Affairs Commissioner quietly began a leave of absence pending an inquiry into issues stemming from a Federal grand jury investigation of a contractor who has been her regular companion for several years.


Murdoch Wins an Autralian Dust-Up
LEAD: Rupert Murdoch came out on top of the battle of the media titans in Australia.
In a deal struck with his rival, Robert Holmes a Court, Mr.
Murdoch cleared the way to take control of the Herald and Weekly, Australia's largest media group.
In turn, Mr.
Holmes a Court, who agreed to withdraw his $1.4 billion bid, is to purchase the group's two Perth newspapers and its Melbourne television stations, which many analysts said were what he really wanted.

Fuming

FEELING ISOLATED ON THE ISLAND
LEAD: Wendy Turgeon's ''Won't Anybody Here Talk to Me?'' (Opinion Page, Dec. 14), painfully refers to the isolation many of us can feel here on Long Island.

Give Foreign Borrowers a Break
LEAD: IF 1982 marked the emergence of the international debt crisis, 1987 could the year the notion of debt relief becomes respectable.
Developing countries in Latin America and Africa, whose outstanding debt totals an estimated $973 billion, have been rumbling about relief for at least two years.
Stringent adjustment programs, they say, which buy them payment extensions from creditors, also sap their economies and threaten their political stability.


LIVING BY THE BOOK IN RETIREMENT
LEAD: YOU CAN always tell a new resident of an adult condominium community from the other gray-haired types because one shoulder is always lower than the other.
This comes from carrying the prospectus around from condo meeting to condo meeting.
What is this prospectus?
It is the thick, telephone directory-size book of rules and regulations for living in a condominium, the thing that all condo real-estate ads clearly state you can't buy one of their homes or apartments without.


UNSINKABLE SOUTH AFRICA
LEAD: It's not hard to figure why South Africa's white rulers are excluding foreign journalists, like reporters for The Times, and stifling what was once the freest press in Africa.
President P. W. Botha wants fewer television pictures and better newspaper headlines.
He wants his National Party to overwhelm all opponents in the election looming this spring.


About Men; The Comfort of Pals
LEAD: RECENTLY, WHILE I WAS CON-valescing from an operation, Bert and Buddy, two old friends whom I rarely see because they live far away, visited me.

LEAD: To the Editor: We were most interested to read Bernard Holland's recent account of the music-publishing industry and pleased by the attention he devoted to the new management of G. Schirmer  [ ''For Music Publishing, Technology Means Hard Times,'' Dec. 7 ] .
Still, there were a number of inaccuracies in the account that we wish to point out.

Master Of the Sentimental Sell
LEAD: During the 1984 Presidential campaign, I suddenly noted that, from the preambles, I couldn't differentiate between commercials extolling the virtues of the President and those promoting raisin bread (''Master of the Sentimental Sell,'' by Art Kleiner, Dec. 14).
Distressed, I monitored other facets of my cognitive processes and was comforted to find no other evidence of deterioration.

Toting Up Americans' Scores in Math
LEAD: SOUNDING disappointed but not surprised, educators met in Washington last week to confront the news that in mathematics American pupils score dismally, compared to those in other industrialized countries.
The symposium was sponsored by the National Research Council's Mathematical Sciences Education Board, which had issued three comparative studies pointing to serious shortcomings in American elementary and secondary schools.

Guess Who's Grinning
LEAD: LAST year I wrote for this page about how I hated the Chicago Bears, and had hated them since I was a kid growing up in Wisconsin hard by the shores of Lake Michigan some 60 miles north of Chicago.
Being then a youngster with visions of becoming another Don Hutson, I took every Bear victory over my Green Bay Packers very personally.


Q&amp;A
LEAD: Multiple Visas Question:I am planning a lengthy trip to 10 or 12 Asian countries.
Is there a company that will obtain all necessary visas for me?
What will it cost, how much time is needed and how precisely must one predict the dates for visiting a country? - R. B., Wickliffe, Ohio Answer:Several companies in New York - where most countries have consulates - specialize in obtaining visas, and there are similar services in Washington, on the West Coast and some other cities.


IRE AROUND THE NEW YORKER
LEAD: Writers and editors at the The New Yorker may have become so accustomed to their literary freedom that they confused it with democracy.
Last week, surprised by the announcement that William Shawn would retire as editor of the magazine in March and be replaced by Robert A. Gottlieb, president and editor in chief of Alfred


LIFE'S BEST THINGS ARE PRICELESS
LEAD: ONCE upon a time, when I still believed that mothers had the duty and power to grant wishes, I promised my last child, then an 11-year-old girl who dreamed of owning a horse, that if we ever moved away I would buy her one.
It was an easy promise, one I thought I would never have to keep.
Friends who passed down to her their own daughters' castoff velvet riding caps, hoof-pickers, horsefly spray and crops assured me that Kate, too, would automatically trot out of the horsey stage when she was 13 or so.

CHILD SUPPORT: AN ANXIETY MILL FOR MOTHERS, FATHERS AND THE LAW
LEAD: To the Editor:


ARE BASEBALL PLAYERS ASKING TOO MUCH?
LEAD: I think it's only natural that in a free enterprise system some ''market correction'' develops.
It was the owners who were responsible for the explosion of player salaries in the 1970's; they have now realized the risky economics of continued bidding wars and longterm contracts.
There is no premeditated ''collusion'' here - it's just that they're all thinking and acting the same way.


SUNDAY OBSERVER
LEAD: IN NEW YORK I USED to stay in no-power hotels.
It was awful.
Nobody interviewed me for press or television.


Learning On the Job
LEAD: As a new high-school teacher in New York City, I do what I can to awaken, in each successive brood, love of the principles Mr.

NO LONGER THE SALAD DAYS
LEAD: A YEAR and a half ago, East of Athens, in Port Jefferson, was a gem of a restaurant.
There was wonderful, authentic Greek country food, an appealing dining room and a staff full of pride.
Little touches like a complimentary appetizer and a small portion of fresh fruit between courses were symbols of the restaurant's care, quality and effort.

POSTINGS: New Try in Tarrytown; A Rent Reduction
LEAD: The Christiania office building in Tarrytown, N.Y., was dedicated in 1984 by Crown Prince Harald and Crown Princess Sonja of Norway, but even that royal cachet was not enough to make it profitable.
Now Morris Bailey of Morris Bailey Enterprises in Manhattan's financial district is taking a crack.
He purchased the six-story, 210,000-square-foot building at the end of last year for $35 million from Christiania, a Norwegian insurance company.

LEAD: To the Editor:


IN ANIMATION FOR CHILDREN, THE OLD DAYS WERE BETTER
LEAD: They come from two different worlds: she is a se rene thoroughbred, he's a street-smart scoundrel with radical ideas.
They meet through friends and fall in love, and he does what he can to show her the world. ''Aw, come on, kid, start building some memories,'' he urges.
But she wants a stable and conventional life, while he wants freedom to roam.

LEAD: The armed forces were placed on alert and roadblocks were set up outside Malacanang Palace on Saturday after reports circulated that armed groups were planning a new move to destabilize the Government.


GARDENERS DON'T WITHER WITH WINTER
LEAD: WINTER, when the ground is rock-hard, the meadows covered with snow and the branches on trees turned to icicles, is not the gardener's favorite time of year.
The scenery seems especially bleak in January, yet at the Bartlett Arboretum in Stamford there are plenty of visitors strolling along the paths.


JAZZ: GEORGE SHEARING
LEAD: THE delicate pianism of George Shearing, who combines one of the most feathery touches in jazz with an English-parlor gentility, has an almost sleight-of-hand quality in club performance.
Especially when Mr.
Shearing calmly wings his way through a series of interlocking blues progressions, the music almost seems to emanate from a magical source separate from the pianist's fingers.


CITY FAULTS STATE OFFER TO HELP PLACE BABIES

Foster Elated
LEAD: GREG FOSTER was jubilant, with good reason.
It was one of the rare times in Foster's track career that he had beaten Renaldo Nehemiah in the hurdles.
He was so happy, Foster said afterward, that he didn't notice when Nehemiah tried to congratulate him after Foster's world-indoor record clocking of 7.36 seconds in the 60-meter hurdles Friday night at the Sunkist Invitational meet in Los


SLOWING DOWN, SLIGHTLY, AT 94
LEAD: SOMEONE looking for a man in his 95th year could not be faulted for taking the search to a hospital.
And in the case of Jack Horwitz, the search would bear fruit when it reached the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park.


For Immigrants, a Rough Road
LEAD: FOR years, the prevailing wisdom on how immigrants fare in the labor market has been based on the notion that assimilation is a key, even determining, factor.
Drawing mainly on 1970 Census data, studies concluded that while earnings of new immigrants were lower than those of comparably situated native workers, earnings of immigrants who had been here for more than a decade exceeded those of native workers of the same age, education and so on.

DISSIDENTS IN ECUADOR AIR FORCE SIEZE PRESIDENT
LEAD: Last year, Ecuador locked up Gen.
Frank Vargas Pazzos, an Air Force commander, after he staged two revolts within a week.
The authorities turned aside General Vargas's insistence that he was merely protesting against corruption in the armed forces.
Later the national congress voted to grant the officer amnesty, and he became something of a folk hero.

LEAD: A boat carrying participants in a Roman Catholic festival sank near an island in the central Philippines on Friday, killing at least 50 people, the authorities said today.


KEAN AIMS FOR WELFARE REFORM THAT WORKS
LEAD: IF the Legislature goes along, as expected, New Jersey may soon be the first state in the nation to require every able-bodied welfare recipient, including mothers of young children, to work or attend school.
Governor Kean, announcing the new direction for the state's $1 billion welfare system last week in his State of the State message, called it ''a bold and reasonable plan.


FOR THE RECORD

MURDOCH HOLDINGS ISSUE IN AUSTRALIA
LEAD: The overnight transformation of Rupert Murdoch's Australian newspaper holdings into a national chain with two-thirds of the country's circulation has raised concerns here about the concentration of so many newspapers in the control of one individual.


NETWORKS AND N.F.L. ARE DRAWING THE BATTLE LINES
LEAD: For many years, the three major television networks and the National Football League have formed a partnership that has handsomely benefited everyone involved.
ABC, CBS and NBC paid top price for exclusive rights to the games, filling the coffers of team owners, helping to fund increased player salaries, and, most years, earning millions of dollars in profits for themselves.


GREEKS' PLANS FOR OLYMPIAD ARE IMPERILED
LEAD: The event is nearly a decade away, but the Greek Government may already have lost what it considers a historic right: the ''Golden Olympiad'' of 1996.


SEA MUSEUM SEEKING FUNDS

Fuming
LEAD: To the Editor:  When the Environmental Protection Agency and the Surgeon General join hands to argue that the slightest involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke is worse than anything else, except breathing asbestos, are they playing a political game?

Not even for a diehard.


RELUCTANTLY, JAPAN IS CONTEMPLATING THE PILL
LEAD: MORE than two decades after the birth control pill launched a sexual revolution in the United States, the Japanese Government is close to officially condoning its use.
Instead of praise, however, the move has met with criticism from feminists and wariness from the public, which is not expected to switch en masse to oral contraception.


BETTING WITH THE ODDS
LEAD: The card-playing enthusiasm of the British aristocracy has added more than one word to the English language.
In the 18th century the third Earl of Sandwich, a diplomat and politician of some notoriety nicknamed Jeremy Twitcher, was unwilling to take time out from his game to eat.
He asked the waiter to bring him some meat between two slices of bread and millions now use his name daily.


PREGNANCY LEAVE FOR WOMEN, AND MEN
LEAD: For women serious about both career and family, life can quickly become a difficult balancing act.
A new Supreme Court decision promises to make the balancing a bit easier.
It allows states to guarantee job-protected leave to pregnant workers.

Old Giants Rate The New
LEAD: WHEN the Giants were winning six Eastern Division titles in eight seasons, from 1956 through 1963, their Hall of Fame defensive end, Andy Robustelli, was known as the Pope in the locker room.
To his teammates, the Pope was infallible.
When the Pope spoke, they agreed.
They still do.
When the Pope invited several Giants alumni to a dinner for the National Society for the Prevention of Blindness at ''21'' the other night, they agreed.


Fishing on Thin Ice
LEAD: As the trout and salmon season on inland lakes begins today, officials are warning anglers to beware of thin ice.

Salvador State of Siege to Expire
LEAD: A state of siege that had been in effect almost continuously since 1980 has expired after members of the conservative minority in the National Assembly, who are on strike, refused to act on a bill to renew the restrictions.


WORKERS ARRESTED IN HOTEL ARSON
LEAD: A maintenance worker has admitted setting the fatal fire at the Dupont Plaza Hotel, apparently because he was angry at the management, Federal and Puerto Rican officials said last week.
Hector Escudero Aponte, who had worked at the San Juan hotel for 10 years, was charged with arson and with separate counts of murder for each of the 96 people who died in the New Year's Eve blaze.


WHEN SALT MUST BE RESTRICTED, THERE ARE TASTY ALTERNATIVES
LEAD: SOME seasonings are roughly interchangeable.
Tarragon can stand in for chervil and, in a pinch so can parsley.
Vinegar instead of lemon is another effective substitution as is black pepper for cayenne.
But no seasoning does exactly the same job of bringing up flavor as salt.
When a diet requires salt to be restricted it becomes a challenge for the cook.


MUSIC: FOSS AND 'MODERNS'
LEAD: LUKAS FOSS, that indefatigable champion of contemporary and American music, brought his customary zeal and a widely diversified program to Cooper Union Friday night as part of the Brooklyn Philharmonic's ''Meet the Moderns'' chamber series.

CORRECTION
LEAD: A caption in last Sunday's Westchester Weekly section accompanying an article about a playwriting contest incorrectly identified two of the judges, Ruis Woertendyke and Norman Kline, whose names were transposed.


DIJON'S CASSIS ENJOYS ANOTHER VOGUE
LEAD: Dijon, which is renowned for its mustard, is also the source for cassis, without which the popular aperitif Kir would be an ordinary glass of wine.
Indeed, the drink has given the black currant juice a certain repute not only in France but also in the United States, where wine has become a popular substitute for hard liquor as a cocktail.


GREATS OF CLASSIC JAZZ IGNITE A REISSUE
LEAD: When Orrin Keepnews and Bill Grauer Jr. compiled ''The Riverside History of Classic Jazz'' in 1956, the overview of jazz was much different than it is from the perspective of 30 years later, and the availability of jazz records for reissue was much more restricted.
To encounter this five-disk set today, newly reissued (Riverside B-005) in an exact reproduction of the original boxed album, including the artwork and a warm, colorful, introductory essay by Charles Edward Smith, a pioneer jazz enthusiast and historian (in that order of preference), is both an encounter with a jazz Rip Van

LEAD: A strong earthquake jolted the Pacific coast of northern Japan today, but the police said there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.
The Central Meteorological Agency said the quake, which struck at about 7 P.M., registered a preliminary 5.5 on the open-ended Richter scale.


FOR AIR TRAVEL, 1986 WAS SAFE, BUT JUST BARELY
LEAD: The numbers for 1986 suggest that the nation's airlines are flying closer than ever to disaster, but by some combination of wit and luck are emerging with an improving safety record.


In Big League Sailing, Pressure Is Intense
LEAD: MENTAL pressure could have at least as much to do with winning the America's Cup as secret keels, new sails or subtle differences in hull design.
It is a matter of who breaks first.
Of the four skippers who reached the finals of the challenger and defender selection series, only one - Dennis Conner of Stars and Stripes, has steered in a cup match before.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
LEAD: CABINS AND KINGS ANNIE OAKLEY, Will Rogers, even the Duke of Windsor would have been pleased.

LEAD: The remaining undeveloped segment of one of Garden City's most venerable sites will soon be home to one of Long Island's newest condominium projects.
Construction will start this spring on the Wyndham at Garden City, a $125 million, 316-unit condominium complete with pond, gazebo and health club.
The development will cover the 12.5 acres that form part of the historic 21-acre site of the 100-year-old, Georgian-style Garden City Hotel, which was razed in 1974 and replaced with a new hotel in 1983.


CORRECTIONS
LEAD: A picture caption on Jan. 4 with an article about Kariba, Zimbabwe, misidentified a herd of animals in a field.
The animals were African buffaloes, which are also known as Cape buffaloes.


ISLAND LIVING, ENGLISH STYLE
LEAD: Barbados, the easternmost island of the Caribbean, combines the beauty of a rocky Atlantic shore on the east and sandy Caribbean beaches on the west.
Between lie miles and miles of sugar plantations with winding roads running like narrow corridors through fields of towering sugar cane.
Though Barbados only gained independence from Britain in 1966, the lower house of its Parliament, the House of Assembly, has been active since 1639.


Cold Wave in Russia Alarms Soviet Chiefs
LEAD: Soviet leaders have expressed alarm at the possible harm to the economy by the exceptionally harsh weather that has gripped the Soviet Union since the start of the year.


ARCHIVES OF BUSINESS: THE DOW IN PERSPECTIVE  TRACING THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THE 20th CENTURY THROUGH THE EYES OF WALL STREET; Despite Quirks, the Dow Stands for the Market
LEAD: PERHAPS no animal is possessed of a shorter memory than the bull who lives on Wall Street.
So it seems useful amid the euphoria over the breaching of the 2,000 barrier on the Dow - and the buying spree of last week - to step back and put a historical perspective on the index's recent climb.

LEAD: WHILE a tall, clean-cut boy of 17 galloped around the ring throwing punches in too-rapid succession for his balance, a rugged 16-year-old hit a heavy bag that hung across the room.


Raiders Of the Sacred Sites
LEAD: As a former Bureau of Land Management ranger, I witnessed firsthand the archeological-site destruction in southern Utah and Colorado documented by Derek Goodwin in ''Raiders of the Sacred Sites'' (Dec. 7).
Artifact collectors are professional and elusive; despite back-country patrols and aircraft surveillance, most of my time was spent reburying the remains of Native Americans scattered across the surface of prehistoric sites.


DANCE: KATHRYN POSIN
LEAD: THE Joyce Theater gave a performance Friday night, but the choreographer of honor seemed conspicuously absent.
The program by the Kathryn Posin Dance Company, the closing group in the Joyce Sampler Series, proceeded from one trivial or poorly thought-out dance to another, performed with an understandable lack of conviction.


ARE BASEBALL PLAYERS ASKING TOO MUCH?
LEAD: The debate is always are players asking for too much?
I would like to know how much income the owners derive from the team.
I know how much each player and the managers of the Steinbrenner Yankees and the Wilpon/Doubleday Mets earn, but how much money did George and Fred make in 1986 on their respective teams?


STRIKES ARE GETTING FEWER BUT LONGER
LEAD: WHIPSAWED by automation, increasingly anti-union managements and a large pool of unemployed people willing to break a strike, many union members are finding that ''givebacks'' - cuts in wages and benefits - have become a fact of life.
One result appears to be fewer but longer strikes.
While the rank and file often regarded concessions as onerous from the start, labor leaders strove mightily to put the best face on them, calling them temporary measures to strengthen companies and, above all, protect jobs.


CARLUCCI AND THE N.S.C.
LEAD: LIKE ANYTHING ELSE,'' SAYS Frank Carlucci, ''it can be abused.'' ''It'' is covert action, and Carlucci, who took office two weeks ago as President Reagan's fifth assistant for national security, knows what he is talking about.
His immediate predecessor, Vice Adm.
John M. Poindexter, resigned last

Cloth, $24.50.
Paper, $9.75.


SHULTZ VISITS AFRICA WITH GIFTS AND EXHORTATIONS
LEAD: GIVING foreign aid is the process of doing good for somebody else in pursuit of your own self-interest.
That seemed to be the governing proposition of Secretary of State George P. Shultz's 14,889-mile trip, concluded last week, to six countries in Africa.
As he arrived at one airport or presidential palace after another, often to the accompaniment of drums and dancers brought out in his honor, Mr.


DEFINITELY NOT FOR CLARK KENT
LEAD: THEY stand like sentinels at the southwest corner of Third Avenue and 60th Street - a trio of sleek, smoothly curved black towers with only white back-lighted symbols of a telephone receiver hinting at their purpose.


SURPLUS SCHOOLS: THE DEBATE CONTINUES
LEAD: To anyone unfamiliar with the ongoing controversy over the disposition of two surplus schools in District 14 (Hewlett-Woodmere), Dr.
Bert Nelson's letter to the editor (Dec. 28) in response to an article by Saul Schindler, ''Let's Save Our 'Surplus' Schools'' (Opinion Page, Dec. 7), would appear to be a model of clarity.


TALKING: Insurance; Covering Mortgage Payments
LEAD: WHEN a borrower takes out a mortgage loan, the lender customarily offers insurance to cover payment of the outstanding balance in the event of the borrower's death or disability.


Exemption From Rent Regulations
LEAD: To the Editor:  A question was raised in your Q. &amp; A. column on Nov. 16 about creating exempt status on rent-regulated apartments.
The answer stated: ''The only way to rid a building of its rent-regulated status is through a gut-rehabilitation includingnew ceilings, floors, walls, etc.''


EUROPE'S INNOVATIVE RADIO ORCHESTRAS
LEAD: When the BBC Symphony Orchestra made its first tour in 1936, it took along Schoenberg's Orchestral Variations, Op. 31, and played it in the composer's native city of Vienna.
The work caused total mystification for an audience used to Mozart and Schubert, and when the conductor, Adrian Boult, was introduced to the Austrian President after the performance, the President asked, ''Who is this Schoenberg anyway?

Letters should include the writer's name, address and telephone number.
We regret that because of the large volume of mail received, we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters.


PRESERVING AMERICA'S PAST
LEAD: Scarcely a major city in the United States has not been touched, or even transformed, by preservation.
From coast to coast, the impulse to save old buildings - from the gabled house on Main Street, to the Beaux-Arts railroad terminal - has helped to preserve the past, and provide an anchor for our collective memory.


A TALE OF THE HOUSE THAT SACK BUILT
LEAD: When Israel Sack, a Lithuanian immigrant, began selling New England highboys and Philadelphia chairs to Bostonians at the turn of the century, the experience of collecting American antiques was akin to high adventure.
That, in any case, is the way Harold Sack and Max Wilk describe it in ''American Treasure Hunt,'' published recently by Little, Brown and Company ($24.95).

PREVENTIVE DETENTION: A CONCEPT GOES ON TRIAL
LEAD: IN one of the more important criminal law disputes of the decade, the Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on the constitutionality of the ''preventive detention'' of allegedly dangerous but unconvicted criminal defendants.
The issue is at the center of the great divide between civil libertarians and advocates of tougher law enforcement.


More Bosses
LEAD: To the Editor:  ''When the Boss Is Unbearable'' (Dec. 28) offers a variety of ''solu tions'' for dealing with ''weak, willful and devious'' bosses.
All of these so-called solutions, be they ''keeping your distance,'' ''apple polishing'' or ''grinning and bearing,'' have one fatal flaw.
All are based on the assumption that an individual worker can and must continue to deal on an individual basis with a monstrous boss.


HARRY DARBY
LEAD: Harry Darby, a Republican political figure in Kansas, died yesterday at the Bethany Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan.
He was 91 years old.

30,000 Hail Penn State
LEAD: This small college town was decked in blue and white today as a crowd estimated at 30,000 by the State Police honored Penn State's national championship football team at a parade through the campus and downtown.
Penn State (12-0) defeated Miami, 14-10, in the Fiesta Bowl Jan. 2 for the title.


COLOMBIA'S PRESS UNITED TO FIGHT DRUGS
LEAD: Colombia's newspapers and radio and television stations, reacting in concert to a surge of drug-related violence, are warning that this country is in danger of falling under the ''total domination'' of narcotics traffickers.


IN TRUCE, FILIPINO REBELS PRESS A POLITICAL WAR
LEAD: Striding through rice fields, Ka Christine, nine months pregnant, sang to herself with more enthusiasm than melody: ''Wave the red flag, advance the revolution.''


WHEN SALT MUST BE RESTRICTED, THERE ARE TASTY ALTERNATIVES
LEAD: SOME seasonings are roughly interchangeable.
Tarragon can stand in for chervil and, in a pinch so can parsley.
Vinegar instead of lemon is another effective substitution as is black pepper for cayenne.
But no seasoning does exactly the same job of bringing up flavor as salt.
When a diet requires salt to be restricted it becomes a challenge for the cook.


Dr. Goldberg Wed To Fellow Dentist
LEAD: Dr.
Gari Ellen Goldberg, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Maurice Goldberg of Brooklyn, and Dr.
Charles Henry Bloom, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Lewis M. Bloom of Edison, N.J., were married last evening.

SECONDARY IMAGES IN VAN GOGH'S LANDSCAPES
LEAD: To the Editor: While Michael Brenson is haunted by the faces in van Gogh's landscapes  [ Jan. 4 ] , I am haunted by many of his statements: First of all, by his contention that ''van Gogh has never been identified with reason.'' I do not know (nor do I care) with what Mr.
Brenson identifies van Gogh, but let him show us, in the three volumes of the painter's collected letters, a single unsound passage or argument.

Fighting Imports
LEAD: To the Editor:  I can't help but think that I have met the enemy - and he is Jerry K. Pearlman of Zenith Electronics Corporation (''Save the Lectures, Give Us Some Help,'' Forum, Dec. 14).
Why shouldn't I be allowed to trade peacefully with any other citizen of the world?
Why shouldn't I be allowed to buy a color TV from Korean, Japanese or


GAMBITLESS VERVE
LEAD: It is unusual for a game to be seriously considered for a brilliancy prize if it does not feature sacrifice of material.
One may surmise that, if a player ingeniously maneuvers to obtain a clearly better position and presses the attack relentlessly and with great style, the judges still feel he is not venturing anything and hence is not making the supreme prize effort.


OPERA: 'ATYS', BY LULLY, IN PARIS
LEAD: Jean-Baptiste Lully was the great operatic composer of the high French Baroque, the man who defined French opera in the age of Louis XIV.
His works are rarely heard today, but that omission may be ending now that the French early-music movement has grown so confident and accomplished.
Friday night at the Salle Favart, the Paris Opera presented Lully's ''Atys'' for the first time since 1760, when Lully's works were swept aside in the enthusiasm for the new music of Rameau and then Gluck.


Learning On the Job
LEAD: Having worked as a newspaper reporter, wire-service foreign correspondent, magazine editor and publisher for more than 50 years, I found myself in complete agreement with A. M. Rosenthal's articulate defense of the First Amendment (''Learning on the Job,'' Dec. 14).
It would be a better world if the freedom to write and the freedom to think were universal.

ISLANDERS LEARN WHY FLYERS ARE NO.1
LEAD: Beaten again, and by Philadelphia, the team they need to learn how to subdue in order to be contenders for the Patrick Division title, the Islanders showered and dressed slowly, ruminatively.
That they were in no hurry to board the bus waiting outside had much to do with its destination: Philadelphia, where this home-and-home series will conclude

Finding Tax Shelter in a Second Home
LEAD: FOR the thousands of individuals who own second homes, 1987 will mark a key turning point for tax benefits.
People who rent out their vacation houses must decide whether to begin using the home as a second residence, so they can deduct the mortgage interest, or whether to continue renting so they can claim a loss on the business venture.


Raiders Of the Sacred Sites

Myer Medine.

ARE BASEBALL PLAYERS ASKING TOO MUCH?
LEAD: I am in the minority who believe that baseball players are not asking too much.
First of all, for most of the game's history, ballplayers were virtual slaves of the owners.
Secondly, ballplayers are entertainers just as actors are.
Yet there is no outcry when stars receive millions of dollars for cameo roles in films, even though those fees help push up the cost of our ticket prices.


EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ON HOLOCAUST URGED
LEAD: THE Westchester Holocaust Memorial Committee is planning a $1 million ''living memorial'' to victims of Nazi atrocities, and county agreement is expected this month, members of the group said last week.


Fuming

THE BARBARISM OF THE STEEL-JAW TRAP
LEAD: THE Suffolk County Legislature recently voted for a bill to ban the use of steel-jaw traps to capture animals.
I was amazed to read that this is the first ban of these in this state, as I would have thought that these barbaric and cruel traps would have been banned long ago, particularly in the suburbs where the population is increasing and the habitat of small wild animals is rapidly dwindling.


POOR SUBSTITUTIONS BLAMED IN NETS' LOSS
LEAD: The game seemed to turn during one forgettable stretch in the second period.
In the aftermath, Coach Dave Wohl would blame himself for a series of ill-advised substitutions, but it was clearly just another example of what ails the Nets these days: When a lead dissolves, they are simply unable to grab it back.


THE ROOF OF THE WORLD BY BUS, CAR AND FOOT
LEAD: Benares, India's ancient holy city astride the Ganges, houses the only temple built by Mohandas K. Gandhi.
It has neither Sivas nor Gneshes, only a huge relief model of India.
Gandhi included Tibet in his vision of a unified India.
Mao Zedong disagreed.


SHELTERED BAHAMA ISLES

Technology Stocks: An Investment Strategy
LEAD: Historically, technology stocks have outperformed rising markets, notes Marc G. Schulman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers.

At the same time, it makes a provocative, even compelling, argument that American prisoners are still held in Vietnam and Laos.

LEAD: It turns out that he played five games this season with a fractured jaw.
Two other games on a cracked big right toe.

Comes now ''The Tortellis.'' He's unscrupulous; she's dumb; everyone lives in Las Vegas, Nev.

It's not great, but here and there it has moments.

BANGKOK HOUSES PUT ON EUROPEAN AIRS
LEAD: A ROMAN extravanganza, a cosy corner of Bavaria, the whitewashed stucco of Iberia: they could all be part of a Floridian fantasy or the makings of a southern California developer's brochure.

Authors, Artists, Amateurs and Women

STAGE: 'TASTER'S CHOICE'
LEAD: IN Christopher Blake's ''Taster's Choice,'' James Jenner plays a food critic who has completely lost his sense of taste and smell.

A BIG-BAND WEEKEND IN TWO BOROUGHS
LEAD: BIG bands - a term for jazz-related orchestras of 10 to 25 musicians - were popular once, as popular as today's heavy-metal rock and heavily amplified folk-rock.
But the public grew tired of hearing shouting trumpets, thundering drummers and fast, flashy unison passages for saxophones.
Which is a shame, because many swing-band fans of the 30's and 40's rarely got to hear what a creative big band is really capable of.

ART: JOSEPH CORNELL'S BOXED EPHEMERA COLLAGES
LEAD: LIKE a tropical fish exposed to the air, a Joseph Cornell exhibition reviewed loses its luster as well as its life.
Art - or the ritual of its appreciation - is not the element of these boxed ephemera, perhaps because they themselves don't behave like art.
Most come in clusters for, as John Bernard Myers has pointed out, ''continuity and repetition were necessary to the unfolding of the basic theme, to the vision,'' yet each remains a little magnetic field on its own.


Infinity in a Flake
LEAD: Walk out into the newly fallen snow and, without feeling a crunch under your foot, you will be crushing thousands on thousands of nature's most marvelously varied creations.

BOOKS OF THE TIMES
LEAD: CHARADE. By John Mortimer. 188 pages.


MORRIS GETS AHEAD BY SLOWING DOWN
LEAD: At first glance, it would seem that Joe Morris of the Giants - whom general manager George Young calls ''our home-run runner'' - contradicts the accepted verity that patience is a virtue.


USX Raises Prices
LEAD: The USX Corporation's steel unit announced increases in the published prices of steel products effective May 5.

Illinois Pulls Funds From First Chicago

LEAD: Some were smiling, some were grim, as they struggled through the snowstorm.
Hats were an asset, umbrellas a handicap, as the snow blew in at every angle.


Real Estate; Slim, High Building in Manhattan
LEAD: IT comes as no surprise to people familiar with the difficulty of assembling sites for development in Manhattan that many new buildings are slim and high.
The merger of zoning lots makes it possible to continue residential development in locations with high land values without demolishing all the buildings on the site, which would dispossess all tenants.

John Joseph Latue Walton of Sunderland, England, graduated from the Imperial College of Science and Technology of the University of London.


DRAMATIC FOOD, DRAMATIC SETTING
LEAD: IT was the lure of tapas that brought me to the Grand Cafe in Glen Cove.
Those trendy Spanish appetizers had finally made it to Long Island.
But tapas at the Grand Cafe included spanakopita, ratatouille, pasta salad and quiche -none Spanish, all lackluster.
As a result, it was goodbye tapas and cavernous barroom, hello balcony dining room and sit-down dinner.

Dodd, Mead &amp; Company. 159 pages. $12.95.


How Should We Celebrate the Constitution?
LEAD: As we commemorate in 1987 the 200th anniversary of the Constitution, we will inevitably be pulled toward two seductive but ultimately inappropriate impulses.
We will be tempted, first, to trivialize the event - to turn it into a glitzy collage of fireworks, essay contests and 30 second television moments.


WHITE PLAINS OPENS NEW TRAIN STATION TOMORROW
LEAD: A THREE-YEAR nightmare for White Plains railroad commuters - climbing temporary wooden stairs to stand on narrow, windswept platforms - should end tomorrow morning with the opening of the city's new $2.57 million train station.

THE BENEFITS OF BEING A HOST PARENT
LEAD: ACQUAINTANCES and even somefriends were puzzled.

AH, THE LUXURY OF A ROARING FIRE
LEAD: LAST Sunday, as I sat reading the paper in the meager light of a December afternoon, my next-door neighbor arrived with an armful of freshly split maple logs.
He had just taken down a diseased tree, strewing his front lawn with more wood than he needed.
My own woodpile, sorely depleted after five years of occasional and purely decorative fires, required replenishing; so at his invitation,


RIGHTS CEDED FOR SOCIETY'S GOOD
LEAD: INVOKING what one conceives to be his Constitutional rights has become a very popular activity.
The tobacco companies do it when they feel that Congress might curtail their advertising, motorcyclists do it when they oppose helmet laws, some individuals do it whenever they don't like something, and now, a


Sam May Not Play It Again
LEAD: You won't find a proposal to edit Humphrey Bogart's films on Congress's agenda right now.

Permutations on a Coup

Put a Permanent Lid on Payroll Taxes
LEAD: MAJOR increases in Social Security payroll tax rates, scheduled for 1988 and 1990, will boost the total employer-employee tax rate to an astonishing 15.3 per cent.
Besides imposing an untenable and unfair economic burden on American workers - particularly those with lower incomes - these increases will undermine


Doctors And the Humane Touch
LEAD: It is hard not to be skeptical about the ''new approach to medical education'' described in Amy Wallace's article ''Teaching the Humane Touch'' (Dec. 21).
In fact, the title itself is trendy enough to make one want to run to the nearest technocratic physician he can find.


TOPICS
LEAD: FVE days a week, a few minutes before 9 in the morning, and just at 3 in the afternoon, I walk outside school.
In fact, every teacher in the school is outside to assure the safe arrival and departure of all students.

On Rereading 'Native Son'
LEAD: I recently read ''Native Son,'' and I must say that any shortcomings in the writing style were not so apparent to me.
Perhaps my not being a critic permitted me the freedom of approaching the book simply from the standpoint of its emotional impact.
As far as I'm concerned, it did the job.


BALTIMORE MAYOR ASCENDS TO STATE

The Sea Of Darkness
LEAD: When President Reagan says, ''It is in our interest to stand with those who would take arms against the sea of darkness,'' he is not misquoting Hamlet so much as confusing two romantic worlds: William Shakespeare's Renaissance and George Lucas's ''Star Wars'' (''By the Beautiful Sea,'' by William Safire, On Language, Dec.

HOSTAGES' FAMILIES SAY THEIR EFFORT IS A CASUALTY OF THE IRAN ARMS AFFAIR

U.S. Is Using The Dollar To Twist Some Arms

It's total confusion.
No one knows what the heck is going on.'' The apparent chaos on Wall Street was closely linked to financial events around the world.

S.R.O. BILL HAS ROOM FOR COMPLAINT
LEAD: IN the alphabet soup of municipal government, the letters ''S.R.O.'' have taken on special meaning.
New York City officials have wrestled for months over the fate of the city's remaining 52,000 rooms in S.R.O., or single-room-occupancy, hotels.
They arrived at a solution last week, but it was not easy and it was not popular.


TONING UP AT THE SLEEKEST OF HEALTH SPAS
LEAD: ''It is,'' said one obviously enchanted guest, ''like summer camp, except that you don't have to sew on name tapes.'' In fact you don't have to take much in the way of clothing, or cosmetics.

LEAD: New York City's Board of Estimate couldn't decide last week whether to adopt new zoning intended to keep the heart of Broadway emblazoned with the big electric signs known around the world.

From Swords to Knives in Kyoto
LEAD: Nishikikoji (familiarly referred to as just Nishiki), a narrow arcaded street in the heart of central Kyoto, is the market basket of Kyoto's food lovers.

Star Wars Stampede
LEAD: If a new Democratic Congress were to make a difference in only one thing, it probably ought to be in President Reagan's plan for a ''Star Wars'' strategic defense.

The In Crowd Is Watching Apple

Taylor Honored

Q and A
LEAD: Landlord-Access Rules  Question: Does someone have the right to buy the apartment I rent in a co-op building even though I'm living there?

Newsman Regarded as Hostile.'' I was, in fact, being expelled by a Government that no longer wished me to chronicle its country's internal struggle.
But hostile?
Had I been hostile to South Africa in my three years as chief of The Times's bureau in Johannesburg, then surely that last ride along the freeway would have been laden with relief.

Repertory May Be Solution for U.S. Opera Companies
LEAD: Is it permissible for one who is not a licensed seer to offer a few speculations about the future of opera in America?
For some years it has seemed to me that in New York we have a laboratory in which certain volatile developments in the art form may be observed at close range.
Under the microscope we see, side by side, a Metropolitan Opera committed to an international star system that no longer works with any consistency and a New York City Opera that, on a shoestring, has gone a long way toward building a repertory company of mostly American artists.

Detectors That Talk to the Front Desk

Switzerland

LEAD: THE turmoil in corporate America is forcing the nation's business leaders to undertake the most radical reassessment of their practices and beliefs since the end of World War II.

LEAD: IT'S the night before the party, the pots on the stove are simmering, the sweatsuit has a few new stains -some chicken stock here, a dab of mousse there - and finally, it's time to flop and relax with ''Wheel of Fortune'' or ''Moonlighting'' or ''L.A.
Law.'' Well, in just a minute - a little snack first.


'Scientific Morality' Meets Political Reality
LEAD: FANG LIZHI was a symbol of the new China, a Princeton-trained astrophysicist who inspired students with calls for academic freedom and independent thinking.

Snakeskin
LEAD: THE SKINS OF TWO RATTLESNAKES, TROPHIES OF A sort, were nailed to boards in my great-uncle's library.
They were stiff, like old parchment documents, and flattened, as if run over, and crinkled, like discarded tinfoil.


HARP: NICANOR ZABALETA
LEAD: NICANOR ZABALETA resolves the enigmas of the harp as few others do, which may explain why almost half a houseful of listeners fought their way through Thursday's snowstorm to hear the 80-year old Spaniard play at Alice Tully Hall.

A GIFT TO LAST A LIFETIME
LEAD: WE had hoped for a white Christmas and got drizzle instead.
It forced the young cast of ''The Living Creche'' to abandon its rustic lean-to on the church lawn and pose instead, rather self-consciously, before the altar inside.
It was a lovely Christmas Eve, nonetheless.


EDUCATROS LEARNING TO BE LITERARY TUTORS
LEAD: ONE HUNDRED employees of the state's Department of Education, including Dr.

FURNITURE FINISHES THAT AREN'T JUST PAINT
LEAD: DOROTHY DIAMOND'S studio in New Canaan has no easels, no brushes and no wet paint.
Yet The Studio, as her year-old shop is aptly called, is home to the ''painted finish'' look that is increasingly popular in decor.


2 Bombings in Italian Alps
LEAD: Two bombs exploded a minute apart today near the homes of local politicians in Bolzano, the capital of Alto Adige, an Alpine region racked by tensions between ethnic Germans and Italians.
The explosions blew out windows but caused no injuries.
No immediate claim of responsibility was reported.

Your Cigarettes Or Your Job, Workers Are Told

LEAD: Mayor Koch began a five-day private visit to Poland this evening by ladling out moderate praise for Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski, calling the Polish leader ''one of the most interesting public figures in the world.''


IN PRAGUE TODAY, TREASURES OF THE PAST
LEAD: Great capitals are usually hard to ignore: as cultural, economic and political centers, they attract crowds of travelers year after year, and are, if anything, overexposed.
Yet right in the center of Europe, one of the most attractive cities ever built, long the residence of the Holy Roman Emperors, is often overlooked - a fact all the more surprising because, unlike many of its neighbors, it largely escaped the ravages of the last world war.


Beaux-Arts Sketches: Grace Under Pressure
LEAD: Among the ordeals that faced the young French painter who wanted to climb the official ladder in the 19th century none was either more daunting or more decisive than the historical composition contest that was held every year between 1816 and 1863 at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.
Success in that contest was the indespensible preliminary to all the other competitive stages that led in time to the Rome Prize.


Words About Minimalism
LEAD: To the Editor:


WAITING ROOM LITERARY CLUES
LEAD: THE sniffle season being in full flow, it is small wonder that the winter is turning out to be another festival of medicine in many homes.
I myself, like any used car, have been in regular attendance for oil change, odd noises in the transmission, creakiness in gear shift and suggestions for getting more mileage with less fuel intake.


Alexia Larr Engaged To Richard W. Duker

A LEVERAGED MACY'S WAITS FOR THE REWARDS
LEAD: IN early 1985, Edward S. Finkelstein, chairman of R. H. Macy &amp; Company, the nation's fourth-largest department store chain, found himself increasingly preoccupied with two problems.
Some of his most talented executives were restless; a few were leaving for better-paying jobs with more authority at other retailers.


ECONOMY IS KEY AS IRISH GO TO POLLS
LEAD: ON the day after he called for the dissolution of Parliament last week, and scheduled a national election, Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald, an economist by profession, said the election would be won and lost on economic issues.
Did that not mean, asked a reporter, that Dr.
FitzGerald would be running against his own record?


WILL INSTANT REPLAY TRIP THE REF?
LEAD: WEEKS BEFORE this afternoon's kickoff of Super Bowl XXI, Tex Schramm, the president and general manager of the Dallas Cowboys, sat in his office in Irving, Tex., and worried.

ON THE SUPER BOWL, OR ANYTHING, AMERICA IS READY TO BET
LEAD: BY the time the Giants and Denver Broncos finish butting heads in Super Bowl XXI today, about 130 million Americans, or more than one in two, will have watched at least part of the game on television.
And to judge from the comments of bookmakers, police officers and gambling industry observers, a good number of those people will have made a wager on the outcome.


Smoke Out
LEAD: To the Editor:  Scott Edward Stapf's reference to a nonsmoker's nicotine-equivalent exposure and to other red herrings is an exercise that contributes nothing to the social debate on passive smoking (''A Propaganda War Against Cigarettes,'' Forum, Jan. 4).


Doctors And the Humane Touch
LEAD: We were disappointed and puzzled by Amy Wallace's article on medical education.
Through an infuriating use of partial and out-of-context quotes, the article created the absurd impression that Johns Hopkins disdains the humanities and emphasizes only hard-line biomedical curriculums.


MOVIE THEATER IS BACK IN MAINSTREAM
LEAD: THE Clint Eastwood film ''Heartbreak Ridge'' and ''Song of the South'' were the offerings last week at the Webster Theater in Hartford, with a special matinee on Monday of the Walt Disney animated film.

Reading Lips
LEAD: MORE THAN any other item of makeup, red lipstick is capturing the imagination - and the dollars - of American women.
For most of these women, coming to red after seasons of wearing more subtle lipstick is logical.
Women today are putting extra effort into dressing up for evening, and sophisticated makeup seems to be a natural accompaniment.

Letters should include the writer's name, address and telephone number.
We regret that because of the large volume of mail received, we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters.


PERSONAL FINANCE
LEAD: SOON after passage of the tax act last year, many tax specialists and employee benefit consultants were predicting that deferred compensation arrangements for top executives would go the way of the dinosaur.
They reasoned that with a top tax bracket of 28 percent, executives would prefer to take their money now, rather than deferring payment and risking a tax rise later.


SIMMS'S ROUGH RIDE TO PASADENA
LEAD: NOT long before the most significant game of his eight seasons with the Giants, during a week when quarterbacks of Super Bowl teams have been known to produce enough news to fill a forest worth of newsprint, Phil Simms inadvertently capsulized the rise of himself and his team without a word.

The State of the President
LEAD: What's new, coming up on the President's report to Congress, is not the State of the Union but the state of the President.
Starting suddenly, on successive days last November, the Reagan Administration changed.
Six years of genial invincibility have faded fast and that's why this address to Congress ranks in importance with his first one.

THE WOUNDED GIANT REGAINS HIS DIGNITY
LEAD: On a darkening afternoon seven or eight years ago, I sat with my small daughter in Giants Stadium watching Roger Staubach drive the Cowboys 60 or 70 yards for a winning field goal in the last few seconds.
As Rafael Septien's kick went through the uprights, my daughter burst into tears.
The next day, she saw a photo in The Times of Harry Carson sitting in dejection on the Giants' bench and told me she wanted to write to him.


Capasso Pleads Guilty to Tax Evasion Charges
LEAD: In a move that startled nearly everybody concerned, Carl A. Capasso pleaded guilty last week to Federal tax-evasion charges that technically could cost him up to 37 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines.
In a statement issued later, the 41-year-old contractor said he regretted ''errors in judgment'' that resulted in his using funds from his company for his personal expenses.

LEAD: Charities are developing new styles in fund-raising.
And the National Charities Information Bureau is taking a fresh look at the standards it has used for decades to evaluate the leading charities.


A Lackluster G.N.P. Caps a Dismal Year
LEAD: The economy grew at a dull 1.7 percent rate in the fourth quarter, and just 2.5 percent for all of 1986, which had been heralded by many as a 4 or 5 percent growth year.
The fourth-quarter gain was below what most Government and private economists had expected.
Much of the blame goes to the trade deficit, which has remained stubbornly high despite the falling dollar, and lackluster performances in energy and business investment.

Yet, even as audiences are laughing at this idea, a $10 million, 18-screen multiplex is under construction at Univeral City in California.


Doctors And the Humane Touch
LEAD: The attempt to incorporate compassion and understanding into the medical student is a noble concept, but it is a self-selecting process that appeals to the very individuals who need it least.
The overwhelming remaining majority will see this curriculum as the gesture that it is, an isolated course or two in the context of a highly competitive environment populated by compulsive overachievers.

Discovering China's Folk Art
LEAD: For centuries, the elite of China dismissed as trivial the crafts made by villagers for their own use - the leather shadow puppets, paper cutouts, embroideries, batiks and woodblock prints.

Building a Buffer for the 21st Century
LEAD: SOCIAL Security has not been in the news much lately, and with good reason.
In 1983, Congress ended the financial crises that had plagued the Social Security System since the 1970's.

The Cat's Meow: Fake Furs
LEAD: THESE days fake-fur fanciers have little to growl about.
That's because of the preponderance of big-cat facsimiles, which are uncannily like the real thing.

Degrading
LEAD: To the Editor:  Plastic is prominent in litter not only because it is non-biodegradable (''Plastic Falls to Pieces,'' Prospects Jan. 11) but because of its lightness.

Similarly, metal and glass sink to the bottom of streams while plastic floats.


THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE 'REAGAN REVOLUTION'
LEAD: CONSERVATIVES with a historical bent store among their nightmares the fading of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal after the Democrats' huge majorities in Congress were cut sharply in a Republican surge in 1938 and the President became preoccupied by foreign policy.

HARTMAN OFFERS PLAY BY MANET
LEAD: DAVID MAMET'S laconic style can lure one into thinking there must be something more to his plays than reaches the ear.

Mamet's characters have come to represent the poetic innuendos of the inarticulate.

OLD-FASHIONED SWISS SKIING
LEAD: With its very social and pricey ski resorts like St.
Moritz and Gstaad, Switzerland is often avoided by skiers like me -old navy blue parka, lowish boots, longish skis and a hint of the Arlberg technique left over from my racing days.

PROSPECTS
LEAD: High-Tech Turmoil


Doctors And the Humane Touch
LEAD: I am not sure whether the expansion of scientific knowledge and technology to which Ms.
Wallace alludes has made physicians less compassionate, but it has given them the ability to treat their patients effectively.
It is for this, after all, that patients consult them, and it is a service the most compassionate of their predecessors were unable to provide.


Jerusalem
LEAD: To the Editor: I enjoyed your article on Jerusalem (Travel, Dec. 14) but find that, once again, you omitted my family's favorite restaurant in that wonderful city.
Mama Mia in an old stone house on Hillel Street serves delicious, authentic, homemade Italian pastas, sauces, salads, desserts, etc.
It is a kosher dairy restaurant.

LEAD: The Village of Southold, midway up the North Fork at the eastern end of Long Island, is about to acquire an empty parcel of land in the middle of the town that will forever be preserved as the village green, or public park.


The Brookvilles
LEAD: THE brooks that run through the Brookvilles cut across the wooded grounds of vast estates, skirt the well-kept fairways of the area's many golf courses and wind along tree-lined country roads.
Years ago, these narrow waterways gave this Long Island community its name; today, they continue to add to its nonpareil beauty.


ROSE BOWL SPRUCES UP FOR THE BIG SHOW
LEAD: THE Rose Bowl sits in a dry river bed called the Arroyo Seco, its west bank at the foot of the Linda Vista Hills.

THE ASTRONAUTS AFTER CHALLENGER
LEAD: BEFORE THE unthinkable happened on that bitterly cold January day in Florida, they were the elite's elite, operating in that strange, unforgiving stratosphere where only several hundred humans have ever been.

WITNESS AT THE FREE-FOR-ALL
LEAD: In 1951, 12 years before his death, Jean Cocteau began keeping a diary.
Its existence was kept a secret until 1983, when the first of six volumes was published in Paris.

The Talks, Says Shultz, Kept Going
LEAD: Secretary of State George P.

OVETT'S VICTORIES UPHOLD A TRADITION
LEAD: WHEN ''Chariots of Fire'' won a bagful of Oscars five years ago, the scriptwriter, Colin Welland, received his award with the hyperbolic boast that ''The Brits are coming.''

The Surrogate's Baby Comes First
LEAD: A little boy's truck is a toy, not a harbinger of a career in the trucking industry.
A little girl's doll is not simply a doll but a symbol of the baby she's expected to have some day.
Small wonder, therefore, that women are so often devastated when they find themselves infertile.
Men may wish just as fervently to be fathers but women have been programmed for parenthood, socially as well as physiologically, almost since birth.

ART: 'THE AGE OF SULTAN SULEYMAN'
LEAD: Inch for inch, ''The Age of Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent'' is one of the most spectacular exhibitions ever set before the American public.
It is also in some ways one of the most demanding.
Not only does it deal with folkways remote from our own, but it also asks us to empathize with a great warrior, statesman and administrator who authorized the execution of his sons and grandsons while overseeing the growth of an empire that stretched from Aden to Algiers, from Cairo to the Crimea, and Baghdad to the outskirts of

Market Place; Small Buyers' Timely Moves
LEAD: WALL STREET savants are fond of saying that small investors usually come into a bull market too late, sell too late and generally exhibit poor timing.

SHOW FOR SPORTSMAN

Monday Night Football
LEAD: Maintaining Super Bowl suspense is also a matter for Japanese fans, several million of whom will stay home tonight to watch the game on delayed tape.
Because the broadcast begins 10 hours after the final gun, the trick is to get through the day without learning the result.

Some Nerve in the Philippines
LEAD: How Corazon Aquino must enrage her foes: she refuses to fight like a man.
On the left, zealots thirst for martyrs and shootings, the stuff of revolution.
So what does the President of the Philippines do?
She opens her palace to fist-shaking demonstrators and orders her Cabinet ministers to greet them, for heaven's sake, in an arms-linked human chain of bureaucrats, businessmen, students and Roman Catholic nuns.

One Way to Keep Smiling
LEAD: When he was a running back at Auburn, Bo Jackson, the 1985 Heisman Trophy winner who became an outfielder for the Kansas City Royals, was occasionally criticized for letting minor injuries keep him on the sidelines.

Topics: Lessons Learned; Educator in Exile

But that song, ''The Way It Is,'' moved steadily up the pop charts to No. 1 after its release last September, and it has made Bruce Hornsby and the Range one of the leading new bands to emerge in 1986, selling more than 1.7 million copies of their first album, also titled ''The Way It Is'' (RCA).
