HOSPITALS AND NURSING
LEAD: From the point of view of a registered nurse, the article ''A Great Hospital in Crisis'' (by M. A. Farber and Lawrence K. Altman, Jan. 24) was very interesting, especially for what it did not say.

She can't understand it.

Partnership Swells 'High Tide'
LEAD: Lilli is a loser who has landed in Eden.

New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  FAST LANES, by Jayne Anne Phillips. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $5.95.) Unlike the selections in her first collection of short fiction, ''Black Tickets,'' many of these stories of dispossessed drifters are unfocused and even a bit cliched, Jay McInerney said here last year.
But in the best of them, such as ''Bluegill,'' in which a young woman engages in a monologue with her unborn child, ''events have a dreamlike inevitability.


The Dance: Sally Gross

About Men; The Art of Losing
LEAD: THE SCORE GOES TO 3-0, then to 5-0, then on to 8-0, the ball wildly ricocheting out of the corners of the court and away from my ineffectually flailing swings and tardy bursts of mock speed.

LEAD: There are 10 finalists, including such luminaries as David Robinson, the former Navy basketball star, and the noted gymnast, Scott Johnson, but when the Sullivan Award is presented to the nation's top amateur athlete in Indianapolis tomorrow night, the betting would have to be on Greg Foster.

Music: Modern Bill by Gerard Schwarz
LEAD: IF there was a conclusion to be drawn from Gerard Schwarz's Music Today program Wednesday evening at Merkin Concert Hall, it was that contemporary composers have slowly found their way out of the woods: The earliest work offered, Harrison Birtwistle's ''World Is Discovered'' (1961), was virtually impenetrable, while the latest, Richard Danielpour's ''First Light'' (1988), was instantly accessible.

Just a decade ago it was marked by bold discordancies and feisty lyrics: alternate life styles, swinging, open marriage.

The Editorial Notebook; Walks in the Woods

The Essence Of Hungary's Cuisine: Paprika
LEAD: PAPRIKA is to the entrees and main dishes of Hungary what whipped cream is to its desserts and pastries: it is theoretically possible to do without, but on the evidence of many a meal in homes and restaurants, the dominant hue of the first and second courses is rosy more often than not, and what follows is likely to be hiding under a billow of white.

CRIME
LEAD: In DOWNRIVER (Houghton Mifflin, $15.95), Loren D. Estleman is back where he belongs, with his tough private eye Amos Walker.
The eighth in this Detroit series, the book bears a slight resemblance to Robert B.

An Influx of New Money Revs Up the Market
LEAD: At least 300,000 people in the United States collect old cars for love or money or both.

The Oslo Philharmonic Has Come a Long Way
LEAD: Although experiments have shown that orchestras cannot often get along without conductors, it is an open secret that they cannot always get along with them, either.

The dreaded Internal Revenue Service audit.
This year, more than two million Americans will learn firsthand what the word means, when their tax returns are selected for examination.

NONFICTION
LEAD:  MANHATTAN WATER-BOUND: Planning and Developing Manhattan's Waterfront From the Seventeenth Century to the Present.
By Ann L. Buttenwieser. (New York University, $35.) At first glance, the photograph on the jacket of ''Manhattan Water-Bound'' seems at odds with the title.

Timeless Truths of the Dutch Landscape

A Political Song That Casts Its Vote For the Money
LEAD: What's the most offensive music video clip ever?

LET'S GO TO THE VIDEOTAPE, TOLSTOY

A TOP GUN FOR TAXPAYERS: Rubin Gorewitz, C.P.A.; 8,000 New Battles at the 1040 Corral
LEAD: ''AIIYIIYII!'' Rubin Gorewitz said. ''This is so stupid!

'Blood Knot,' About Apartheid
LEAD: IT'S a rare day when problems arising from South Africa's policy of apartheid fail to make news.
But even the most detailed report cannot examine the emotional, soul-searing effects of apartheid on the people living the headlines.
Communicating the secrets of the human heart is the job of literature and the arts, and the South African playwright Athol Fugard's drama ''The Blood Knot'' is a case in point.

Supertitles: The Eyes Have It
LEAD: Religion used to be the topic that well-bred people did not bring up in polite company.
Now it is supertitles.
The rapid spread of captioned opera and the surprisingly enthusiastic acceptance of the device, on this continent and in Europe, has served to inflame both advocates and opponents.

Focusing on Pro Hockey, and How It Oughta Be
LEAD: Dave Anderson did himself proud with his open letter to the ceremonial leader of the National Hockey League.
Watching the young United States team push the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia to the limit in brilliantly, cleanly played games was something to behold.
All those newspaper critics who lamented the results lost sight of the bigger story: that Olympic hockey was hockey ''as it oughta be'' as opposed to the sickening goonery of the N.H

LEAD: Thirty United States senators wrote to Secretary of State Shultz to support his Middle East peace plan and to criticize Prime Minister Shamir for rejecting the heart of the plan - land for peace.

Or are they?


The Piazza della Signoria
LEAD: To trave, as we did, from Venice direct to Florence is to experience the Time Machine at its most devastating.

Airport X-Rays
LEAD: To the Editor: Although I hate to disagree with a professional filmmaker, I must take exception to Mel London's remarks (Letters on Travel, Jan. 24) regarding lead pouches to protect film from airport X-rays.

Russia's Old and Rival Capitals
LEAD: WITH JUST FOUR WORDS - ''LOVED LENINGRAD, hated Moscow'' - first-time visitors to the Soviet Union have been summing up their feelings ever since Intourist hung up its shingle.

In Leningrad, visitors feel bouyant, alert and subtly flattered.

About Men; The 7-Month Itch
LEAD: AS A RULE OF thumb, a man has as many barbers in his lifetime as he has affairs.
This includes one-cut visits as well as liaisons that go on for years.
The similarities between the two relationships extend to the sensitive courtship, or tryout, period, the growing intimacy and fear of intimacy, the meetings that result in complete satisfaction and those that disappoint a little or a lot, and ultimately - and perhaps inevitably - the guilt at the end.

The Impropriety of Hugging a Mike
LEAD: When you watch pop singers in a nightclub or on television, you usually see them hugging and kissing the microphone.
Such passionate gestures toward the hardware are meant to underline the performer's capacity for emotional abandon, but they are not likely to produce good sound.
In fact, the hand-held mike subjected to these dramatic antics is usually supplemented by another microphone, known as the body mike, sequestered in the singer's clothes to yield an acceptable sound balance - and the output of nearby stage microphones is also blended in.

A Critic's Quandary: What's Authentic?
LEAD: For the past few months I've been enjoying an album as exotically euphonious as the name of the Indonesian singer who made it: Idjah Hadidjah. ''Tonggeret'' (Nonesuch 79173 LP, cassette and CD) is a compilation of Ms.
Hadidjah's recordings from 1979 to 1986.
As a listener, I can bask in the way it sounds: the serene counterpoint that issues from resonant gongs, a fiddle-like instrument called a rebab, tinkling ''keyed metallophones'' and Ms.

Harbor Views at an Amiable Inn
LEAD: NEAR the reception desk of Danfords Inn in Port Jefferson is a picture of George Washington.
Under it, in a spidery 18th-century hand, is the message, ''I never slept here.'' George wouldn't lie.

DO THE METS AND YANKS NEED MORE PITCHING?

LEAD: Unemployment has fallen to 5.6 percent, the lowest rate in 8 1/2 years.

But most economists say the curve is not an accurate guide.


What Goes Around Comes Around

LEAD: The scene is a room in Odessa.
Five literary men face the camera - all seated, all formally attired in the fashion of 1913.

In the very center sits Simon Dubnow, the foremost Jewish historian of his era.


DO THE METS AND YANKS NEED MORE PITCHING?
LEAD: Yankee pitching needs an owner who knows how to develop good young pitchers within the farm system instead of wasting time on annual shopping trips to baseball's overpriced free-agent market.

Decisions, decisions.
They may be insignificant for consumers, but they are make-or-break ones for the nearly 130,000 fast-food outlets that dot the country.
The recent top-management shakeup at the Pillsbury Company put the spotlight on troubles at its Burger King subsidiary, but if misery likes company, then Burger King must be a happy place: For all the purveyors of fast food, with the exception of giant McDonald's Corporation and tiny White Castle Systems

Totalitarianism, Indoors and Out
Since ''The Case of Herman the Stoker'' makes some effort to penetrate the mind of its subject, a lot of it is about firewood.
Leszek Wosiewicz's short film includes the information that birch logs are good for keeping bad thoughts away and for making a person ready to work.
Maple, on the other hand, produces a more dynamic state of mind.
A man named Herman, who presumably contributed these observations (which are presented by two unseen narrators), learned to make fires when he worked at a mental institution.
Later, once the patients were liquidated, it became a school for German officers during the days of the Third Reich.
Herman was so sensitive to the nuances of firewood, and so adroit at making fires to suit particular personalities, that he came to hold a privileged position within the ranks of the regime; he eventually rose to the honor of building fires for the Fuhrer himself.
Hitler was a maple man.

It won't let go, not now, perhaps not ever.

Review/Music; New Amsterdam Singers
LEAD: The most interesting piece on Sunday's Merkin Concert Hall program by the New Amsterdam Singers was also the least well sung.

Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''Blacks have a rich tradition of spirituality, but it is not a tradition which enriches the Catholic Church unfortunately.

Review/Recital; The Classical Guitars of the Assad Brothers
LEAD: It is probably no accident that so many performing duos consist of siblings.
Sergio and Odair Assad, who played their guitars at Merkin Hall Thursday night, are brothers and look at first glance like twins (they are four years apart).
Their playing is also remarkably together, despite the free, uninhibited approach to the most complex of music.

The Wearing of the Black
LEAD: What should be a day of joy for the Irish, of all nationalities, turns instead into a day of mourning for the victims of yesterday's attack in a Belfast graveyard.
The mourning extends to lost hopes of reconciliation in Northern Ireland: wake follows wake, coffin follows coffin, tears follow tears, in a cycle that defeats reason and obliterates decency on both sides - Northern Ireland's Protestant majority and the

Tax Returns Aren't Speed Trials
LEAD: The Reagan Administration deserves heaps of credit for its war on red tape.
The Office of Management and Budget estimates it has sliced away 560 million hours that people used to spend filling out Federal forms each year.

LEAD: Steve Lacy, the expatriate soprano saxophonist who lives in Paris, usually plays with American jazz musicians when he visits New York.
But through Sunday at Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, he is working with his longtime Paris-based sextet.
Its music is as eccentric and cluttered as a much-used messy desk - or, perhaps, an imaginary Cubist collage of sheet music, saxophone mouthpieces, a book of poetry, toys, cabaret ticket stubs and stamps from North

Review/Rock; Marti Jones's Soulful Voice
LEAD: Marti Jones's show at the Bottom Line on Friday was full of lost possibilities.

The plausible candidates for its leading roles are just too few, and verismo opera does not thrive in unidiomatic performances.
But it is not a good idea to give up hope; just a few years ago, it seemed as though there were not one single international-class soprano who was vocally and temperamentally right for Maddalena de Coigny, and now there is at least one, as Aprile Millo showed in a Carnegie Hall concert performance on

OF A CERTAIN AGE
LEAD: THE MERE MENTION OF A WOMAN'S AGE once sent shudders rippling through polite society.

LEAD: AS a nurse in the same geriatric ward for a few years, I've periodically been restless for a change but never acted upon my wish for it.

After waiting with mixed feelings, I was notified to start on nights the day after my vacation was through.


Practical Traveler; Flying Business Class
LEAD: ECONOMY-CLASS travelers confess to being tortured by curiosity about what is happening on the other side of that curtain near the front that the flight attendants draw so decisively after takeoff.

I never learned much except that carving beef on a little trolley looks like back-breaking work.

East Regional; High-Volume Coaching Spurs Owls and Hoyas
LEAD: As is the case with many coaches, there are similarities in the way John Chaney of Temple and John Thompson of Georgetown go about their jobs, blending the roles of surrogate parent and drill instructor.
Thompson jokingly talked today about how he called the Hoya players just about every nasty thing he could think of during the course of the regular season, reaching a point where the players thought they were probably the worst and dumbest team ever to play for him.


He Gave Elegance to Manhattan's Skyline
LEAD: The death last month of the builder and architect Irwin S.

THE FIRES OF SPRING

LEAD: WE asked 10 computer users familiar with the Macintosh and the I.B.M.
PC's, PS/2's and compatibles to take the standard desert island test. ''If you were stranded and could have only one computer, which would it be?'' The findings of this unscientific survey, which has a margin of error of 100 percent, reveal more about the users who inhabit the different computer universes than about the merits of the two categories of machines.

MADELINE MORRIS  New York


And Now Military Talks
LEAD: The meeting between Soviet and American defense ministers here produced ''no breakthrough,'' as Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci said.
Still, it was a remarkable first, not spring but a sign of changing climate that can gradually lead to a dramatically different sense of the superpower confrontation.


A Honeymoon Revisited, With Children
LEAD: I FIRST visited the south of France in 1961.
That is more than half my life ago, and I have returned often since.
Like so many others, I find myself moved by that landscape - compelled by its long history, dazzled by its light.
Some travelers are drawn to mountains, while some prefer valleys instead; for each pilgrim to the desert there is one who dreams of forests; for each lover of the lakefront there is one who wants the river.


POSTINGS: Home-Buyer's Class; Looking for Affordability
LEAD: Can anyone who is not well-off buy a home in Westchester County these days?

Math Stars in a Movie
LEAD: In 1982, a high-school teacher named Jaime Escalante taught calculus to 18 lower-middle-class Hispanic students in the East Los Angeles barrio.

The Ruthless Young Crack Gangsters

And though police officials say they are confident the gangs can be uprooted by methods that have worked before, other law-enforcement experts and social scientists are less optimistic.


What Hath Norrington Wrought?
LEAD: Classical music-lovers should be amply familiar by this time with the name of Roger Norrington, the English specialist in the period performance of 19th-century music.
Mr.
Norrington's Beethoven symphony recordings have been almost universally admired, and his recent Berlioz weekend in London's Queen Elizabeth Hall, capped by ''authentic'' accounts of the ''Symphonie Fantastique'' and ''Romeo et Juliette,'' were almost more revelatory than his Beethoven.


POSTINGS: By the Sea; Hotel and Town Houses
LEAD: In a one-time resort now being transformed into a bedroom community, Henry V. Vaccaro is hedging his bets.
Along with the first hotel to be built in Ocean Grove, N.J, in 50 years, Mr.

The combination resort-and-conference hotel will have 168 rooms and Victorian architecture.


FATHERS AND SONS ON THE WATERFRONT
LEAD: Your article about the decline of the shipping industry noted that the local economy had undergone rapid change, but it failed to emphasize the benefits that change has brought.

Questions and Answers On Presidential Primary
LEAD: CONNECTICUT will hold its Presidential preference primary March 29.

Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press. $34.95.


Review/Dance FIVE REPLICATIONS IN DORIS HUMPHREY HOMMAGE
LEAD: Though widely acknowledged as a major figure in American modern dance, Doris Humphrey created work whose measured tone and intellectual underpinnings have made it seem relatively inaccessible, and unsusceptible to revivifying personal interpretation.
And so the Philadelphia Dance Theater's presentation of five Humphrey dances, on Thursday at the Marymount Manhattan Theater, was very welcome.


Saving a Study To Save the Sound
LEAD: Members of Congress whose districts border Long Island Sound say they will fight a Reagan Administration proposal that might dilute funding for the three-year-old Federal study of the Sound.

Ruling Clouds Inheritance of Rentals
LEAD: THE appellate court decision last month invalidating succession rights in the rent-stabilization system threw into limbo the status of hundreds of thousands of New York City apartment dwellers.


FOR SPRING ... KEEP IT SIMPLE, KEEP IT EASY
LEAD: As spring rounds the corner, even the most buttoned-up dressers tend to relax, shedding their inhibitions with their heavy winter wraps.
In the spring of 1988, that easygoing attitude will be embodied in loose-fitting, uncomplicated fashions that are certain to make last year's showy plumage seem as dated as a


Habib in Cairo
LEAD: An American envoy, Philip C. Habib, arrived here today to seek the backing of the Egyptian Government for an American plan for peace in the Middle East.
President Hosni Mubarak has called the American plan ''encouraging'' but suggested, without specifics, that some of its provisions be elaborated.

LEAD: Whatever happened to Wally Backman, the prize pupil, the tough little second baseman for the Mets who reminded Dave Johnson of himself as a tough little second baseman?


Photos of fashions and accessories (Cornelia Katchen); DO CLOTHES MAKE THE MAN?
LEAD: Not long ago, shortly after reading Tom Wolfe's ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' and being dazzled by Michael Douglas's wardrobe in the film ''Wall Street,'' I put on a chalk-striped shirt with a white tab collar and walked around in it all day.
It was a subsidized experiment; the shirt wasn't mine.


What Killed Oscar Wilde?
LEAD: To the Editor:


Pain Lingers At City College
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Housewives and Prom Queens, 25 Years Later
LEAD: I find my history in novels - and only after the passage of time.
The feminist novel, which flourished in the 1960's and 70's, held more than met the eye of the reader (and writer in some cases) at the time.
Concealed within these tales are the seeds of many conflicts that bedevil the womens' movement, and women, today, though even if we had been prescient enough to recognize them then, the issues would have remained stubborn, defiant and perhaps insoluble.


Review/Jazz; Breuker's Eclecticism
LEAD: A description of music by the Dutch composer and saxophonist Willem Breuker is inevitably a set of lists: tangos follow be-bop, brass band music merges with snarling free jazz, and unaccompanied saxophone solos follow Hollywood versions of Arabic music.
Mr.
Breuker is an eclectic, and like such fellow pastiche artists as the composers Carla Bley and Henry


Ina W. Halperin Wed To Dr. Joseph L. Young
LEAD: At Congregation Beth El in Bethesda, Md., Ina Weinstein Halperin, the director of career planning and placement at the Washington College of Law of American University, was married last night to Dr.

THE REWARDS OF GRANDCHILDREN
LEAD: I feel sorry for Carol Reiman.
In her essay (''Baby-Sitting Grandchildren: Love Them and Leave Them,'' Opinion page, Feb. 28), she announced that she did not want to baby-sit her grandsons.
Simply put, it exhausted her.


THE TOUGHEST CUSTOMER
LEAD: Four days after we were married, I gave my beloved a tie.
I'd shopped for hours and paid too much, but he was worth it.


Defining the Limits In Reagan's Use of Presidential Power

AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A THIRD PARTY
LEAD: With the campaign between Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and Attorney General Joseph I.

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD:  L. RON HUBBARD: Messiah or Madman?
By Bent Corydon and L. Ron Hubbard Jr. (Lyle Stuart, $20.) The Church of Scientology is a bizarre cult, and its founder and leader, L. Ron Hubbard, was a ''cosmic outlaw,'' in the words of L. Ron Hubbard Jr.
There is little of the son in this book but a good deal of Bent Corydon, who headed one of the Scientology ''missions'' in California during the 1970's until Hubbard decided to take over these lucrative franchises, leaving their well-rewarded leaders bewildered and broke.


KNICKS STRUGGLE TO SALVAGE VICTORY

Review/Opera; NEW 'HOFFMANN' CAST
LEAD: There were five newcomers Wednesday night in the Metropolitan Opera's ''Contes d'Hoffmann'' cast, but the most striking was a familiar face: Placido Domingo in the title role.
Hoffmann surely counts among the celebrated tenor's best parts.
It suits his voice admirably, and he invests the acting with all his considerable intelligence.

TAKING A BITE OUT OF THE BIGGEST STATE
LEAD: At first glance, Alaska seems a bit overwhelming as a vacation site.
The 49th state is a fifth the size of the continental United States, and one of its 5,000 glaciers is larger than Rhode Island.
But Alaska can be toured on a cruise ship or by rail, plane and ferry.

Sophocles With a Chorus Of Gospel
LEAD: When ''The Gospel at Colonus'' had its first performance at P.S. 122 on the Lower East Side in 1980, it was a half-hour show with one actor, five singers, two songs by Bob Telson and just the beginnings of writer-director Lee Breuer's central idea: that the essential nature of Greek tragedy could be revealed to modern audiences by presenting Sophocles' ''Oedipus at Colonus'' in the form of a black Pentecostal church service.


Stepping Back In Time in The Caribbean
LEAD: WHEN word got around the island of Nevis not long ago that construction of a new golf course was being contemplated, the response from most Nevisians and long-time foreign residents was predictable: why build something we already have?
That the existing course has only one hole - making it the only one-hole course in the West Indies and perhaps anywhere, for that matter - was irrelevant to most residents, who felt that one hole was quite enough.

How Should The Mets Handle Strawberry?
LEAD: What Darryl Strawberry did in January of this year was no different from what Lee Mazzilli and Wally Backman did in July of last year, or from what Keith Hernandez did in September of 1984.
When Strawberry's teammates tell the media that he quit, it's to motivate him; when Strawberry says that his teammates were unmotivated, he's mouthing off, creating distractions.


Presidential Obsession
LEAD: THe President who sent the Marines to Lebanon on a mission without a purpose has now sent 3,000 American soldiers to Honduras.
Once again their mission is unclear.
Once again professional military people are troubled.


How Should The Mets Handle Strawberry?

Riches Abound in 'The Woods'
LEAD: While immersed last week in the magnificent original cast recording of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's fairy-tale musical, ''Into the Woods'' (RCA Victor 6796-2RC; all three formats), I was reminded of how crucial a cast album can be to the future reputation of a show.
If the score is first rate and the performances finely tuned, no matter what a show's short-term commercial fate, its cast album will keep the music circulating and win for it future champions who may never have seen it produced.


Gay Rights Bill Cheered in Vermont
LEAD: The worst thing was the isolation.

New York: The Free Press. $19.95.


THE CONTINUING PASSION FOR PEARLS
LEAD: PEARLS HAVE ALWAYS fueled a panoply of emotions.
They have been lusted after and fondled in the names of both propriety and passion.
Royalty has always been bedecked with ropes of them, fathers indulge their daughters with them and career women, finding them a luxury within reason, treat themselves to a modest strand or two.


Yo, Brutus! A Bard for the 80's
LEAD: ''I am no orator, as Brutus is,'' says Al Pacino as Mark Antony, wooing the Roman mob, ''but, as you know me all, a plain blunt man.'' Indeed, prowling a stage at the Public Theater during previews of ''Julius Caesar,'' Mr.

ABOUT BOOKS
LEAD: ''SANDY HOOK pilots know a nor'west blizzard when it comes along, and every mother's son of them that got ashore yesterday with a whole skin was willing to swear by the piper that played before Moses that Monday's blow was a blow that could give Sullivan, Mitchell - or any other hard hitter - a deckload of points on the 'knocking out' business and come up smiling for an unlimited number of rounds.


On Foot in a London Village

BOY'S BOOKS: LET SPOT LIVE
LEAD: For Christmas, a (male) friend gave Z our two young sons some pretty authentic-looking handcuffs.
They were the hit of the season.
I was frankly astonished to see my two little angels arresting each other and goose-stepping around the house.
But my husband took it for granted.
He said: ''Well, of course.


Street Fashion; A Safe Spot in the Hem Tempest
LEAD: HEMLINES may rise and hemlines may fall, but trouser lengths stay pretty constant, stopping right there at the top of the shoe (or more and more frequently these days, tucking neatly inside a boot).
Such comforting reliability may be one reason why so many women are turning to trousers to fill an ever-increasing number of sartorial bills.


Tracking the Changing Landscape
LEAD: SHELL GATHERER, high upon a hill, peered down at his fellow tribesmen setting traps and fishing in the wetlands marshes of Mamaroneck Harbor.
It was the early 1600's, and life was good and game was plentiful for his fellow Siwanoy Indians, who with the Wequasgeeks had hunted much of what is now Westchester and the

LEAD: Rejecting the assertions of tobacco companies, a cancer specialist testified this week that a longtime smoker died of lung cancer caused by cigarette smoking.


IRRADIATION ARTICLE CALLED MISLEADING

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD: SOVIET SUCCESSION STRUGGLES: Kremlinology and the Russian Question From Lenin to Gorbachev.
By Anthony D'Agostino. (Allen &amp; Unwin, $45.) One school of thought sees all signs of struggle in the Kremlin as playacting, a device to gull the West into giving aid and comfort to the comparatively ''good'' Soviet leader who is at odds with supposedly ''bad'' domestic foes.

Is the Secretary of Agriculture the Real 'Farmer Brown'?
LEAD: TO MOST New Jerseyans, he is The Honorable Secretary of Agriculture, Mister Arthur Richard Brown Junior.
But to most folks in this Atlantic County agricultural community (population: 3,000), he is just plain ''Farmer Brown.''


Review/Concert; Fischer-Dieskau Returns to New York Stage
LEAD: Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, who had not sung in America since 1980, returned to Carnegie Hall Friday night to sing Mahler's ''Kindertotenlieder'' with the Philharmonia Orchestra of London.
It was easy for him to renew his bond of communication with this public.
Oboe and horn played their brief opening lament; the baritone entered with a quiet reflection that the sun would rise again as though no sorrow had befallen in the night, and instantly we were all in the world of Mahler and Ruckert (the poet) and their close examination of grief.


Peugeot Alive and Going Global
LEAD: WHEN Jacques Calvet, chairman of the Peugeot automobile group, joined the company in 1982, it was in shambles.
It lost $300 million that year, its market share in Europe was plummeting and many analysts said bankruptcy was just around the corner.


Chores for the Season
LEAD: BEGIN cleanup of the lawn; rake off winter's debris, old leaves, twigs and dead grass; add to a compost pile or fill plastic bags for dumping; apply lime if the lawn was not limed in recent years; if no fertilizer was applied late last fall, now is the time; follow rates provided on bags for both lime and fertilizer and use a calibrated spreader to make applications accurate.

Wilson, praised C. S. Lewis for a clever portrayal of ''the devious processes of the diabolical mischief-makers,'' adding that ''somewhere in the inferno there must be considerable annoyance.


Dowsers Lead Rural Quest for Water
LEAD: The Y-shaped wire rod made out of an old clothes hanger quivered in Donald Spohr's outstretched hands as he walked across a hilltop hayfield here.
It quickly rotated toward him and completed an 180-degree arc, pointing straight down.

'The Playmaker' Transposed
LEAD: To the Editor:


Addiction Is a Family Problem, Too

PRINCE CHARLES RECASTS HIS ROLE
LEAD: The effect of Howell Raines's article was to leave me with admiration for Prince Charles, who, against enormous pressure, seems to have made himself something better than he needs to be.
Why, then, does Mr.
Raines say that Charles's education was ''a noble . . . experiment that backfired''?
Judging from its results, it succeeded very well.


We're Not Out of the Deep Deficit Woods Yet; A New Approach

Oddities From Old Kitchens
LEAD: Tools and utensils that kept houses humming a century ago have been dusted off and placed on view at the New-York Historical Society, in an exhibition called ''Bellows, Bobbins and Butter Churns: Keeping House in 19th-Century America.'' Most of the 190 or so items, on exhibit through Oct. 2, were used by women in their daily chores - cooking, spinning, sewing, laundering and keeping their houses heated, lighted and free of pests.


OPINION: CENSORSHIP VS. STEWARDSHIP ON CAMPUS
LEAD: The opinions, pro and con, on the Supreme Court's decision in the Hazelwood High School paper case  [ ''Drawing the Line on Student Rights,'' Feb. 21 ]  were interesting, yet both missed a point, i.e., reality.


MALAYSIA LEADER TIGHTENS HIS HOLD ON THE COURTS

Mahathir's large parliamentary majority this week to push through legislation curbing the power of the judiciary.


Cher: Yes? No? (Check Only One)
LEAD: I guess I loved Cher the most the night she showed up at the Academy Awards looking like a tarantula.
The academy had, pointedly, failed to nominate her for her top-calibre work in ''Mask'' - a calculated disciplinary action that sent shivers down the spine of every former teen-age girl in the audience who had ever been called into the principal's office for yet another futile round of ''life style correction'' measures.


THE HEALTH-CARE CHAOS
LEAD: JUST AS HISTORY teaches that war is too important to be left to generals, so recent American experience teaches that medicine is too important to be left to doctors and politicians.


Just Because It's True, Is It Art?

Eighty-seven students passed the test in 1987.

This is from ''Stranger in the Forest: On Foot Across Borneo'' (Yolla Bolly/Houghton Mifflin).


Pampered Look at the Wild

Review/Theater; 'M. Butterfly,' a Story Of a Strange Love, Conflict and Betrayal
It didn't require genius for David Henry Hwang to see that there were the makings of a compelling play in the 1986 newspaper story that prompted him to write ''M.

Hwang's fictionalized protagonist, by half-joking way of explanation.

DEMOCRACY IS TALKED ABOUT, BUT PINOCHET'S STILL IN CHARGE
LEAD: ON International Women's Day earlier this month, the Chilean military Government outlawed public gatherings and sent army troops in battle gear into busy city streets and crowded shopping malls.

Nepal

Ghost Train
LEAD: To the Editor: ''Riding the Ghost Train'' (Travel, Jan. 31) confirmed my own experiences with Amtrak.

Levity and Politics Mesh As Mayors Push Agenda
LEAD: It's not that Charley Royer and Bill Hudnut do not like and respect each other.

It is just that they cannot resist the fun of flinging verbal darts at each other.


A Veteran Wordsmith Faces the Music
LEAD: I have roamed the writing landscape, going from novels to biographies to short stories to television dramas to ballets to Broadway plays -but despite all that variety, for as long as I can remember I have coveted what I secretly considered the ultimate but elusive spice - writing a musical comedy.

Porter Is Out
LEAD: Abandoning her game to save a child's life won her a special exemption to play in the Turquoise Classic, but becoming a hero hardly helped Mary Bea Porter's golf game.
Plagued by what she described as flashback images of the unconscious child's ashen face as she gave a 2-year-old boy mouth-to-mouth resuscitation March 16, Porter failed to make the cut, and the Turquoise continued without her yesterday at the Moon Valley Country Club in Phoenix,


ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS
LEAD: As a recovering alcoholic, I was pleased to read Nan Robertson's article ''The Changing World of Alcoholics Anonymous'' (Feb. 21).

Now their secret is out.
This is a gem of a restaurant, well worth a trip to Elmont.


STREETSCAPES: General Tire Building; 'Gas Station' Style: An Overlooked Gem of the 1930's
LEAD: FOR the last several years, only an architectural detective would have noticed the building.
Since the early 80's it has been boarded up, completely concealed under a uniform coat of white paint.
But in the last year or so, the paint has peeled off, revealing a minor masterpiece of the 1930's, the Art Deco General Tire Building at 602 West 57th

Venture Capital
LEAD: When Congress eliminated the favorable treatment of capital gains in 1986, many thought it would hurt venture capital companies' ability to raise money.

Ghost Train
LEAD: To the Editor: It's too bad the confused passengers on the Ambus missed their meal at the Polka Dot Cafe around the corner from the railroad station in White River Junction.
We had breakfast there after spending the night across the street at the Hotel Coolidge.

QUESTIONING THE ETHICS OF DUAL-ROLE CONSULTANTS
LEAD: IN an era when influencing government is a big business, the New York State Commission on Government Integrity is focusing on a new type of power broker - the public relations consultant representing private interests who doubles as a fund-raiser for politicians who often control the fate of those same interests.


Designing a Decent Alternative for the Homeless
LEAD: A decade ago, when the number of homeless people in the City of New York was roughly a fifth of what the city estimates it to be today, this problem could not be seen in terms of architecture.
It was more a matter of management, of helping people find what housing existed and getting them the money to pay for it.


Should Baseball Use The Instant Replay?
LEAD: Add instant replay and all you do is add more time for televised beer commercials.
MICHAEL J. VITUCCI  Ithaca, N.Y.


Gambling on Life
LEAD: LAST DECEMBER A major clinical trial to determine whether aspirin could reduce the risk of heart attack in men was suddenly halted.

An Office Casualty: My Right to Smoke

Limited by the narrow choice of offerings in the East End's primarily blue-collar work force, I scan each job description carefully.


OFFICIAL BELFAST BUSIES ITSELF WITH THE SIDE ISSUES OF STRIFE
LEAD: THE burial of the dead inevitably is followed by the resurrection of politics in the ceaseless Irish-Anglo agony.
But a striking quality in the latest episode of violence and despair, the worst in more than a decade, is how much of the post-mortem debate remains focused on surface points of conflict.

New York:  William Morrow &amp; Company. $18.95.


Does It Pay to File Separate Returns?
LEAD: THE Tax Reform Act of 1986 is creating a new trend: his and her tax returns.
Before, almost all married couples saved money by filing joint tax returns.
Couples who filed separately faced higher tax rates.

Islanders Regain First
LEAD: Pat LaFontaine negotiates an ice rink the way a water beetle negotiates a pond.
He skitters across it, preferring a series of zig-zags to the more conventional route.
Even mobile defensemen are left twirling in place from the effort of trying to imitate his path.
Goaltenders, trying to anticipate his every move, see only a darting blur instead of a straightforward forward.


What Happened to the Revolving Door
LEAD: THE CLOSING BELL AT the New York Stock Exchange had not even sounded on Black Monday before Wall Street was blaming the Reagan Administration and Congress for provoking the crash with out-of-control budgets and deliberate debasement of the dollar.

Bimonthly Is Distant Early Warning of the Far-Out

Unseemly Behavior
LEAD: The Rev.
Jeb Stuart Magruder, the former White House aide who spent seven months in jail for his part in the Watergate scandal, just kind of naturally perks up when talk turns to ethics.

DUKE KNOCKS OFF TEMPLE TO GAIN FINAL 4
LEAD: For Temple, it was worse than having a kid brother tag along to the playground for a pickup basketball game, stepping on your toes along the way.
The only place the Owls could find sanctuary from Duke today was in their huddle, and most of those sessions with their coach, John Chaney, were not at all pleasant.


Review/Concert; Cincinnati Symphony
LEAD: With a history dating to 1895, the Cincinnati Symphony is the fifth-oldest orchestra in the country, and it has certainly had its share of conductorial glamour, with the likes of Stokowski and Reiner among its former directors.

The Shapes of Things to Come
LEAD: DESPITE the vast changes that have taken place within 35-millimeter cameras in the last 10 years, including a dramatic shift from mechanical to electronic controls, the outsides have stayed pretty much the same.

THE YUPPIES OF MISSISSIPPI
LEAD: As one who left the ''Great and Sovereign State of Mississippi'' following a number of painful experiences in 1964, I found little cause for joy in Peter J. Boyer's article ''The Yuppies of Mississippi'' (Feb. 28).
Mississippi seems to have replaced rebel-flag-waving bigotry with the self-serving desire to achieve ''drastic change.

LEAD: More than 3,000 people have gathered here to ponder soap operas, nursery rhymes, hair styles and other attributes of American popular culture.


Review/Dance; The Rhythms of Spain By Del Conte Company

Despite Criticism, Fetal Monitors Are Likely to Remain in Wide Use
LEAD: Electronic fetal monitors have been under attack for more than a decade by some women's groups and parts of the medical community.

Romare Bearden: Epic Emotion, Intimate Scale
LEAD: Even though he was 75 and ill for some time, Romare Bearden's death earlier this month was a shock.
It was clear from his work that he loved everything about art.
He trusted materials, trusted the creative process, trusted the people who spoke to him in and across his paper.
His art grew freer, wiser, more poignant in a way that is rare in postwar


Robinson Ready for Next Step
LEAD: Bill Robinson is a black man who wants to be a baseball manager.
He is serious enough about gaining experience that he managed in Latin America over the winter, picking up a roaring case of malaria as a souvenir.


A Veiled Threat
LEAD: TWELVE-FOOT-HIGH walls.
Steel gates.
Dogs and armed guards.
Inside, cool, high-ceilinged old houses, oases of green lawns, servants slipping noiselessly about - and women.

Fiction Fuels the Documentary
LEAD: In Orson Welles's ''Citizen Kane,'' a journalist searches for the motivating force in the life of Charles Foster Kane, the newspaper tycoon.

Evening Fashion; Maximum From a Minimum
LEAD: THE big news in fashion lately has been the rejection by many women of the miniskirt.
Be that as it may, there is still a segment of the population, mostly young and obviously in excellent shape, that has embraced the shorter styles - or rather, let the styles embrace them.
For these women the mini, especially the mini evening dress, is standard attire.


Unacceptable Image
LEAD: Those Soviet parents who have had mixed feelings about the glorification of Pavlik Morozov may be resting easier these days.

The Peninsula by Car; Tijuana to Nopolo

The Alfredo Kraus Secret For Triumphing Over Time

I was born and grew up in the Middle West.
In elementary school, we learned about the group of small states in the Northeast corner of our country where the first settlers battled harsh winters and farmed land that was more rock than soil.
New Englanders, we were told, were fiercely protective of their own way of doing things, a characteristic that time has not erased.

Attaching Wood to Concrete Floor
LEAD: A SURPRISINGLY frequent, though unusual, home-improvement task is attaching wood to concrete.

Take It Easy On Strawberry
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Nepal
LEAD: To the Editor: I had the wonderful experience of trekking in the Nepal Himalayas last fall. ''Preparing for Nepal's Rugged Reality'' by Marcia R. Lieberman (Travel, Feb. 21) was well done but omitted one important bit of advice for anyone about to embark on an experience of a lifetime.
I discovered the most important item in my duffle bag was a Katadyn water filter.

Machines That Cut the Mess to a Manageable Size
LEAD: A NEW industry has been developed over the last few years by companies offering to handle infectious waste ''from cradle to grave,'' transporting the red-bag garbage in special plastic boxes and burning it in incinerators or autoclaving.
Red-bag waste is estimated to account for 10 percent of a hospital's garbage, but it can account for more than half of the disposal budget.

Golden Days for Arbitrage
LEAD: A WALL STREET trader interrupted a telephone interview last week to check on the status of the takeover battle for Federated Department Stores.
The news was good.
Campeau had raised its bid to $73 a share from $68. ''And I bought in late, two weeks ago, at 66,'' he reported. ''Not a bad gain.'' On Wall Street, the talk of big deals and easy money is back.


Should Baseball Use The Instant Replay?
LEAD: Absolutely.
For that matter, why not use electronic strike zones and foul lines.
We won't need instant replays or umpires.
How about automatic pitching machines? . . .
WILLIAM W. AMBROSE  Cambridge, Mass.


Fewer Bursts, Less Bursting
LEAD: THE CBS CORRESPONDENT Bob Schieffer, reporting election returns on one of the primary nights, wondered aloud whether a percentage figure he was giving should be described as less or fewer.
The grammarian on the spot immediately pronounced judgment: when a percentage is used to indicate an amount or quantity, it takes less; when used to describe a number, it takes fewer.


Should a Principal Have Been a Teacher?
LEAD: New Jersey's school principals and many of its superintendents are up in arms over the proposed new requirements for certifying principals.
Elimination of the current requirement that principal candidates have three years of teaching experience is ostensibly at the core of this dissent.


WINNOWING OUR WARHEADS
LEAD: THERE IS A HIGH RISK for the United States in the current strategic arms reduction talks, known as START, that call for a 50 percent reduction in strategic nuclear warheads.
The risk is less in what we negotiate with the Russians than in how we divide up the 50 percent we would be allowed to retain.

Should A Principal Have Been A Teacher?
LEAD: Dr.
McKenzie perpetuates the myth that only former schoolteachers can be school administrators.
Yet his argument fails the final test:


CORRECTIONS
LEAD: A chart on March 6 about the dollar's reach abroad carried obsolete information about a Viennese restaurant.
The establishment, Restaurant Mattes, closed last July.


The Need to Consider Pathological Gamblers
LEAD: The article, ''Legislators Weigh Raceway Proposal''  [ March 6 ] , outlines many of the ramifications of establishing betting parlors in our county.
One overlooked consequence of legitimizing and facilitating easy access to horse race betting is the possible increase in the number of pathological gamblers.


Molehills Can Be Mountains, Too
LEAD: The 50-odd piano pieces that Mendelssohn called ''Songs Without Words'' have been largely forgotten.
They are small and unprepossessing, while the symphonies of Mahler are large and unavoidable.
I suspect that every time Beethoven's Ninth takes a walk through our imagination, a miniature or two gets crushed underfoot.


COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: Corporate Relocation; Bright Lights, Big City: More Firms Staying Put
LEAD: OVER the past year New York City has been rattled by the corporate exodus of such giants as J. C. Penney &amp; Company and the threatened defections of such companies as NBC and Integrated Resources.


Palestinians Turn Ire on Collaborators
LEAD: Bicharra Qumsaya kneaded the black worry beads in his right hand as he scanned the faces of his neighbors crowded into the Greek Orthodox Church.

Review/Cabaret; An Accordion Summit
LEAD: At P.S. 122 on Thursday night, Danny Mydlack, a performance artist and accordionist, announced, ''I saw that in the future, everybody was walking around playing accordions,'' and for one night it was true.
Billy Swindler and Zeena Parkins (a.k.a. the B.Z. Squeezies) presented a variety show of accordion music from all over, their fourth Accordion Summit since 1984.


JACKSON WINS EASILY IN MICHIGAN IN SURPRISING SETBACK TO DUKAKIS

Review/Music; 3 Soviet Composers Are Focus of Festival
LEAD: In the haphazardly organized, passionately performed and poorly marketed pot-pourri that is Sarah Caldwell's Soviet-American music and dance festival Making Music Together, three composers stand out, and all three had programs devoted to their music on Friday.


Great Is Great, Old or New
LEAD: It must seem sometimes to lovers of classi-cal music that all the old verities are crumbling under their feet.
Critics pontificate about the fate of classical music, suggesting that it may not have a future in this age of pop and electronics and cultural upheaval.
Composers freight concert programs with unlistenable exercises in modernist rigor or cheesy crossover pastiches.


SCHOOL FOR HANDICAPPED WORKS MIRACLES OF HOPE
LEAD: The Feb. 21 article about the Little Village School did a pretty good job of portraying all handicapped children as being helpless and without any hope for a normal life.
While it started out as sounding positive with the title ''Here, Small Steps of Hope,'' by the time one was finished reading it, it seemed like a hopeless tale of woe.


World Weary
LEAD:  THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS  Starring Timothy Dalton (in photo),  Maryam d'Abo, Jeroen Krabbe, Joe Don  Baker, John Rhys-Davies, Art Malik,  Andreas Wisniewski, Thomas Wheatley,  Robert Brown.

Robert J. Weiss and Genell J. Subak-Sharpe insist that it is never too late to turn it into something more like a Caribbean cruise.


When White Water Isn't Enough
LEAD: I AM shooting down the Colorado River in gray rubber raft No. 612 with a mountainy boatman, a headphoned Upper West Sider and a Midwestern couple protected from the spray in see-through rain slickers, like potatoes in a Baggie.
The Upper West Sider is listening to the ''Ride of the Valkyries'' on a Walkman supplied by one of the guides on our 13-day, 235-mile voyage through the Grand Canyon; modern rivermen don't quite trust the crashing river to hold the interest of tourists with contemporary attention spans.

The Focal Point of Duke's Journey to the Final Four
LEAD: Out on the court, Danny Ferry had helped slice the net from the orange rim, and now he was searching the faces of Duke fans in a corner of Byrne Meadowlands Arena.


Bali
LEAD: To the Editor: Hotel management, architects, construction engineers and builders so often conspire, seemingly, to annoy hotel guests.
The Bali Sol, from which I am writing, is a magnificent example of a complete lack of understanding of a guest's needs.
Beautifully landscaped, the hotel fronts on the sea.

Home cooks will be busy preparing Passover seders on Friday and Saturday evenings or putting together Easter Sunday dinners.


ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS
LEAD: ''Objective'' explanations of the A.A. program are informative.
But ''gritty'' facts cannot communicate the essential truth of the program.
Bill Wilson and Bob Smith changed the world, not only for alcoholics, but for families and friends of alcoholics - Al-Anon and ACOA (Adult Children of Alcoholics) -gamblers (Gamblers Anonymous), drug addicts (Narcotics Anonymous), people with eating disorders (Overeaters Anonymous) and scores of others who find they need a program of recovery.


Yankees Are Settling on a Team Amid Relative Calm
LEAD: The first 37 days of Billy Martin's latest comeback have been eerily quiet, as if this were any other spring camp with any other team.
The fact that it is the Yankees - with their volatile owner and unpredictable manager - makes it unusual, as if this serene feeling simply cannot last.


Program Gives Support To Alzheimer's Victims
LEAD: Eight elderly men and women sat quietly in a semicircle, chopping vegetables for the borscht they were to eat for lunch, when one of them struck up a Yiddish tune made popular by the Andrews Sisters in the 1930's.

Verbatim; No Work, No Pay
LEAD: 'Exercising the right to strike inevitably risks economic hardship, but we are not inclined to hold that the right of association requires the Government to minimize that result by qualifying the striker for food stamps.' - Justice Byron R. White, writing for the majority in the Supreme Court's decision upholding a law that makes any household with a member on strike ineligible for food stamps.

An Intrastate Rivalry Gains a National Flair
LEAD: The sight was as hard to believe as the notion of a top-seeded team being removed from the national collegiate basketball tournament.

ORGANIZATION MAN: Victor E. Millar; Why Saatchi Chose a Stodgy Ad Chief
LEAD: MADISON AVENUE was alive with drama last week, as top executives at Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein defected from the shop's British parent, WPP Group P.L.C., and set up their own firm.

LEAD: INTRODUCED to Christianity through their native Celtic Church, absorbed into Roman Catholicism and transmuted through diktat to Anglicanism by King Henry VIII, the Welsh waited until the coming of the ironworks, coal mines and slate quarries late in the 18th century and throughout the 19th before molding Nonconformist denominations according to their own image and emerging with dramatic oratory and four-part harmony onto the religious center stage.


Should A Principal Have Been A Teacher?
LEAD: Only a few years ago, school administrators hailed alternate certification for teachers as one of the quantum leaps in education since Socrates, that recalcitrant Greek stonecutter, asked questions in the agora.


THE DANGEROUS MARQUIS DE SADE
LEAD: My wife is neither prudish nor anti-intellectual.
Nevertheless, upon reading one of the works of the Marquis de Sade, she reacted in a way that has come to be regarded as typical of the complacent bourgeois mentality: without saying a word, and having gone through about one-third of the book, she flung the slim volume into the trash can and went straight to the bookshelves to look for a substitute - the apposite word might be antidote - for her interrupted reading.


Three Crows Cause a Neighbor to Take Flights of Fancy
LEAD: They've been there all winter, cackling from their favorite tree-top turret.
I've usually ignored their presence, regarding the ubiquitous trio as a comforting sign that all is well in Larchmont, musing on the shrill diatribe hurled in my direction once they spy my plodding through the icy slush every morning.

C. W. Post's Life in Metaphor
LEAD: HOW does a small, bearded writer who looks like a Talmudic scholar, who grew up speaking Yiddish in a house ''just like the shtetl,'' find his way to writing about the sacred cows of American food and popular culture?
In Max Apple's books, food packages come alive in the capers of characters called Birdseye and C.


Duke Upsets Temple
LEAD: Duke's Alaa Abdelnaby and Temple's Ramon Rivas as Duke won the East Regional, 63-53.


English Trifle: Serious Dessert
LEAD: HEDGEHOG pudding, fruit creams, tansies, syllabubs, flummeries, junkets, trifles: not just one, but all of these fancifully named sweets would have adorned an English banquet table in the 18th century.
The English still love their desserts, even in this era of heightened calorie and cholesterol consciousness.


THE POLITICS OF CUOMO'S COLLEGE AID PLAN
LEAD: WITH audience after audience in recent months, Governor Cuomo has wasted little time getting to one of his favorite topics: Liberty Scholarships. ''It can catch on all over the U.S.,'' Mr.

HAWAIIANS' PATIENCE FOR IMPROVEMENTS IS WEARING THIN
LEAD: ONLY a few hundred people live in this hamlet on the southeastern coast of what Hawaiians call the Big Island.

AUTO MOTIVES
LEAD: NOT LONG AGO, DURING a country-house weekend, I was puzzled to see a successful businessman I know who looks like a wispier Woody Allen climb into a new Porsche 911.

THAT'S MY LINE
LEAD: THE FIRST COMMERCIAL TELEPHONE RESEMBLED A clunky box camera.
Designed in 1877 by Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas A. Watson, it cost what was then a princely sum: $20 a year in two advance installments.
In relative terms, telephones can now be just as pricey, but they also do much more.
Many function as secretaries, having built-in answering machines and memories that record the time of a call or automatically dial a series of preprogrammed numbers.


Princeton Sweeps
LEAD: The Princeton Tigers had more than a fair amount of success in foul weather today as they swept all their rowing races against Navy on the Severn River.


SUDDENLY, IT'S CHICAGO
LEAD: IF DANTE HAD SEEN THE TREASURY BOND PIT AT the Chicago Board of Trade, he would have added another circle to his vision of hell.
