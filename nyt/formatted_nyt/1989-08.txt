Spain
LEAD: To the Editor: After reading the articles on Spain (Travel, May 28), I would like to add several comments.

Smart Parent Quiz
LEAD: THIS is a parents' alert.
In a few weeks, your children will be back in school.
Which means homework.
And questions - lots of questions.
Many will be the kind of questions to which you know you once knew the answers, but for which your only response now will be a panicky expression (which you hope your child doesn't see) and either a mumbled response or a ''Sweetheart, why don't we ask (fill in the blank with name of spouse or grandparents - they told you, didn't they?).

LEAD:  TALENT.
By Howard and Susan Kaminsky. (Bantam, $18.95.)

Homesick for Hokum
LEAD: FOR the 15 years that I lived abroad as a foreign correspondent, I don't think I missed too much of American culture, at least not much highbrow or middlebrow stuff.

During the last few years I had access to videos.


Blaming the Medium for Its Message
LEAD: It is not entirely happen-stance that photographs are at the center of the stormy political dispute brought on by indirect Federal support of works by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano.

Breakaway Priest Wins Few Followers
LEAD: The breakaway effort by a black priest in Washington reflects a desire for assertion and recognition that has been prevalent among many black Roman Catholics in the last 20 years, black church members said.

Aeolians' Black Beaches, Fiery Peaks
LEAD: TO the ancients, they were the islands of wind and fire.

Question Of the Week; Was The Samuel Trade Good For Mets?

LEAD: When you hear the words ''Leica camera,'' what adjectives spring to mind?

FOOD: Western Flair; Come 'n' Get It
LEAD: There really is a home on the range, and it looks just like you've always imagined.
The cowboys sleep under the stars, they herd the cattle for branding and eat their meals around an open fire.
The range cook, almost always a cowboy, gets up long before dawn to start the day's meals.
It isn't an easy task: on the range, after all, there is no running water and no electricity - only a wood fire and 20 hungry cowboys.

LEAD: The reclusive octogenarian Victor Paz Estenssoro is to give up the presidency on Sunday after having turned Bolivia back from part of the revolutionary process he started in his middle years.


TAMING THE WEST
LEAD: The Western imprint on fashion is now much like a cattle brand - not too striking, but obvious enough to catch the eye.
For city dudes, that means accents: a fringed jacket with black leggings; a shearling coat with a pin-stripe suit; a pair of lizard boots with almost anything.
When in doubt about the mix, stride up to the mirror.


After Savings and Loan Rescue, Lawmakers Go Home

LEAD: Forty-six traders were indicted on charges that they repeatedly defrauded customers at Chicago's two commodity futures exchanges.

A Discerning Eye and a Democratic Outlook
LEAD: More than anyone else except, of course, Frank Lloyd Wright, Edgar Kaufmann Jr. was responsible for Fallingwater, perhaps the greatest house of the 20th century.

What is Samuel's on-base average?

Special Education For the Gifted Disabled
LEAD: We disagree with the anonymous ''special-education advocates'' who say there are ''no approved facilities that can academically challenge the small number of students who are both learning disabled and academically gifted'' (''Debate on Aiding Gifted Disabled Pupils,'' June 25).
At the Newgrange School, we are providing an academically challenging program for some of the intellectually gifted and above-average learning-disabled students in the central New Jersey area.

A Sculpture Show With Strong Messages
LEAD: THE sculpture festival at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on Staten Island is a lot more than the sum of its contents, which at last count was 42 works (excluding drawings) by 23 artists.

LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Japanese Artists Forgo Lotus Blossoms for Urban Blight
LEAD: It may have been unkind, but it was apparently not considered ridiculous when the writer V. S. Pritchett described Tokyo in 1962 as an ''anthill'' of a city.
Today, of course, Tokyo is exactly the capital one would expect in a country that dominates the international financial world, a sprawling, crazy-quilt metropolis resembling in parts New York and London and Hong


CAMPUS LIFE: Westminster; Visitation Policy Troubles Alumni And Local Church
LEAD: When Virginia Douds attended Westminster College in the early 1960's, life at the small, church-related school had changed little since its founding in 1852.

LEAD: Clothing inspired by Southern California's romanticized athletic style of life - surfing, water skiing, dirt bikes and skateboards - is appearing on main streets and in suburban malls, riding the wave of the beach mystique.


Duffel Coats Are Losing Their Old Utilitarian Image
LEAD: The duffel coat is moving up the fashion ladder.
This upwardly mobile style started as a rugged coat for country wear and bad weather, made in sturdy fabrics like loden cloth.
Leather toggles anchored it securely, a hood that buttoned under the chin kept out the wind, and the fabric was frequently water resistant so it would keep out the rain.


Review/Ballet; French Dancers Star in London Troupe's 'Napoli'
LEAD: Watching Patrick Armand's and Christine Camillo's terrific performance on Friday in August Bournonville's ''Napoli,'' one couldn't help wondering why so many visiting ballet companies put their best foot forward the second time around.

Ratings at the end of each item - satisfactory, good, very good, excellent and extraordinary - are followed by the date of original publication.


LIFE STYLE: Sunday Menu; A Zesty, Versatile Sauce
LEAD: Sesame noodles are the chop suey of the 80's.
Just about every takeout Chinese restaurant offers the dish.
It is the rich taste of the sesame, freshened with ginger and sweetened slightly, that appeals to us.
The taste is not unlike peanut butter.
It is easy to have a version of the sauce on hand to use whenever the mood for that flavor strikes.

The Folkloric and The Newfangled In Kenya
LEAD: Many Americans will forever think of African music as folk music.
Every year this becomes more of a mistake.
In urbanized Africa, untainted folk music has grown as quaint and artificially preserved as it is in the cities of the West.
The singing griots of Mali and elsewhere keep an oral folklore tradition alive, but

Jets Win Informal Affair
LEAD: The Giants and the Jets drew a crowd of 8,500, at $6 a head, to watch the National Football League teams scrimmage at Lehigh University's year-old Murray H. Goodman Stadium today.

Pros Who Know How to Get Rid of It All
LEAD: THE tag sale was not to begin until 10 A.M. but some anxious customers were parked along the road the night before and had slept in their cars.

Bad Cops in Namibia
LEAD: Namibia is proceeding bumpily on the road to elections on Nov. 1 that will lead in turn to a constitutional conference.
As part of a U.S.-brokered deal, South Africa has agreed to end its illegal control of a vast territory, which is good.
What's not so good is that South Africa is trying to tilt the vote to its political allies, using the roughhouse cops known as Koevoet.

THE JOYS OF VICTIMHOOD
LEAD: I can inform Joseph Epstein that there is nothing wrong with the conscience-and-guilt appeal in battling racism.
The civil-rights movement grasped in its early years - in the budding days of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People - that conscience and guilt are two sides of the same moral coin, and that any society claiming to be civilized must wrestle with both conscience and guilt when rectifying the wounds it creates.


Indictment of a Former Aide to Koch Could Impede Mayor's 4th-Term Bid

Unequal Contest
LEAD: Lisa Burke, 15 years old, and Molly Tolkoff, 14, of Brookline, Mass., play a rough and tough, competitive brand of ice hockey for the Brookline High School freshman team.

What is unusual is that their teammates are boys.
In two years, however, the girls won't be on the varsity team.

Disaster Leads to Safety on the High Seas
LEAD: Until 10 years ago, the fatalities in post-World War II sailboat races could be counted on four or five hands.

Mother Nature Will Provide
LEAD: Insofar as erosion on Long Island's South Shore, I say, ''Don't mess with Mother Nature!'' If one looks back, say to the day the Fire Island Lighthouse was built, the water was literally a stone's throw away.
There would be no Robert Moses State Park there today if it weren't for erosion.
What the sea took away in other places, it gave back on Fire Island.

Harmony Envelops the DAT
LEAD: The Last days of July profoundly altered the long-range outlook for audio.
Obstacles that had hitherto barred the import of digital audio tape (DAT) decks were suddenly removed by an unexpected agreement between record companies and the manufacturers of DAT equipment.

When Child's Play Isn't Fun
LEAD: ONE OF THE MOST worrisome reports a pediatrician can hear from a parent is that a child has lost all interest in favorite toys.

Outdoors; Treasures, but No Takers
LEAD: Experts are angling for an explanation of the results of the R. W. Oliver auction of antique and classic fishing tackle in Kennebunk, Me., last month.
Although the 755 lots in the auction sold for $436,000, exceeding the presale low estimate of their value by $45,785, buyers showed little interest in some choice items, among them two extremely valuable fly fishing reels.

Spain
LEAD: To the Editor: Regarding Joan Gould's article on the Great Mosque of Cordoba, which I visited many years ago: Each of the 850 pillars has a lead plate at the top.

Angels' Move to Top Blends Homers, E.R.A. and Shutouts
LEAD: The California Angels are one of the surprise teams of the season, but perhaps the most surprising aspect of their unexpected success has been the rare combination they have put together.

Question Of the Week; Was The Samuel Trade Good For Mets?
LEAD: It is not a question of whether Samuel is better than Dykstra or vice versa.
Since 1986, the Mets' management in its wisdom has gradually sent away Mitchell, Knight, Backman, Dykstra, Mazzilli and Wilson.
What is left is a fancy shell without a yolk.

Rome
LEAD: To the Editor: ''What's Doing in Rome'' (Travel, June 18) provided a good summary of what visitors can see and do, but one very important bit of advice was missing.

Tokyo Settles on a New Prime Minister

LEAD: A power failure early yesterday in Seaside Heights, a New Jersey island resort town, left tens of thousands of people in the dark on the boardwalk and in bars and dozens of others stranded on amusement park rides, including a Ferris wheel, the police said.


The S.A.T. Puzzle

LEAD: To the Editor:

A Life Taken In Princeton
LEAD: The article on the Sunday afternoon murder of an elderly Princeton woman (''A Life Taken, a Town's Illusion Lost,'' July 2), with its references to outsiders and drug addicts desperate for money, failed to mention that nothing was stolen and the murderer left the basement door locked, according to earlier reports.


IN THE REGION: Long Island; Recent Sales

Shame on the I.R.S.
LEAD: Of all the scandals now rattling the Washington bureaucracy, none touches more Americans than wrongdoing in the Internal Revenue Service.
Federal tax collectors regularly intrude on more citizens than any other arm of government.
Such huge power requires scrupulous honesty.
But a House subcommittee has spotlighted distressing laxity in staff supervision.


Myung Kang Weds Jonathan Huneke
LEAD: At St.
Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in New York, Myung Hee Kang, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

All in the Game
LEAD: Unlike most women, Ami Radunskya is partial to mathematics.
But then hers was not a typical woman's upbringing.


THE JOYS OF VICTIMHOOD
LEAD: Joseph Epstein says what some of us have been thinking.
As a bourgeois white male, I have become such a repository of condemnation and guilt from dozens of causes demanding liberation from my oppression that I surely qualify as a universal victimizer.
This condition makes me a victim as well, or, to use terminology fashionable in therapy chat, co-dependently addicted to guilt, and a survivor, eligible for a blame-support group.


WESTCHESTER GUIDE
LEAD: 'BARE' SHAKESPEARE


The Moment to Free All Hostages
LEAD: In the current brief respite from hostage-killing, President Bush may have an opportunity to arrange a swap of all hostages, and perhaps even to reach an understanding of sorts with states sponsoring terrorism.


Southwestern Dining and a Witty Decor
LEAD: ORDERING from the menu at the Coyote Cafe &amp; Saloon in South Norwalk is a little like treading gingerly through the Mojave Desert, trying to avoid mistakes and emerge with your taste buds intact.

LEAD: The struggling Baltimore Orioles suffered a setback yesterday when their slugging catcher, Mickey Tettleton, was placed on the 15-day disabled list.

Search to Resume for New Mail Site
LEAD: THE United States House of Representatives has approved a measure that will temporarily block construction of a Postal Service General Facility on land adjacent to the Westchester County Airport.


Rhode Island's Foursome of Wineries
LEAD: THERE is something a bit perverse about the idea of making wine in Rhode Island.
France and California seem more suited to the wine image.
Traditionally the work ethic has been reserved for woolen mills and whaling ships in New England.
But the contradiction is part of the allure of Rhode Island wines, even if the history behind it is a little fanciful:


Joan Hogan Wed to T. J. Gilman
LEAD: Joan Lorraine Hogan, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

The Rev.
Giles Dimock, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony.


A Tax By Any Other Name
LEAD: TRYING to make sense of the new taxes that went into effect on July 1 can be added to anyone's list of impossible jobs.
In their frenzy to avoid an income tax and the Governor's veto, our legislators constructed a mare's-nest that should give everybody something to complain about.


'El Coronel' Extended
LEAD: Two unscheduled performances of the play ''El Coronel No Tiene Quien Le Escriba'' (''No One Writes to the Colonel'') will be given at 3 and 8 P.M. today at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place.
The play is in Spanish, with English translation available by headphone.
Tickets are $15.


FASHION: On the Street; Short In Sleeve But Long In Style
LEAD: The current revival of the short- sleeved jacket makes so much sense one wonders what took it so long to come back.
Sticky summer days take most of the fun out of dressing up; in fact, they make it a chore.
Of course, there is always the option of dispensing with a jacket or blazer altogether, but that's not practical for women whose jobs, or personalities, require a touch of formality.


On Terraces, Living Above It All
LEAD: Even before the real-estate ads get around to mentioning the Panoramic Vu, the Wbfp, the Mble Bths, Wlkin Clst and Prewar Feeling, they announce - in large capital letters - that the living space for rent or sale has a TERR or ROOFTOP GDN.


INSIDE
LEAD:  Savings Banks Saved, Congress Heads Home


Sharing a Screen - Long Distance
LEAD: Ted has been in New York on business and his colleagues in Texas want to know how things are going.
They can call or write or send a facsimile or electronic mail to him.

Solutions to the Fat Problem
LEAD: WHAT do Americans worry about most?

A Painter of History Depicts Justices
LEAD: WHEN Alton Tobey met with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist last month, it was not to discuss legal issues.
Mr.
Tobey, the painter, had gone to Washington to complete his latest work, ''Equal Justice Under Law,'' a 6 1/2-by-9 1/2-foot mural depicting the 16 Chief Justices of the United States, from John Jay to Mr.


A Steady Observer for Trembling Moodus
LEAD: IN Moodus, they call her the Earthquake Lady.
Each time the ground moves, the windows of Cathy Wilson's house rattle and the stereo speakers that hang on the wall shake.
At times, loud thumps send ripples through her water bed, waking her at all hours of the night.
And sometimes, rumbling jackhammer-like noises from below send her 20 cats scattering in every direction.


Driving Mobile Billboards
LEAD: REGARDLESS of what we choose to do for our summer vacation, the majority of us will be traveling in our piece of the American dream: our cars.


Senator's Criticism of Israel Leads to Party Dispute
LEAD: In an unusual dispute in the Republican Party, Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has denounced Senator Bob Dole for criticizing a commando raid in which Israeli soldiers seized a Muslim cleric in Lebanon.


The Mortgage Is Paid Up. Hurrah?
LEAD: DO people burn the mortgage anymore?
Or even shred it?
I was ready to do either because I had reason to celebrate.
After 25 years, the last payment on the house was made.

Recasting City Council To Make Room for More Minority Voices

So are six of the eight members of the Board of Estimate, and three-quarters of the 35 members of the City


The Baltic Republics Are on the Road to Capitalist Socialism
LEAD: VISITORS to the three small Soviet republics bordering the Baltic Sea often remark that the only thing obviously Soviet about them is their poverty.
By culture, tradition and temperament they incline more west than east.


Of Life and Death
LEAD: It was supposed to be a test of the relationship between two people.
It became a test of will and survival.
Janet Culver and the man she had been dating, Nicholas Abbott, set sail July 13 from Bermuda to Long Island in a 37-foot sloop.

Culver, a 48-year-old executive secretary from Passaic, N.J., went along to see how she liked long-distance sailing and Mr.

LEAD: THE story behind ''On Board the Edna: Ebony,'' an exhibition of furniture at the Pritam &amp; Eames Gallery in East Hampton, has the ring of a 19th-century tale of derring-do: A 90-foot, two-masted schooner sailing on the other side of the world, brings home a cargo of exotic woods from an island in the South


Caddie Incident
LEAD: After shooting a second straight 77 and missing the cut at the St.

Getting High on Moral Indignation
LEAD: Short of unhooking the telephone, canceling the newspaper, taking an ax to the television set and hiding under the sofa, it would by now be impossible not to have heard of the pseudo-controversy about the photographs of the late Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano, the intervention of Senator Jesse Helms on the floor of the Senate and the possible effects of it all on the future of the National Endowment for the

Airport Parking
LEAD: To the Editor: Speaking of airport parking (Travel Advisory, June 25), some city agency should look into the parking fees at the city's airports.
Short-term parking costs $1 an hour; fair enough.
However, the minimum charge is $4.
How often have you spent four hours at the airport meeting a friend or seeing someone off?


Talking Your Way Out of College
LEAD: AS GUARDIANS of the portals of American education, college admissions officers are threatened with lawsuits, offered bribes by parents and nonplussed at the antics of applicants.

Spain
LEAD: To the Editor: The articles on Spain brought back many happy memories.
I want to suggest, however, that oranges on the trees lining the streets of Seville are unplucked for a simple reason: they are very sour.

They are, in fact, marmalade oranges.

NONFICTION

By Bill Starr. (Michael Kesend, $18.95.) Ty Cobb was not as good as his .367 career batting average, say the baseball computer analysts; if he were playing today he would hit only .289.

LEAD: When Frank Viola joined the Mets in their locker room in Busch Stadium, St.
Louis, last Tuesday afternoon, he and Ron Darling shook hands and smiled and exchanged pleasantries.

NOW, FOOD GIANTS FARM FISH, THREATENING SMALL GROWERS
LEAD: Food companies like Geo.
A.
Hormel &amp; Company and ConAgra Inc. have been processing farm-raised fish for years.

2 Years to Go For Shoemaker
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Suede, Often in Anything but Black, Is Riding High
LEAD: Forget the black leather motorcycle jacket and the tight black leather pants.
Think about a fringed suede jacket and suede jodhpurs or jeans.
That's the style that promises to lead the fashion pack this fall.


Time for the Jitters in Junk Bonds
LEAD: For years financial Cassandras have warned of the dangers of ''junk bonds.'' The rapidly expanding market for these low-rated, high-yield securities was hastily erected on a small, fragile and inadequate foundation, they said, and sooner or later many companies issuing the bonds would be unable to meet their debt payments, leaving bond holders without buyers when they wanted to sell.


Pool Long Closed to Blacks Ends Policy and Opens to All
LEAD: A swimming club that was closed to blacks for 34 years began admitting both blacks and whites today following complaints by a church group.


Harlem Curator Helps Redefine Photography
LEAD: The object is a fan, round with a long stem handle, of the type supplied by undertakers for promotional purposes and handed out free in churches.
On its surface, however, are pictures of children, birds and flowered hats, amid bits of fabric, keys and buttons, all remnants of childhood memories.

High Health Costs
LEAD: To the Editor:


Helping the Blind Enjoy the Show
LEAD: ''THE trapezoid shapes on stage are in various overlaying shades of brown.
At the top of the rear platform begins the base of a large cross.
This cross is made of Plexiglas and changes colors throughout the show to create shadows.
Rolling platforms come in on the left and on the right, representing various parts of the city.


From London, An ExplosionOf Dance Talent
LEAD: The London Festival Ballet, which from now on will be officially known as the English National Ballet, has been the surprise hit of the dance season.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: It's possible, of course, that the people with really big money and really big-bucks possessions would feel differently about what they'd most hate to lose or have stolen from them.
It's asking too much to believe that they would rather lose an important diamond ring than an unimportant ring with a four-generation background of nostalgia.


Review/Dance; A Merger and a View Of Future Pleasures
LEAD: The Lincoln Center Out-of-Doors festival has gotten off to a breezy, pretty start with a program by Nikolais and Louis Dance that was seen on Thursday night at the renovated Damrosch Park Band Shell.
The program was of particular interest for several reasons, among them the fact that Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis were honored by New York City on Tuesday, the official opening night, with a citation from Mayor Edward I.


Yes, Tony Spiridakis, You Can Go Home Again
LEAD: The line between art and life ran down 19th Street in the Astoria section of Queens.
Two old men sipped Greek coffee at the Perama Taverna.
Six little girls played dodge ball beneath lines of fluttering laundry.
Four boys pedaled home from the local swimming pool, shirtless and damp.
And Eugenia Spiridakis strolled toward the brick bungalow surrounded by cameras and cranes and lights to see how her son Tony's movie was going.


THE JOYS OF VICTIMHOOD
LEAD: I found Joseph Epstein's article a little disappointing.
Lots of mental-health research has showed that the mistreatment of children leads to lasting emotional damage, including feelings of worthlessness, helplessness and anger - i.e., the perception of oneself as a victim, even decades after the abuse has stopped.


Congress Frees Broadcasters to Restrain Themselves
LEAD: NOBODY has successfully defined what constitutes violence on television, but Congress wants the owners of broadcast and cable channels to show a lot less of it anyway.


Question Of the Week; Was The Samuel Trade Good For Mets?
LEAD: While Dykstra and Roger McDowell have truly flourished with Philadelphia, the most Samuel has done is to adopt the now familiar phlegmatic attitude and performing ability of the Mets.
Not exactly the spark we were all promised, huh?
RITU B. SHARMA  Massapequa, L.I.


Patronage Becomes Latest Hot Issue
LEAD: The perjury indictment Friday of a former mayoral aide who ran the Talent Bank for Mayor Edward I. Koch has made patronage - the doling out of city jobs to political allies and people they recommend - the latest hot issue in the campaign for mayor of New York.


Lyn and Karen Mandelbaum: Jewelry Designers
LEAD: Lyn is the tall one who does all the talking.
Karen is tiny and quiet, but you can't miss the fact that they are sisters.
Their features are similar, and both wear their dark-blond hair in a casual tousle.
They wear similar jewelry: elaborate drop earrings and multiple chains dripping charms and semiprecious stones.


A New Measure to Spur Private Housing
LEAD: A 450-UNIT condominium complex in the Bronx is expected to be the first project in New York City to be built under a new state law that broadens the use of city capital-budget funds in assisting housing development on private land.
The legislation was signed into law late last month by Gov.
Mario M.


WHAT'S DOING IN: Edinburgh
LEAD: Edinburgh's castle high on the rock has looked down on many a triumph and tragedy in the proud Scots capital, but every year since 1947, Britain's ''Second City'' steals the spotlight from London during the three weeks of the international festival.

The authority owns 318 projects of 178,000 apartments housing 570,000 people.


And Then There Was One
LEAD: In 1920, the third largest expenditure of South Carolina was payments to Confederate Army veterans and their widows.
This year it was $2,600, the annual payment that went last month to Daisy Cave of Sumter, who is believed to be 97 years old.
Mrs.
Cave is the last living widow of a Confederate veteran, a status she has held since Kate Nelms died in Corinth, Miss., in 1987.


How Teaching by Computer Played Out
LEAD: THE computer is becoming almost as common as the blackboard in the nation's classrooms, but most schools have yet to use it more inventively than they use the blackboard.


On Television: News, Lies and Videotape
LEAD: ''What do you mean Felix Bloch might not be guilty - I saw him do it on television.'' The conversation took place at the Denver airport, and it was with a top editor of a major metropolitan newspaper.
My friend, the editor, had heard the ABC News correspondent John McWethy report that the United States diplomat Felix S.


Foreign Oil Flows In, But the U.S. Can't Save Enough of It
LEAD: EVERY day, the United States adds 60,000 barrels to the Government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a sea of stored crude intended to cushion the effects of a disruption in the flow of imported oil.
But even as the reserve grows larger - 22.3 million barrels were added in the last year - the protection it offers shrinks.


Dispute on Jay Site Enters a New Phase
LEAD: A DEVELOPER and public officials have squared off again in their long battle to determine the future use of the developer's 23-acre property overlooking Long Island Sound.


Fertilizer Found to Rid Alaskan Shore of Oil

Lunatics and Lovers in Airy Comedy
LEAD: RICHARD DRESSER doesn't dawdle when he sets up a play.
In the Phoenix Theater Company's production of ''Alone at the Beach,'' five singles in their 30's have answered an ad for a summer share in the Hamptons - and each has been instantly accepted by George, the owner of the beach house.


22 Artists Participate In Bruce's 'Biennial'

Local Role in H.U.D. Hearings
LEAD: WHILE Joseph D. Monticciolo was administrator of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's New York regional office from 1981 to 1988, he frequently supported charity fund-raisers given in his honor.
On the surface it sounds worthy.


At the Metropolitan Opera, No News Is Worrying News
LEAD: This is the time of year when no news is the expected news from the Metropolitan Opera.
It's the summer doldrums, with the theater turned over to ballet rentals, the solo artists off traipsing the festival circuit, and everyone else enjoying a bit of blessed vacation relief.


V.A. Problem Is Not Lack of Money
LEAD: It is implied in your article that the only problem that the V.A. at Northport has is one of lack of funds.

Pierce Helped His Old Law Firm On H.U.D. Requests, Files Show
LEAD: Despite a pledge during his Senate confirmation hearings to ''sever'' his ties to his former New York law firm, Samuel R. Pierce Jr. regularly did personal favors for his former colleagues and interceded with subordinates in the Department of Housing and Urban Development on their behalf, documents from his office files show.


N.Y. Deli Southern Fried Style
LEAD: LOOKING UP from a corned beef and pastrami on rye, a weary traveler on Interstate 95 sees the Manhattan skyline; Broadway show tunes are in the air.

PASTIMES: Numismatics
LEAD: The equation, art plus government equals controversy is just as true today as it was in 1907 when Augustus Saint-Gaudens sought to redesign the $20 gold piece.


SHOCKING OYSTERS TO MAKE THEM GROW FASTER
LEAD: The increase in Government financing for aquacultural research is helping to improve the productivity and profitability of fish farming.
For instance, after ultraviolet light was shown in lab tests to stimulate spawning, some farmers began using it to control their production.


A Boom, As Nature Fails to Satisfy Demand
LEAD: Although fish have been farmed in this country for more than 30 years, aquaculture has never been what you would call a booming business.
Most of the entrepreneurs who dominate the business lack the resources and sophistication to bring their fish to the mass market.


Pollution: The Risks for Travelers
LEAD: SOME travelers think a change of scenery means a breath of fresh air, but if they're headed for Rio de Janeiro, Milan or Seoul - to name just a few cities - they are wrong.

'Workshop Sharecroppers'?
LEAD: To the Editor:


Runner at Half-Century Is Brought to Knees
LEAD: LAST year I turned 50, and it didn't bother me a bit.
I was in great shape.
I weighed 20 pounds less than when I got married 23 years before.
I had no gray hair, and from the front only a dignified receding at the temples was visible, suggesting, if anything, accumulating wisdom.
It was fun assuring friends that indeed I was 50, and hearing ''You sure don't look it,'' and ''I never would have guessed.

LEAD: Thousands of mourners defied armed South African police today to bury two student supporters of the African National Congress.
Later, the mourners clashed with the police after the officers tried to disperse them with tear gas.


Design: Western Flair; Rough and Ready
LEAD: The look is easily identifiable: Navajo blankets and beautifully handcrafted clay pots, rough-hewn furniture and cactus plants.
Indeed, Western artifacts are as much a part of the American design culture as Shaker or Colonial objects.
But rather than creating a total down-home environment, those who embrace this Western esthetic today tend to happily transplant elements of it in relatively small doses, placing just a few objects in modern settings.


Tara Powers Is a Bride
LEAD: At the Roman Catholic Church of Christ the King in New Vernon, N.J., Tara Evan Powers, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Flags, Symbols and Substance
LEAD: THIS is the way I remember the pledge to the flag as we used to give it in school.
We fifth graders would stand up and face the flag.
Right hand over heart we'd begin: ''I pledge allegiance to the flag...'' At that point we'd fling out the right arm, palm up, and continue, ''...of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

LEAD: The fashion photographs in MAN RAY: BAZAAR YEARS (Rizzoli, Cloth, $35; Paper, $19.95), shot for Harper's Bazaar between 1934 and 1942, meld commercialism with artistry of uncommon power.
These pictures, most of which have not been reproduced since their original publication, do more than display pretty models filling out fabrics and styles by such celebrated designers as Chanel, Schiaparelli and Mainbocher.


A Break From Questions for H.U.D. Employees

DINO C.E.
SCAROS  Cliffside Park, N.J.


Question Of the Week; Was The Samuel Trade Good For Mets?

Energy: Planning To Plan
LEAD: THE Energy Department last week held the first in a series of public hearings aimed at creating a national energy ''strategy'' by December 1990.

Twice-Told Tales Can Cast a Spell
LEAD: Scarlett O'Hara, weeping at the bottom of her grand, gauche staircase, vows, ''I'll find a way to get him back.
After all, tomorrow is another day!'' Margaret Mitchell's brilliant open ending has kept audiences arguing about Scarlett's resourcefulness for more than 50 years.
But if ''Gone With the Wind'' had first appeared in the sequel-mad summer of 1989, Scarlett's famous final line would hold the sure promise of ''Gone With the Wind II.

LEAD:  INTERNATIONAL/3-17


Cooperation Between Equals
LEAD: To the Editor:


Fund Follows a Tradition of Marian Anderson
LEAD: WHEN Marian Anderson received the $10,000 Philadelphia Award in the 1950's, she used the money to set up scholardhips for young singers. ''If some of these people have gone out and brought pleasure and satisfaction to publics of their own and if the scholarship helped them climb another rung on the way to their goal, I feel that the people who have listened to me ofer the years deserve the credit,'' she wrote in her autobiography.


So Far, Congress Comes Up Short on Ideas
LEAD: RARELY has a summer vacation been so eagerly awaited.
The 101st Congress broke for its August recess this weekend in a frustrated and uncertain mood.
Yes, it was jarred by ethics scandals and slowed by the transition to new leadership in both houses.
But with the leaders in place now and the turmoil receding, it is clear that some larger trouble is at work.


PASTIMES: Stamps
LEAD: Three recent books, handsomely produced and well illustrated, are each a good browse.
The first is ''The Guinness Book of Stamps,'' part of the Guinness Superlatives series.
Herein are found the biggest stamp and the smallest, the fastest delivery and the slowest, and a wealth of information on how and why stamps are produced.


A New Jerseyan on Patrol in a Royal Park
LEAD: THE royal parks of London - where history comes to life in palace gardens, on crisply clipped Victorian lawns and throughout unspoiled acres of former royal hunting grounds - have added to that history by establishing a link with the parks of Morris County.


Gehrig's Tribute Short, Not Sweet
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


It's a Bad Deal for the Model Debtor
LEAD: After months of intensive negotiations, the Brady Plan has finally produced the Mexican debt reduction agreement.
The accord, however, suffers from serious defects.
The package covers the Government's $54 billion in medium- and long-term loans out of the country's $70 billion in total bank debt.


FOUR ENTER HALL; SKINS BEAT BILLS
LEAD: Under a blistering sun in near-90-degree heat, Mel Blount, Terry Bradshaw, Art Shell and Willie Wood stood outside the the Pro Football Hall of Fame here, drenched in their suits.
But inside the hall, there was now a dry, sparkling, bronze bust of each.
In enshrinement ceremonies this morning, the four became part of the National Football


Artistry Is the Key to Copying 18th-Century Harpsichords
LEAD: CARL DUDASH spends months researching, designing and building each harpsichord he makes in his Norfolk studio.
But it is when he sits down at the keyboard to play that his face lights up, especially if the listener has never heard a fine harpsichord.


A Shipping Clerk Reaches the Top
LEAD: GOING from part-time shipping clerk to president takes a little more than luck, yet Ralph Frickel, the 34-year-old president of Benfield Electric International here, said he believes that simply being in the right place at the right time played an important part in his career.


Freedom Summer Legacies
LEAD: THERE are certain things I remember about our family's long summer trips from the land of Lincoln into the heart of Dixie.
I remember the blinding sun reflecting off the windshields of approaching cars; the heat blowing through the windows upon my parents, my brother, my sister and me, and the black .38 pistol my father packed in the glove compartment.


Raiding the Mets
LEAD: Mookie Wilson's departure from the New York Mets last week got scant attention - overshadowed, perhaps, by headlines celebrating the arrival from Minnesota of Frank Viola, a pitcher who's supposed to lift the team from its present doldrums.


Correction
LEAD: A front-page chart on July 30 about Americans who have no health insurance contained several errors.
A corrected version appears today on Page 26.


POSTINGS: Suit Over Non Sequitur; What's in a Digit?
LEAD: Some residents of West 62d Street are annoyed by the floating address of a new apartment house in their neighborhood and are suing to try to anchor the number before it causes more confusion among people doing business in or visiting the area.


Raising the Nets
LEAD: Would-be Michael Jordans on the playgrounds of Washington, D.C., and Alexandria, Va., call it slam-dunking, but local parks and recreation officials call it vandalism that destroys basketball rims.
As a result the bureaucrats have ordered the rims raised by six inches.
This could be a prime example of a well-intentioned reform with devastating side-effects.


Q and A
LEAD:  Reunion Planning


Filling Teachers With Energy
LEAD: WHEN Marsha Barber told one of her students that she was going to be employed by Amoco Corporation in Denver this summer, he asked her which gas station she would be working at.

Sizzling With Gaiety and Spice
LEAD: LARRY and the Redhead has taken Great Neck by storm.

Solving Two Problems With Artificial Reefs
LEAD: Perhaps it was a coincidence that articles on beach erosion (''Should the Natural Erosion of Fire Island Beaches Be Halted?) and overflowing landfills (''Ruling May Spur Recycling Efforts'') appeared in the same issue (July 9).
I believe a solution is at hand that would greatly alleviate both problems.


A Couple Becomes a Double In Cards at Summer Nationals

LEAD: IN three years of organizing trips for members of her museum, Mable M. MacDonald, the curator of costumes at the Richmondtown Restoration on Staten Island, has learned a great deal about bus tours.

Question Of the Week; Was The Samuel Trade Good For Mets?
LEAD: The Mets were in first place the day the trade was made and are now in fourth.
What good is Samuel's speed when he does not get on base?
He is hitting .230 since coming here while Dykstra is hitting .300 since going to the Phillies.
Roger McDowell has 12 saves and a 0.00 earned run average while the Met bullpen flounders.


How the Poles Suffer Price Increases for Their Own Good
LEAD: ''HE now takes milk, thin soups,''


Highlights Interrupt the Erratics-on-Avon
LEAD: Casual dress is the mode on stage at Stratford this summer.
Hamlet lounges around the castle at Elsinore in his pajamas, as if he had brought the wrong clothes home from Wittenberg.
Still wearing pajamas, he sleepwalks through ''To be or not to be,'' redirects the Players and enters Gertrude's bedchamber looking as if it were time for him to retire.


A Speck Between Sicily and Africa
LEAD: WANDERING around the lunar landscape of Pantelleria one recent weekend, I found myself struggling to understand why this tiny speck on the map between Sicily and Tunisia should show a lot more character than you would normally expect from an island just 9 miles long and 5 miles wide.


THE SUMMER REPORT: Endpaper; New Kid On Campus
LEAD: EVERY NOW AND THEN I come across articles in magazines or letters to the editor describing the problems that older people have with their spare time at retirement.
As a rule they go to Florida that first winter, then on to other parts of the nation, until they get the wanderlust out of their systems.

THE JOYS OF VICTIMHOOD
LEAD: Joseph Epstein wonders how Jesse Jackson can talk about victimhood when he's flying around the country in a fancy tailored suit.
Has Mr.
Epstein ever heard Mr.
Jackson speak?
He doesn't talk about being a victim.
Quite the contrary.
He tells young people: You can do it if you study, if you work, if you stay off drugs.


PASTIMES: Chess
LEAD: Some of the best, or at least most successful, opening variations look like desperation.
They look like what occurs to you at 4 o'clock some morning when you have racked your brain to figure out what to play against a solid defense that has so far mocked all attempts to find something - anything - wrong with it.


On Language; Ahead of the Vanguard
LEAD: THE ACTOR JACK Nicholson said three years ago that he would ''like to play people that haven't existed yet, a future something, a &gt;cusp character.'' So he wound up playing the Joker character in ''Batman,'' the movie based on the old comic book.

Using Capers as More Than Decorations
LEAD: CAPERS are much underused in our cooking; their function is mostly decorative.

Democrats, Too, Benefited From H.U.D. Programs
LEAD: As well-connected Republicans obtained millions of dollars in grants and subsidies from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the 1980's, Democrats were using their Congressional power and political ties to help friends and constituents benefit from many of the same H.U.D. programs, documents from the department and

ITALY: Where Connections Unlock the Till
LEAD: Censorship, in the form of a government official telling artists what they may or may not do, is not an issue in Italy.
But it hardly means that politics and the arts are not intertwined.
This is a country where party connections determine who becomes the doorkeeper at a government ministry, and the same principle applies to public funds for the arts.


CAMPUS LIFE: Illinois; Student Leaders Embroiled in Fight Over Elections
LEAD: The jobs don't pay anything, but the student political leaders at the University of Illinois are still fighting over them months after the elections were held in April.

FICTION
LEAD:  AUGUST HEAT.
By Beth Lordan. (Harper &amp; Row, $16.95.)

Canada

Search Methods Make a Difference In Picking VCR's
LEAD: To find a particular scene or segment on a video cassette, many viewers just run the tape back and and forth until they find the spot.
This method is slow, frustrating, rough on the tape and hard on the hardware.
With all the search and indexing devices available on modern VCR's, such haphazard hunting isn't necessary.


Golf Iron Ban Prompts Suit

Review/Music; 'Apollo' and 'Thamos,' A Pair of Mozart Rarities
LEAD: Even in the case of Mozart, the examination of child prodigies has an extra-musical air to it.
We shall never, for example, hear ''Apollo et Hyacinthus'' without mentally placing that asterisk beside it - ''the work of an 11-year old.'' It is Mozart's music in juxtaposition with Mozart's age that makes us gasp.


Correction
LEAD: An article last week about the closing of landfills quoted Mardythe DiPirro, Supervisor of the Town of Southampton, incorrectly.

Advertising Mail: People Really Want It
LEAD: In response to a letter in the Long Island Weekly of July 16, 1989, regarding receiving too much advertising mail, I realize the frustration with having to discard unwanted mail, especially with Long Island facing serious disposal problems.
The courts have held that censoring or otherwise refusing to deliver such mail is beyond the authority granted to the Postal Service by Congress.


IF YOU'RE THINKING OF LIVING IN: Lighthouse Hill
LEAD: MOST New Yorkers probably would be surprised to learn there are ''no hunting'' and ''no trapping'' signs within their city.

Question Of the Week; Has Dallas Green Done a Good Job?
LEAD: Last year Martin had one starter and no bullpen and had the team 15 games above .500.
Yes, he had Clark, Henderson and Winfield but don't forget Balboni and Hall have 70 r.b.i.
Barfield is doing just great, Kelly is getting on base, Sax counts for a lot, and the team is better off without Henderson.


THE SOUTH: Adventure Island - Tampa, Florida
LEAD: There are none of the standard amusement rides at Adventure Island in Tampa, Fla. - no roller coaster or Ferris wheel.
There is mostly just water.
But, oh, what they do with that water!


STREETSCAPES: The Czech Gymnastic Association Clubhouse; A 2-Story Survivor Amid Upper East Side High-Rises
LEAD: IT'S one of a vanishing species, an element of the ethnic Upper East Side that used to be the stronghold of Central and Eastern European nationalities.

BASEBALL: Notebook; The Pennant Dash: Who Has the Resources to Finish Strong?
LEAD: A year ago, the Mets ran away from the rest of the National League East with a six-week sprint.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Lower Fares, More Service - It Works
LEAD: There is no significant support for a return to the thoroughgoing cartelization and incompetent government management of the airline industry that was practiced before 1978.

Good Timbre Lies Flat
LEAD: Midsummer has settled over the audio scene, and all is seasonally indolent.
The customers are away, and what is heard in the shops is mostly the sound of the air-conditioner.
A similar lull pervades the manufacturing precincts of the trade as the workers head for the hills or the beaches.


Tracking Trains by Computer

THE WEST: Astroworld - Houston, Texas
LEAD: Houston is filled with people who pass Astroworld every day and don't go in.
It's just too familiar, sitting there in the middle of residential Houston.
Like New Yorkers and the Statue of Liberty, they think of Astroworld as something for someday or something for tourists.


Should Gym Be Required?
LEAD: In response to the Opinion page articles entitled ''Ending Required Gym: 2 Views'' (July 9): I believe that both views presented missed the point.
Has economics become the yardstick by which we measure whether we cancel gym class?
If so, our children and our future may be in serious trouble.


'People Are Living So Much Longer'
LEAD: FOR 43 years, Louise Bernstein, a social worker, has focused her energies on the elderly, working to create and improve services for older people in Fairfield County.

Chimney, Fireplace Checkup

LEAD: The cardigan sweater is enjoying a resurgence of popularity among young women who are adapting its simple, classic look in new contexts.


RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Skiing  Bittner Captures Slalom: Armin Bittner of West Germany clocked the fastest time in the first run and held on for the victory yesterday in a World Cup slalom race at the Australian resort of Thredbo.

Downpour Ties Up Trains, Buses and Planes
LEAD: With all the rain that New York has seen this year, it was going to take something close to a flash flood to startle the city.

LIFE STYLE: Sunday Brunch; Low-Fat, Low-Guilt Pasta
LEAD: In 1977, an event called Food Day was celebrated at the White House with a vegetarian meal.
It gave some Americans the idea that a meatless meal was not just for vegetarians.

LEAD: The Burmese opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has ended her hunger strike after assurances from the Government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, that her followers would not be subjected to ''inhuman interrogation,'' her husband told British officials today.


ILL, OR JUST THE BLAHS?
LEAD: Sorry, but I don't buy Bruce H. Dobkin's program of physical reconditioning and antidepressant therapy (Body and Mind: ''Ill, or Just the Blahs?'' July 16).

LEAD: When a group of people from Lynn, Mass. - led by a woman named Nan Heatherton - settled on Long Island's North Shore in the 1680's, one of their first tasks after planting crops was to erect a mill to grind their grain.

Children's Food; Test Cases
LEAD: My wife, Nancy, has a great job.
I know this because whenever she mentions it to people they always say, ''What a great job!'' She's a recipe-tester, and, well, it is a good job.
I mean, who's to complain about having to eat lobster and corn soup, shrimp in black bean sauce, tea-smoked duck breast, tuna carpaccio, chicken curry


Fish Decoys Aren't Fooling Collectors
LEAD: As a collectible, the fish decoy has surfaced.
It had been a popular item for several years, especially since the publication in 1986 of ''The Fish Decoy'' by Art, Brad and Scott Kimball (Aardvark).

'Are You O.K.?' Plan Is Good but Too Little
LEAD: The new ''Are You O.K.?
Program'' recently introduced in Ossining  [ ''Computerized Calls to Check on Elderly,'' July 23 ]  is a wonderful idea and has obviously proved itself in Iowa and elsewhere.
If the total price to monitor 1,500 elderly residents is less than $7,000, it is a wonderful bargain as well.

LEAD: Many in the arts say that government philistinism is unraveling a vibrant tapestry of artistic treasures and creativity.


CAMPUS LIFE: Fairfield; New Yearbooks With Live Action Vie for Honors

Behind a Corporate Courtship
LEAD: It was a merger that billed itself as a model of compatibility: Time-Warner, the company forged by combining Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc.
Synergy - that buzzword of mergers and acquisitions - would create a global media giant for the 21st century.

SOVIET UNION: Full-Frontal Glasnost Can Be Breathtaking
LEAD: The Soviet artist is so beholden to state subsidy, from quality of shelter to critical imprimatur, that the government's interference in the arts is a given.

This turn of events was followed by an unusual summer, which so far, has had more than an adequate amount of rainfall.
In ordinary seasons, lawns go dormant and turn brown at this time of year, but the grass has remained green.

The Beginning of Something Big
LEAD: A few years ago, a friend and I were ambling down the main street of an English town in Oxfordshire called Woodstock.
A microbus with Belgian plates pulled up, and the driver poked his head out the window to ask, ''Excuse me, do you know where ze festival was?'' I told him he was on the wrong side of the Atlantic; luckily for him, he drove off before I could add that I'd been at the festival.

New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  SHINING THROUGH, by Susan Isaacs. (Ballantine, $5.95.) Susan Isaacs' novel about a Wall Street secretary who becomes a spy in Nazi Germany is ''not just a 1940's period piece, but as close to a 1940's movie as a book can get,'' Anne Tolstoi Wallach said in The Book Review last year. ''It's like the kind of big, exciting movie we loved best then, in which someone pretty much like us takes incredible risks for unimpeachable motives and wins just what we wanted.

RADICAL TRANSFORMATIONS
LEAD: One would think their experiences might have humbled them, but David Horowitz and Peter Collier appear to be as certain as they once were that they possess the truth.

LEAD: A drive through the meandering back roads and clapboard villages of the Connecticut River Valley reveals an area rich in maritime history, largely undisturbed by the flow of time.

THE MIDWEST: Kings Island - Kings Island, Ohio
LEAD: Each year, millions of visitors brave the Beast at Kings Island in Ohio.

SHADES OF GRAY/GREY
LEAD: In discussing the usage of between and among, Mr.
Safire again offers his support for those teachers of grade-school English whose rules reach back to the conceit that only the Latinist has the right to prescribe the rules of English grammar.

It's Continental, but the Accent Is French

LEAD: Wild ocean surf, raging rapids and cascading waterfalls can be found in abundance throughout the Pacific Northwest, but the water temperature of these natural amenities can chill the nose off a snowman.

LEAD: IN the early 1920's, Stratford welcomed the City of Bridgeport's purchase of 800 acres on Lordship Point for an airport.

Inner (and Lesser) Circles
LEAD: WHEN George Bush was running for for President, he held a gathering in Farmington to which the faithful from around Connecticut were invited - provided they donated $1,000 to the cause.

'The Wizard of Oz,' in Toto
LEAD: The powerful hold THE WIZARD OF OZ exerts on adults and children alike owes much to the fact that it blends the best of two film worlds - children's movies and musicals - with an astonishing naturalness.

When the Neighbor Is a Theater With a Vision
LEAD: It is tempting to think of New York theater largely in terms of Broadway and Off Broadway.
But another aspect of theater has been quietly asserting itself; less glamorous, it aims to have deeper consequences.

THE WEST: Knott's Berry Farm - Buena Park, California
LEAD: When Cordelia Knott served her first chicken dinner to paying guests at Knott's Berry Farm in 1934, she and her husband, Walter, could not have realized that 55 years later guests would follow the dinner by being zipped from 0 to 55 miles an hour in Montezooma's Revenge or by piloting their own cockpit in the new XK-1 airplane ride.


A Palladian Journey in Vicenza
LEAD: PALLADIO himself could not have designed a better view of the subtle symmetry of his 16th-century Villa La Rotonda than from a four-seater plane high in the sky above the province of Vicenza in northeastern Italy.

Patricia Shiland: Unconventional Portraitist
LEAD: Patricia Shiland calls them ''miniature life-style portraits,'' and although the name may not immediately evoke an image, that's exactly what they are.
The finished product is framed, protected by glass and hung on a wall, but instead of a painting or drawing it's a three-dimensional portrayal of an individual in miniatures that reflect the person's style of living.


THE WAY I LIVE NOW
LEAD: As a writer and member of the gay community, and as a person diagnosed with AIDS, I am deeply ashamed of David Leavitt and his belated apology for not becoming involved in the fight against AIDS until now, until 1989, when ACT-UP became famous and it suddenly became fashionable to join the club (''The Way I Live Now,'' July 9).

Eastern Strikers Begin Lobbying Effort


Kid Stuff
LEAD: When Josh Baskin, the protagonist in the movie ''Big,'' moves into a sunny Manhattan loft, he fills it with all his favorite things.
There are video games and a jukebox, a trampoline and a bunk bed.

Indeed, Baskin, a 13-year-old lurking inside a man's body, put together a personal playland, one that has become the envy of teen-age

Question Of the Week; Has Dallas Green Done a Good Job?

When Congress Returns
LEAD: The nation's elected representatives left Washington last weekend in dire need of a vacation, which, by their own admission, they had done little to earn.
The first seven months of the 101st Congress were filled with distraction and turmoil, yielding little of substance.
Yet a demanding agenda looms ahead, and for that, a brief period of rest and reflection is surely in order.


Milestones for a Modern Teen-Ager
LEAD: WHEN the children were little, really little, we worried, as do all young parents, about their attaining the ''milestones'' that were set forth in the learned texts.

GOVERNMENTS, CENSORSHIP AND THE ARTS
LEAD: The relationships between governments and the arts around the world can be strikingly different from the American pattern, but some of the same underlying issues - appropriateness and scope of government financing, the way grants are given, censorship - are familiar.

NONFICTION
LEAD:  THE FRONTIER OF LOYALTY: Political Exiles in the Age of the Nation-State.
By Yossi Shain. (Wesleyan University, $25.95.) Political exiles are, arguably, the most passionately committed of all political dissidents.
Unlike members of a ''loyal opposition'' seeking political reform from within a nation's borders, or refugees who attempt to create a new life in a new country, political exiles are suspended in a kind of ideological limbo.


ISRAEL: Politics as Usual, But Not Over the Arts
LEAD: In Israel, where politics seems to be part of every issue, arts administrators and government officials say public support of the arts is free of political coloration.
That doesn't mean Israeli politicians are reluctant to criticize plays or exhibits that fail to suit their ideology.
And Israel does occasionally censor the arts, for what the government calls ''security reasons'' (though theater censorship has been abolished for a two-year trial period).

AIDS-Test Rules In 29 Countries

The list is based on inquiries sent to United States embassies around the world.

POSTINGS: Bursting the Seams; Chinatown Condos

Two Shows: One Works, the Other Bogs Down
LEAD: With only a few months remaining in the decade, it is high season for curators itching to define what the art of the 1980's has been about.

There's Far to Go In Cleaning Up The H.U.D. Mess

Why Not a Festival of Balanchine Discards?
LEAD: The works of George Balanchine are the treasures of the New York City Ballet.

Yet, our dance scene could be even richer in


'Titus Andronicus,' A Pursuit of Horror
LEAD: IT'S the summer of ''Titus Andronicus.''

Pursuing Pipe Organs of Note
LEAD: WHENEVER I find myself in a city for the first time, I find that the best way to start learning about its history is to visit its churches.

FASHION: At the Track; Saratoga Style: Breezy Cottons, Casual Linens
LEAD: The horse at right, Easy Goer, is a natural for leafy Saratoga, where the scene is relaxed, even at post time.
Though for Saratoga's clubhouse area and its tree-shaded paddocks, there is a dress code - dresses for women, jackets and ties preferred for men - no one seems to get too excited if it is occasionally ignored, as it was for the woman in the elegant white pants suit, center right.


Running the Little Man's Bank
LEAD: The blazing-hot heat was already rippling up from the pavement outside, as the cars began to swing into the pawnshop's lot and pieces of households emerged from trunks and back seats.


A Drive to Compete With Trucks

Many of the remaining 56 railroads were barely profitable.


Question Of the Week; Has Dallas Green Done a Good Job?
LEAD: Dallas Green appears to be totally unable to provide any off-the-field inspiration while his on-the-field managerial tactics are appalling.

MICHAEL HOWARD  Woodbury, L.I.

Let's Hear It for 14th Street!

LEAD:  STARS OF THE NEW CURFEW  By Ben Okri.  194 pp. New York: Viking. $17.95.


A Congenial Chinese Newcomer
LEAD: CHINESE restaurants have traditionally offered good value for families dining out.
Even today, when restaurant prices are steadily rising, this continues to be true, as Uncle Dai's, a new Chinese restaurant in downtown Stamford, demonstrates.
Uncle Dai's does not put a lot of emphasis on decor.
A few pictures, a lacquered screen masking flowers do their bit to dress up a long, drag storefront with red plastic chairs and booths and matching carpet.

Review/Music; Seattle Opera Pulls All the Stops Out On a New 'Meistersinger' Production
LEAD: New productions of ''Die Meistersinger'' remain scarce even in a time when radically rethought stagings of Wagner's most formidable music drama, the ''Ring,'' no longer qualify as rarities.
A comedy on a distinctly Wagnerian scale, it deals at marathon length in heavyweight, Breughel-like humor.
The work consumes more than five hours of an audience's time and can strain the resources of any opera company.


McPherson Stars for Eagles
LEAD: Don McPherson threw two fourth-quarter touchdown passes, giving the Philadelphia Eagles a 23-17 preseason victory over the Atlanta Falcons tonight.

Proof That All That Glitters Is Not Vulgar
LEAD: This city has always been a curious mix of gentility and toughness, of refinement and bluntness.

Tougher Reggae Puts Jamaica Back on the Map

Disagrees on Roots Of Dependency
LEAD: A statement by Sandra Bernabei  [ Westchester Q&amp;A, July 23 ]  requires a massive correction.

LEAD: ISRAELI reporters were laying in wait when Marrack Goulding, the United Nations special envoy in the hostage crisis, left Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's office last Tuesday.


No-Frill Lobster On Maine's Coast
LEAD: LOBSTER is a Maine cliche.
The jaunty dancing crustacean on the state's license plate leaves scant doubt in the matter.
Rare is the visitor who leaves without having savored the lobster's delicate flesh.
Still, there is snobbery, mainly in the contention that until you've had lobster at a bona fide lobster shack, you haven't really had Maine lobster at all.

THE MIDWEST: Cedar Point - Sandusky, Ohio
LEAD: ''When they hit the seat - that's when they chicken out.'' Jack T. Falfas, director of operations at Cedar Point, was describing how dozens of people wait nearly two hours on weekends to ride the theme park's newest roller coaster, the Magnum XL-200, only to bail out at the last minute.
What sends them scurrying down the exit ramp is the sight of the Magnum's first hill - a stomach-churning, 20-story incline followed by a sheer, 60-degree drop that hurtles riders through the coaster's dips and curves at 70 miles an hour.

Today's Hits Yearn for Old Times
LEAD: ''Tradition, honor, discipline, excellence:'' the motto of the fictional Welton Academy, carried on banners in the ceremonial opening scene of ''Dead Poets Society,'' reverberates softly through Peter Weir's misty-eyed prep school drama.
Periodically during a movie that reverently re-creates the cloistered atmosphere of a Vermont boarding school in the late 1950's, the camera draws back to admire the austere academy's snow-swept lawns, evoking a purer, more well-ordered era.

Some New Twists in Life Insurance
LEAD: Recent tax and demographic trends are changing the role of life insurance.

The Road to City Hall: A New York Voter's Guide
LEAD: WITH the Sept. 12 New York City primary fast approaching, the candidates must distinguish themselves in unusual municipal circumstances.

So far, 46 traders have been charged with trading practices that the Federal Government says systematically robbed the trading public on a major scale.

RADICAL TRANSFORMATIONS
LEAD: David Horowitz and Peter Collier are opportunists of the very worst type, and the attempt to legitimize them as ''born again'' is ludicrous.

He, and others of his ilk, shouldn't even be allowed near the place.

PASTIMES: Camera
LEAD: Last month I had a chance to test my action-stopping prowess at a day-long gathering of mountain bikers.

The League That Bans Tall Tales

WHEN NATURE PALES, THERE ARE MANSIONS, MUSIC AND ART
LEAD: There is a delightfully anomalous, pre-suburban quality to northeastern Westchester County.
Just beyond the bedroom communities of the early-and mid-20th century, and barely 50 miles from Manhattan, a surprising sense of rural gentility still reigns in such communities as Katonah and Bedford.
Along the heavily wooded country roads that string together a patchwork of still-quiet hamlets are such noteworthy house museums as Caramoor and the John Jay Homestead, not to mention the Katonah Gallery, that suggest a world far away in spirit from metropolitan New York, 1989.

The Americanization of Emily
LEAD: Two years ago, Emily Lloyd might have been dismissed as one of those minor storm systems that rattle the showbiz barometers, stir the moviegoing public and evaporate as suddenly and inexplicably as they arrived.
After all, she was only 16 and had appeared in a single low-budget film.
She'd played the brazen adolescent who scandalizes a sedate British seaside town with her sexual bravado in ''Wish You Were Here,'' and she'd done nothing else whatsoever.


George and the Yankee Doghouse

How to Survive an Unpaid Sabbatical
LEAD: THE sabbatical, once the exclusive perquisite of the academic community, has spread to the business world.

New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:  A MASCULINE ENDING, by Joan Smith. (Fawcett, $3.50.) A feminist professor visiting Paris to deliver a paper on the oppressive nature of masculine grammatical forms stumbles across the murder of an Oxford don.
This novel ''offers a pleasant look at the world of British academe,'' Newgate Callendar said in The Book Review last year.


Around the World With Peter Gabriel
LEAD: The world of popular music - indeed, the world of music in general - is filled these days with cross-cultural communication.
This communication can travel every which way, from Paul Simon's South African township jive to David Byrne's French-African dance music and Brazilian exotica to Youssou N'Dour's electric guitars.


WILLIE HORTON AND ME
LEAD: I am a black man.
I am a young black man, born, let's say, between Brown v.
Board of Education and the murders of Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman.
Or, in the years that followed the murder of Emmett Till, but before the murder of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.
I am one of the young black Americans Dr.
King sang of in his ''I Have A Dream'' speech: ''I have a dream that .

LEAD: The world intrudes on the habitues of a Colombian crossroads tavern in ''El Paso o Parabola del Camino'' (The Parable of the Path), and they learn in a brutal moment that they might be fortunate, after all, to live where ''news comes from other places,'' as the innkeeper says.

Zucchini With an Italian Accent
LEAD: ZUCCHINI can be a very boring vegetable.
As a child in England I remember how each year local gardeners would compete to grow the biggest, pointing with pride at specimens the size of a man's riding boot.

LEAD: New Jersey plans to expand and promote an unusual program that lends to the buyer of a dilapidated house the money to both buy and renovate it.

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. We are planning to install a new kitchen floor of vinyl tiles.
The existing floor is vinyl tile that still is well secured and has a smooth surface.

LIFE STYLE: Sunday Menu; Main-Dish Salads Escape The Tyranny of Mayonnaise

Getting a Refund From Eastern
LEAD: WHEN the air travelers' hall of fame is built, perhaps a special wall will be dedicated to the people who held Eastern Air Lines tickets in March.

A Red Sox Fan On Yankee Fans
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Interest in Reducing Accents Grows
LEAD: IT was like the scene from ''My Fair Lady'' in which Henry Higgins drilled Eliza Doolittle on proper diction.

A Neighborhood Wins in Capital's Drug War
LEAD: Green Hornet to Elevator Slim, Green Hornet to Elevator Slim.
Anything in sight?

Elevator Slim to Green Hornet.
Nothing.
Nothing.

Food; ACID ANGLES
LEAD: Just a generation ago, vinegar was considered little more than a modest kitchen staple, like baking powder or salt - and just about as interesting.
No one really knew much about it except that it came in two colors, red and white, and when mixed with oil, it made a basic salad dressing.


A Different View of ''Speed-the-Plow''
LEAD: SINCE David Mamet is a master provoker and a distinctive stylist, his depiction of women is one of the contemporary theater's more interestingly debatable issues.


Zucchini With an Italian Accent
LEAD: ZUCCHINI can be a very boring vegetable.
As a child in England I remember how each year local gardeners would compete to grow the biggest, pointing with pride at specimens the size of a man's riding boot.

Why China's Students Aren't Ready for the Masses
LEAD: CHINA is glorifying manual labor again, this time as a way to deal with troublesome young intellectuals.

A Chunk of Lava in the Sea
LEAD: ON the east end of one of Iceland's neighboring islands there is a vast hill.
It is a hill as dark as the melt of minerals in the earth's heart, and burns with all of their fires.

So Where Can You Find a Pool in Manhattan?
LEAD: Denise Courtney and Sheri Lawler have spent the morning dabbling their very tan toes and fingers in the water while their children slip, slide and splash all around them.

A COURAGE BORN OF BROKEN PROMISES
LEAD: In Michael Blumenthal's references to broken promises and shattered dreams, he seems to have bought the Cinderella story, hook, line and sinker (About Men: ''A Courage Born of Broken Promises,'' July 23).

Corrections
LEAD: Because of an editing error, the Prospects column last week, about the impact of the savings and loan bailout plan on interest rates, misstated Ralph Nader's assessment of the plan.

Kissinger and China
LEAD: Anyone still interested in the views of Henry Kissinger, who once exercised much power in this country, should look at a recent article of his in The Los Angeles Times.

A COURAGE BORN OF BROKEN PROMISES
LEAD: Almost all the single mothers I know have expressed the improbability of meeting a man who is as lovable, giving and generally delightful - in short, as nice to be around - as their children are.
Thus, Mr.
Blumenthal's arrogant pity for women, whom he describes as ''except for their children, alone,'' would be infuriating were it not so sadly conceived.

Young Musicians Sell Their Wares Door to Door
LEAD: The reward for winning this competition is playing in a bowling alley or a psychiatric ward - which might make Affiliate Artists seem a little declasse.

Jim Dale Taps a Bawdy Tradition for Inspiration
LEAD: Imagine you're a Malayan soldier in 1948.
You don't speak a word of English and you don't understand the war that strange Englishmen have come to fight.

LEAD: FOR three decades, California's Silicon Valley and the Route 128 area south of Boston have rivaled for leadership of the American computer revolution.

Delicate Silk Lingerie From Hong Kong
LEAD: BEFORE the Great Revolution, the Cultural Revolution and the Beijing Spring of 1989, Shanghai was China's most Westernized city, supplying foreigners and Chinese alike with the finest in handmade clothing.

UNNERVING ART

A Celebration To Touch the Heart Of a Tin Man
LEAD: It was less a tornado of attention than an outpouring of affection, but that befits the mellowness of a golden anniversary. ''The Wizard of Oz,'' the movie, turned 50 years old the other day, and locally the event did not lack for commemorations, promotions, parties, hoopla and happiness.


New York City's Housing Pace Slows
LEAD: AFTER a three-year construction surge in many of Manhattan's most expensive neighborhoods, the pace of residential development in New York City has slowed.
Its focus, moreover, is shifting to lower-cost housing, most of it in the other boroughs and much of it dependent on government support.


Review/Music; The Lyric's the Thing in Recital by Tenor
LEAD: Robert White's brief song recital at the Frick Collection Wednesday afternoon was as much about words as about the music that bore them along.

Even After Misfirings, Trident Is Well Liked
LEAD: DESPITE two test failures this year for the Trident 2, the $5.7 billion program to build the submarine-launched ballistic missiles seems likely to escape the sort of political repercussions that have dogged other new American strategic weapons.


Zucchini With an Italian Accent
LEAD: ZUCCHINI can be a very boring vegetable.
As a child in England I remember how each year local gardeners would compete to grow the biggest, pointing with pride at specimens the size of a man's riding boot.

LEAD:  The Imagination Under Attack


'Tailspin' Is Longer on Docu Than on Drama
LEAD: Like those cartoon characters who get shot, drowned, clobbered and blown up, only to reappear a second later ready to be demolished yet again, the docudrama is back.
Having done their stuff on Oliver North and Baby M., its practitioners are even now mucking about in the lives of Hedda Nussbaum and Joel Steinberg, of the fatal child-abuse case, and Robert Chambers and Jennifer Levin, of the Central Park strangling.


IRAN'S CHIEF SEEKS TO OUST HARD-LINER FROM NEW CABINET
LEAD: President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran sought the removal of his hard-line Interior Minister today in proposing a new Cabinet.

An Intrepid Opera House Ripe for Bigger Things

EASTERN GODS DANCE GAMELY IN THE WEST
LEAD: When the world is too much with us, there is a lot to be said for getting off the street and into a museum where we can move on the instant into another time, another place and another culture.
That was always one of the functions of a museum, and although it is now sometimes contested as wrongheaded, patronizing and imperialistic it still seems to have its untroubled adherents.


Hospice Care at Home: Another View
LEAD: Senator C. Louis Bassano probably never had to care for a terminally ill patient (''Helping With Hospice Benefits,'' Opinion page, July 23).
He probably never had to worry about soiled beds, adult diapers or the unreasonable demands of those who are about to die.

INSIDE
LEAD:  Dispute Over Computers


Choice of Slopes in South America
LEAD: IT'S no wonder, since the advent of Portillo as a premier ski resort in Chile, that North American skiers have looked longingly toward South America during the heat of the summer.
The Andes mountain range, running in a long spine down the western edge of South America in Argentina and Chile, has high peaks that extend well above the tree line.


Did the War on Poverty Fail?
LEAD: Twenty-five years ago today, several hundred Government officials and community leaders faced Lyndon B. Johnson as he signed into law the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, launching the ''war on poverty.'' Today, it is painfully clear that the war has not been won.


STREETSCAPES: The Penn Station Service Building; A 1908 Structure Survives A 'Monumental Act of Vandalism'
LEAD: THEY missed something and it is a rather big something.
When the Pennsylvania Railroad demolished Penn Station in 1964, it was described by The New York Times ''a monumental act of vandalism.'' Many New Yorkers and architectural historians still regret the loss of the station, and aficionados search the lower depths of the present station for remnants of the old one - handrails, elevator doors, lighting fixtures and the like.


Today, Manage the Yankees; Tomorrow, Worry.
LEAD: Bucky Dent, too easygoing to manage a major league team in the first place and one owned by George Steinbrenner in the second place?
Bucky Dent, too quiet to make the force of his decisions felt on veteran players?
Bucky Dent, too much Mr.
Nice Guy for this business?

Truffaut's Janine Comes at Last to the Screen
LEAD: When one thinks back to Francois Truffaut's classic first feature, ''The 400 Blows,'' the image that comes to mind is Antoine Doinel, the rebellious adolescent played by Jean-Pierre Leaud and based on the director's own difficult childhood.
What most filmgoers don't know, however, is that ''The 400 Blows'' was originally conceived with a dual focus, namely Antoine and a female counterpart named Janine.

Public Schools On Corporate Campuses
LEAD: Every Saturday morning for 10 weeks during the fall and spring, 60 seventh graders in Washington assemble for four hours to participate in the Saturday Academy.
Designed for bright students who nevertheless have a potential for dropping out, the program aims to keep them in school by building their self-esteem and skills through individualized instruction and reinforcement by the adults in their lives, who are required to accompany students to at least 6 of the 10 sessions.


Question Of the Week; Do Colleges Spend Too Much on Athletics?
LEAD: Colleges not only spend too much money on athletics, but also too much emotional capital as well.
A college president attending a football or basketball ame is a cliche; when was the last time you saw a president attending a classroom lecture?
What message does that send to students about what is important on campus?


LIFE STYLE: Sunday Outing; On the Trail, Harmony With Nature
LEAD: To anyone coming from the raucous streets of Manhattan, the quiet, domesticated aura at the Mohonk Mountain Preserve may seem surreal.


Going for Broke in Lebanon's Proxy War
LEAD: AS chaotic as Lebanon may have seemed to outsiders in the past 14 years, the civil war there actually followed certain unwritten rules.
What is new about the violence today is that those long-established rules are being shredded.
The political and military boundaries that no one had dared breach - call them ''red lines'' - have now been crossed, and the combatants are entering a new game whose rules are as undefined as its outcome.


The Shuttle
LEAD: To the Editor: Reading about Donald Trump's new airline colors and refurbishment (Travel Advisory, June 18), one could only conclude that the restroom ''burgundy porcelain sink, fake-marble vanities . . .'' were trompe l'oeil.
HERBERT WISE New York, N.Y.

That is, they consist of an inner framework of widely spaced, narrow pieces of lumber called studs, which are covered on each side by a layer of wall material like wallboard, plaster or thin paneling.


Nocturne in St.-Tropez
LEAD: ARRIVING in St.-Tropez in the late afternoon - my Pan Am flight was six hours late - I had to do something to fill up the time until the clubs opened.
So I dropped into the bar of the Byblos Hotel and spent several hours trying to decide whether to jump off the balcony.
Diving off this balcony into the Byblos pool is one of St.-Tropez's sacred rituals.


Review/Dance; Dayton Company Out-of-Doors
LEAD: The Dayton Contemporary Dance Company is an American dance institution.
Founded in 1968 by Jeraldyne Blunden, its current director, this immensely engaging modern dance company has managed, however, to stay young at heart.

All Sounds Blend in a Rich American Mainstream
LEAD: No less than European music from Bach through Brahms, American symphonic music in the 20th century has a mainstream.
The style is broad enough to take in jazz and 12-tone effects, the pastoral and the urban, optimism and (less frequently) melancholy, but it is grounded in tonality and independence of spirit.


Basketball Talent: Imports Are Up
LEAD: Six weeks from the opening of training camp, executives of the National Basketball Association find themselves with much more pressing concerns than trimming rookies and free agents from their rosters.
As a result of what Commissioner David Stern calls ''a shrinking basketball world,'' routine summer tasks have been overshadowed by an international chess game, played out in courtrooms, government agencies and basketball arenas around the globe.


Question Of the Week; Do Colleges Spend Too Much on Athletics?
LEAD: Colleges are supposed to prepare people for a lifetime career or job.
How long does a football career last?

First, Admit Past Policies Are Bankrupt
LEAD: The United States may have to rethink its relationship with Japan in the wake of that country's recent political upheavals.
Two separate scandals have brought down two Prime Ministers since the start of the year.
As a result, Japan now has a new Government and the Liberal Democratic Party is seriously weakened.


PASTIMES: Camera
LEAD: For much of the summer I've been taking pictures with two medium-speed color-print films that are new to the market this year.
One, Agfa's Agfacolor XRC 100, is a general-purpose film intended to appeal to a broad band of snapshooters.
The other, Kodak's Ektar 125, is a high-end ''premium'' film that

He was also the captain of the United States National Team from 1968 to 1975.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: It's difficult to believe, but there are actually people in this world who don't go around saying, even to themselves, ''Someday I'm going to learn French . . . take up skiing . . . fly a plane . . . read all the classics.'' These people don't carry over wishes, plans and good intentions from year to year.


FIGHTING HIS WAY TO THE TOP
LEAD: I ALWAYS LIKEN MY CAREER TO THAT SCENE IN 'ON the Waterfront,' '' says James Woods, an actor who doesn't sound or look anything like a young Marlon Brando.
Gaunt, tense, chain-smoking Marlboros and peering at his food through heavy black-framed glasses, he could be Sean Penn's smarter, older brother.

LEAD: Because of an editing error, an article on property auctions on June 18 failed to fully identify Steven L. Good, president of Sheldon Good &amp; Company, a Chicago real estate firm.


Back to Beauty Basics
LEAD: IT IS THE FASHION equivalent of cleaning house.
Women are tossing out the clutter, stripping away the superfluous and streamlining their beauty and fashion collections to the lean, spare essentials.
Take many of the new handbags.

Hot Dogs, History And Haddonfield
LEAD: The hot-dog vendor in Haddonfield was dead wrong when he stated in the Haddonfield Journal article on July 23 (''Vendor Wins Fight to Sell Hot Dogs on the Street'') that ''97 percent of the town is for me.''

Altbier, Dark Brew In Dusseldorf Pubs
LEAD: WHEN a bar sells an average of 4,000 glasses of beer on a weekday and up to three times that during the weekend, it must be doing something right.

FICTION
LEAD:  STRANGER AT THE GATE.
By Malcolm Bosse. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $19.95.) Indonesia in 1965 was a country in turmoil.
On one side was the P.K.I., the third-largest Communist Party in the world; on the other, the country's Muslim majority and its army.
Caught in the middle was the increasingly ill President Sukarno, who, in an attempt to maintain power and a semblance of order, was performing a delicate balancing act between opposing factions.

Pope Gives Cautious Praise to Polish Moves


Question Of the Week; Do Colleges Spend Too Much on Athletics?
LEAD: Being competitive is the name of the game in Corporate America and whether we like to admit it or not, college athletic departments operate off the same profit and loss statements as do the IBM's of the world.
I fear and often ridicule the big business philosophy that dominates college athletics today, but I'm also the first to rush home and overdose on the N.C.A.A.

Knicks' Pick Signs
LEAD: There aren't many experimental psychologists who can nail down a $110,000-a-year job before finishing graduate school, but then there aren't many such scholars who can hit the 3-point shot from the pro distance.


Recession? Maybe Yes, Maybe No
LEAD: SINCE the beginning of the year, there have been conflicting indicators about an approaching recession.
When inflation rose above a 5 percent annual rate, suggesting that the economy was overheating, the Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates and banks followed suit.
Interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy like housing, autombiles and some retail sales, slowed and inventories began to accumulate.


Life in Suburbia, as Artists Dream of It
LEAD: Ideally, suburbia is a place that has the benefits of both rural and city living but none of their drawbacks.
Books taking issue with that run from the socially scientific to the comic, and there are many of them.
But even more abundant is art about the subject, which invariably takes the form of caricature, be it an affectionately witty cartoon in The New Yorker or a cruel photograph by Diane

I'm Searching For Some Life
LEAD: EVERYDAY I'd walk home from elementary school and just before turning the corner to cross the ''big street,'' I'd peer up to the top window of a small framed house in Brooklyn where I'd see my grandmother and grandfather looking out the window.
Like two bookends on opposite sides of the small picture window, which I remember had a little stained glass jalousie that was broken, they'd look down and wave at me as

LEAD: To the Editor:


Design; PURE AND NOT SO SIMPLE
LEAD: It was a dilemma that even purists have trouble grappling with: whether to faithfully preserve a historic house in need of repairs by restoring it so it looks just the way it originally did, or to take a more practical tack and renovate the building to make it work for a family living in the 20th century.


ORIGINS OF CASUAL STYLE
LEAD: Today's new luxurious casual look has a special vocabulary of its own, reflecting its various historical roots.
Whether the style is full and features voluminous folds for warmth, or is sleekly tailored for sport, these articles of clothing often derive from the native dress of a specific culture.


Wine; THE BATTLE OF 1855
LEAD: The late Alexis Lichine spent much of his professional life arguing for a revision of the 1855 classification of the wines of Bordeaux.
He didn't succeed.
When he died, earlier this year, the 1855 classification remained much as it had always been - and probably will be for a long time to come.


PASTIMES: Numismatics
LEAD: In the early 1800's Britain was in no mood to trifle with trouble from its colonies.

From Young Veterans, Jazz as It Should Be
LEAD: ''Excellence'' is a word that changes its definition as often as a culture decides to change the way it looks at art - which is fairly often.
In jazz, in 1989, excellence is defined by precision, a playing out of classic ideas, and hard-driving swing.
Two of the young veterans on the New York scene, the 32-year-old tenor saxophonist Ralph Moore (who has worked with Horace Silver, J.


Story-Songs From Texas, Plain as Dirt

NONFICTION
LEAD:  BLOOD SEASON: Tyson and the World of Boxing.
By Phil Berger. (Morrow, $18.95.) For many people boxing is an odd sport, a gladiatorial throwback.

Santa's Off-Season Home
LEAD: EVERY parent who has ever been detoured by a whining child into a Story Book Village, a Frontier Land or a Dinosaur World, can blame it on one man: Julian Reiss, creator of Santa's Workshop.
Built in 1949, when Disneyland was but a gleam in Uncle Walt's eye, Santa's Workshop bills itself as the first theme park in the United States, and within a few years it was siphoning 12,000 people a day off the Adirondack roadways through its gingerbread portico.

LEAD: To the Editor:


In Danger of Losing Arms Race, Zimmer Revamps Rotation

Hours before, back in the stables, the animals were carefully cleaned, clipped and groomed.


Statewide Testing In Education
LEAD: I can appreciate, though not agree with, Donald J. Ryan's opinions about New Jersey state testing in education (Letters to the Editor, July 23).
What I can't appreciate and what I have to take issue with is the heightened vocabulary he uses in constructing a specious case for his position.

A COURAGE BORN OF BROKEN PROMISES
LEAD: Michael Blumenthal seems to be unaware that marriage is a two-way street.
Instead of praising these women for being so forgiving, he might advise them to look at how they, too, may have played a part in ''broken promises.'' The former husbands of these women may deserve better, too.
That's why they remarry - hoping.

Body and Mind; When Baby Has a Fever
LEAD: I'VE BEEN ON THE TELEPHONE now for two hours, trying to track down a 1-year-old boy with a positive blood culture.

A Hot Computer Technology Cools
LEAD: ''THE Network is the Computer'' is a slogan Sun Microsystems Inc. has used to emphasize the ability of its computer work stations to link up and communicate with other computers.

A Life-Saving AIDS Strategy
LEAD: The drug AZT, already used to treat people with overt symptoms of AIDS, has now also proved effective in delaying the onset of those symptoms.

Pirates Get Hatcher
LEAD: Stymied in his attempt to trade Glenn Wilson to the Houston Astros for Alan Ashby during the spring, General Manager Larry Doughty of the Pirates had to take another avenue, especially after Ashby was released by Houston in May.

Corrections
LEAD: An article last week about Union Carbide referred incompletely to the price history of the company's stock since the 1984 Bhopal accident.

Works in Progress; A Bath Every Century, Need It or Not
LEAD: PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRAC-tice.
Carnegie Hall, which turns 100 in 1991, predates the old joke - surely you've heard it: A tourist on the street asks, ''How do you get there?'' - but probably not by much.

RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Swimming  Another Record for Barrowman: An American, Mike Barrowman, broke the world record for the 200-meter breaststroke during today's qualifying heats at the Pan Pacific championships in Tokyo.

He had invented the girl more than 20 years before as Antoine Doinel's companion in ''The 400 Blows,'' but had cut the character from that film and carried her image to the end of his life.

What's Doing In Tulsa
LEAD: Tulsa, a young, sophisticated city on the edge of the prairie, revels in its heritage, the Indian, the cowboy, but predominantly in oil, which propelled it from cow town to ''oil capital of the world.'' Today, that boastful sobriquet is more nostalgia than fact.

LEAD: Yes!
Furthermore, he should be forced to do so.

Tennis Sanchez Vicario to Play Navratilova: Arantxa Sanchez Vicario fought back from a first-set loss and a 1-5 deficit in the second set yesterday to beat Gabriela Sabatini for the first time in eight career matches and advance to the final of the Player's Challenge tournament in Toronto. In the other semifinal match, top-seeded Martina Navratilova overpowered the Australian Anne Minter, 6-0, 6-2. Sanchez Vicario, a 17-year-old Spaniard, defeated the second-seeded Sabatini, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, winning six straight games in the second set. In only one of her previous matches with the Argentine had Sanchez Vicario managed to even win one set.

Refine RICO, Don't 'Reform' It
LEAD: Industry groups have demanded ''RICO Reform'' for several years.
So far, they haven't proved that the 1970 Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act needs more than fine-tuning.

History at the Tip of Long Island
LEAD: MONTAUK, at the eastern tip of Long Island's South Fork, 125 miles by highway from Manhattan, has the mystique of places at the end of the road.

Each time we washed this mildew off with a solution of one part bleach and three parts water; however, during the winter, the bricks turned a kind of whitish color, which would not wash off.
We don't know whether this loss of color is because of the bleach we used, or because of efflorescence of the bricks.

Making Nice to Your Stockbroker
LEAD: The current market rally may prompt more investors to call their stockbrokers for advice.
Unfortunately, most brokers pay serious attention to only a handful of clients, and chances are you are not one of them - even if you have $50,000 or more in securities.
Further, if you don't know how to work with a broker, even paying a steady flow of commissions won't necessarily win the broker's constant attention.

CHESS
LEAD: There is no problem playing against a man who has just published a book on an opening.

Operatic Rarities From a Farsighted Italian Label
LEAD: Even in a record industry newly energized by the CD revolution, the emergence of the Italian Nuova Era label as a potent force, particularly in the field of complete operas, counts as an extraordinary phenomenon.
While the company's rapid growth from modest beginnings in 1985 to its substantial catalogue today may stem from having the right manufacturing and distributing facilities at the right time, its success owes just as much to a combination of marketing skill, imagination and dedication.

The Dark Side of Schubert
LEAD: Many people who love music feel it is not only vulgar but pointless to pry into the lives of the great composers.

Four Seasons
LEAD: To the Editor:

Following Carlton
LEAD: For almost as long as he can remember, the St.
Louis Cardinal pitcher Joe Magrane has had one baseball dream.


Trucking
LEAD: To the Editor: I'm sure you know how dangerous it is on the highways when it rains.
Most of the hazard is created by trucks, which frequently go beyond the speed limit and throw a heavy spray onto passenger cars.
This is particularly troublesome when the trucks are large and their wheels high.
In a heavy storm, and at night, there can be long moments when visibility for drivers of smaller cars is almost nil.


DESIGN CAN'T HEAL, BUT IT SHOULDN'T MAKE YOU WORSE
LEAD: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the middle of Manhattan is one of the great medical and research institutions of the world.

Correction
LEAD: An article last Sunday about day-care centers misstated a requirement of a proposed zoning ordinance in Greenburgh.
In office districts, a center's building plans would need approval from the Planning Board, not the Zoning Board.


WHEN ALL THE STARS ARE GONE
LEAD: The very term ''street people'' seems to have taken on a life of its own: they seem almost a separate species, so wholly other, so seemingly lacking in context and individual history - so abstract.
Yet, Fred Waitzkin's article fights this violence of abstraction.
We are forced to confront a portrait of human suffering, in this case of mental illness and homelessness, that is both our society's shadow and reflection.

The Summer Book Helps Us Realize Summer's Promise
LEAD: NOW is the time for the summer lament.
Well, time nor tide, they say, waits for no man, and while this is undoubtedly true generally, it is especially true of summers present.

The great summer disappearing act.
Where did it go?


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Last summer, we installed a brick patio, but after a couple of months the patio developed mildew.
Each time we washed this mildew off with a solution of one part bleach and three parts water; however, during the winter, the bricks turned a kind of whitish color, which would not wash off.
We don't know whether this loss of color is because of the bleach we used, or because of efflorescence of the bricks.

LEAD: ''WHEN are you coming home this summer?'' asked my mother. ''Home'' is Lansing, Mich., and it has not really been my home for nearly 25 (Is that possible?) years.

We have been living in the 1980's for almost 10 years, yet they show no signs of ending.
Then there is the problem of how to judge a decade - especially one that is still happening.

Question of the Week; SHOULD STEINBRENNER SELL THE YANKS?
LEAD: The only nerve endings still functioning in George Steinbrenner are the ones attached to his pocketbook.
To successfully purge George would require Yankee fans to turn off their TV sets and boycott the season's remaining home games.
Considering the Yanks' cellar-dweller standing in the least competitive division race of recent memory, we all would sacrifice little.


Question of the Week; SHOULD STEINBRENNER SELL THE YANKS?
LEAD: Let us credit George Steinbrenner with genius for a particular time in the history of baseball: the 1970's, when free agency began.

County Hotels Initiate Training Classes
LEAD: IT is a familiar scenario: John Jones, businessman, walks confidently to the sun deck of a leading Westchester hotel and announces his arrival.
Instead of being handed a key, he receives an indifferent glance from the desk clerk, who informs him curtly that the hotel is completely full and, what's more, there is no record of a reservation for a John Jones.

Military Assumes Wider Role in Anti-Drug Effort
LEAD: After resisting such a role for years, the Defense Department is preparing to play a major part in combating the flow of drugs into the United States.
The change has been brought about in part by legislation last year giving the military a role in controlling drug traffic and in part by a change in attitude in the leadership at the


After Dream Season, Irish Return to the Strict Realities


Dispute at Coachlight Leads to Non-Union Cast
LEAD: AFTER the Aug. 13 performance of ''They're Playing Our Song'' at the Coachlight Dinner Theater in East Windsor, the eight-member cast quit the show.
Three day later, a new company took over in the Marvin Hamlisch-Neil Simon musical, which is scheduled to run through Sept. 17.
What sets the two casts apart is that the first consisted of members of Actors' Equity, the union of professional actors and stage managers; the new cast does not.


An Update on the Glorious Tomatoes of Yesteryear
LEAD: IT was the largest of all the tomatoes that survived the foraging raids of the deer on my garden this summer.

For the first time, they have emerged as distinct and varied worlds.


In an Inhospitable French Town, Muslims Struggle to Rebuild Their Mosque
LEAD: As his long white prayer robe hung limply in the late summer heat, Mohammed Mezgualdi stepped carefully over the chunks of concrete, broken timbers and shattered roof tiles.

ASHLEY SIMMONS  New York


THE ECSTASY OF GERARD MANLEY HOPKINS
LEAD: It is just 100 years since the death of Gerard Manley Hopkins, S.J., and about 60 years since I first read him.
Those were the days when to read ''Ulysses'' was to break the law.
Modernism was dangerous, and one of the marks of modernism was strangeness of language.
Hopkins, like James Joyce, had bizarre compound words like ''beadbonny'' and ''fallowboot-fellow''; he seemed to be dragging the Germanic roots of English out of freshly dug earth.


Watch Out Macy's, Here Comes Norstrom
LEAD: IT IS SUNDAY morning at the Bel Air Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles, and the subject of the Rev.
Carolyn A. Crawford's sermon is the Nordstrom department store chain.


Obscure No More: Espinoza Making Good Contact for Yanks
LEAD: The irony would probably be too much for Willie Randolph to tolerate.
In his 13 seasons with the Yankees, Randolph played second base next to 31 different players at shortstop, from Aguayo and Alomar to Zeber and Zuvella.
Bucky Dent served the longest of the horde (nearly six seasons), but after he departed in August 1982, 18 of those 31 players served as

The Bailout's Ripple Effect
LEAD: Washington's savings-and- loan bailout plan is intended to restore that industry to health.

LEAD:  Here are some notable releases of the last few months.


Still the Stones, but There's a Catch
LEAD: The Rolling Stones announce that they're back with the two triumphal chords that start ''Sad Sad Sad'' and open the album ''Steel Wheels'' (Columbia 45333; all three formats).
Those two syncopated chords, like a rock ''Amen,'' are the ones that kicked ''Jumping Jack Flash,'' ''Honky Tonk Women'' and ''Start Me Up'' into gear; they're a Stones trademark, and Keith Richards's guitar makes them sound brash, slick, edgy, poised, offhand, jubilant and nasty, all at once.


For School, Children Want Adult Styles
LEAD: Rough wear.
Animal prints.
Classics.
Quilted bags with chain-link handles.

Cost of Shoreham Put at $25,000 Each
LEAD: The outcome of the Shoreham controversy is a foregone conclusion.
Despite the apparently never-ending controversy, there is really no question about the ultimate outcome.
The old adage that ''money talks'' holds true in this case.
And the people of Long Island have ''voted'' with their pocketbooks.


Steering Your Way to a Car Vacation in the Soviet Union
LEAD: Even with the new openness, the Soviet Union is not the sort of place where you can jump in a car and drive off into the sunset.
You need to plan a car trip well ahead of time, and to stick to the itinerary you have agreed to.
All this is worth a trip with no parking meters or toll booths, some beautiful countryside, intriguing places and a sense of unmapped adventure.


A Movie Maker Preserves Those Who Preserved Him
LEAD: The first thing to know about Pierre Sauvage's documentary film ''Weapons of the Spirit,'' which tells the story of a small village in France where the lives of 5,000 Jews were saved in World War II, is that it is not the work of a dutiful child fulfilling, as the film maker put it, ''the deepest aspirations of his parents.

That is 13 stories higher than DeKalb


CAMERA

In Cambodia, an Ex-Leader Calls for End of Khmer Rouge
LEAD: A respected former Prime Minister of Cambodia, In Tam, who has returned here often from the United States to advise the Government, says he cannot understand why, in his view, the world demands a share of power for the Khmer Rouge, under whose rule more than a million Cambodians died.


Getting to the Top In the Caucasus
LEAD: THE man in the street, the man in the woods, even the top-notch travel agent have probably never heard of Europe's highest peak.

I lift my way against the unfamiliar demands of gravity, calling on joints and muscles that suddenly seem inflexible and weak.

Molding a Higher Cut of Bureaucrat WASHINGTON, Aug. 29 - How do you make a better bureaucrat?   It is a question that the Federal Government asks itself the way Detroit ponders how to make better cars. It is also the chief concern of the Federal Executive Institute, the Government's version of a General Motors-style executive training program.   For the last 21 years, the institute has taught trainees how to lift themselves above the faceless masses of the Federal bureaucracy.   At first glance, its program looks like any in the private sector. Some course titles even sound like they have been pulled out of a G.M. training guide: Leadership and Work Group Effectiveness, or Negotiation and Conflict.   Others in the institute's curriculum, like Foundations of American Constitutional Government and Great Presidents of the 20th Century, leave little doubt that the corporation under discussion is the Federal Government.   The most promising career bureaucrats, part of the Senior Executive Service, attend the four-week sessions at a converted hotel in Charlottesville, Va., two hours south of here. The $4,700 cost of a session is paid by the executive's respective agency.   Teachers drawn from universities and the public sector guide the students through 15 courses, designed primarily to teach them about their own potential for leadership and about the operation of the Federal Government. Stress on Critical Thinking    ''Our emphasis is less on moving papers than on critical thinking, problem-solving, strategic thinking for the Government with a large view,'' said Pamela Gwin, the institute's assistant director for academic programs. ''I see it as a broadening experience in the sense of making people aware of a broader environment, that their particular piece of their agency is no longer their whole world.''   Taught in a seminar setting, the classes employ a mixture of techniques: lectures, readings, group discussions, role-playing and examinations of case studies. Guest lecturers have included Frank C. Carlucci, the former Secretary of Defense, and the late William Bolger, the former Postmaster General.   Though some of the sessions may resemble aspects of programs in the private sector, the institute bears the unmistakable stamp of the Government. Not only is its thick guidebook devoid of glossy photographs, but also half of the book's pages are crammed with Federal rules and regulations.   Some of its lessons, too, would be of little value in the private sector, like that on page 27: Never Surprise Members at Home.   The guidebook instructs the trainees in the fine points of dealing with Congress, cautioning: ''Members of Congress anger very quickly when they are not notified in advance by the relevant agency of a grant awarded or denied to parties in their district, a government facility closed, or a contract signed with a district business.''   During free time, which is scarce, there are voluntary courses offered on quitting smoking, C.P.R. and wellness. There are also opportunities for volleyball and other exercise. ''The focus here is on the total executive,'' said Michael Hansen, the director of the institute, which is host to 68 executives at each of nine sessions during the year. ''Basically, the goal here is to get them to look at things they never had time to do.'' Administrator Looks Back    Adele Derby had just joined the Federal Government when she attended the institute in 1981. Now an associate administrator at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Ms. Derby said she learned much about her personality through tests she took and classes she attended there.   ''I get too intense,'' she said. ''If you get really intense about something trivial, it can turn people off.''   Ms. Derby, who is serving in her second one-year term as president of the institute's 2,400-member alumni association, said the institute helped her eliminate the negative influence she felt she was having on her department and her employees. ''When I came back, I felt I was a better manager for having gone there,'' she said.   James Colvard, then a director of a United States Naval laboratory, said a course on black history that he took at the institute in 1971 gave him a new understanding of his black employees. ''It gave you a perspective of being black,'' he said.   Mr. Colvard, now with Johns Hopkins University, said the course might have been in the back of his mind when he appointed the first black technical director of a Naval laboratory. ''He was qualified and a talented person,'' Mr. Colvard said of his choice, adding, ''I was probably more sensitive to needing to have role models at that level, so they could serve as role models to other black scientists in the Navy community.'' Overhaul and Renovation    The institute is now overhauling its curriculum, borrowing bits and pieces from the most current management techniques in the private sector, the university environment and other areas of the Government. The change, by all accounts, is long overdue. Though it opened in 1968 on the cutting edge of executive training programs, the institute, by the early 1980's, was mired in what many describe as an outdated, ''touchy-feely'' approach to management.   Its physical plant is also undergoing a much-needed renovation, at an expected cost of $4 million. The run-down, unkempt hotel that houses the institute has changed little since it was built in 1953. Though the renovation will tackle maintenance problems and make the dormitory-style bedrooms more livable, Mr. Hansen cautions that the work is being done with the taxpayer in mind.   ''It will not be a posh hotel,'' he said, ''but it will be very comfortable.''   With the growing perception that the Civil Service is having difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining highly skilled workers, the institute has the potential to restore some luster to the upper echelons of Government management, Ms. Gwin said.   ''That's part of our mission in a sense, because we talk about people doing good work and part of it is to have executives in the Government feel like executives,'' Ms. Gwin said. ''It gives them a sense of pride. It helps them feel sort of revitalized.''
