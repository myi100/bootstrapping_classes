Review/Music;   Rockabilly, Dangerously

GIRLS GROWING UP
LEAD: As the father of a 16-year-old daughter, I read with interest your article on the work being done by Carol Gilligan.

Toll in Timisoara Disputed
LEAD: A Government report said today that just 71 people died in Timisoara, where the December uprising against President Nicolae Ceausescu began, in contrast to initial estimates that put the number in the thousands.

For New Health Chief, More Problems Ahead

About Men;   What Do You Call An Aging Hoopster?
LEAD: EXCUSE ME, SIR, would you like to play a game with us?''


The Classic Conglomerate Wades Into the 90's
LEAD: It has a reputation for business aplomb, but Textron Inc., the Providence, R.I., conglomerate, is also a company that's found itself on the crest of trends.
Back in the early 1950's, when single-mindedness was American corporate gospel, Textron's founder, Royal Little, decided he needed a strategy to protect his cyclical textile business, so he invented the modern conglomerate.

Pastimes;   Bridge
LEAD: Tournament bridge is in general a democratic game with almost everyone permitted to play subject to occasional restrictions based on gender, age or, more frequently, past performance measured by some standard such as master points.


Currency;   Taking Mr. Greenspan in Stride
LEAD: The yen lost its punch this week, falling back to its level of 145 against the dollar.
As for the West German mark, it continued strong, but the dollar only moved down a little against it.
Suggestions from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that there was less chance of a recession seemed to have little impact.


Base Closings Seen as Opportunity Inside Problem
LEAD: Instead of just single-mindedly fighting the proposed closing of five Bay Area naval bases, local officials here are also considering how to acccomplish the historic task of converting to a peacetime economy with the least immediate pain and the most long-range promise.


The Debate On Self-Service Gas
LEAD: I find it comical, if not ludicrous, to read that safety is one of the factors in prohibiting self-service gas stations in New Jersey (''Debate on Self-Service Gas Lives On,'' Dec. 31).


LYNN HILL, CLIFFHANGER
LEAD: Congratulations on a superb article; Trip Gabriel's ''Cliffhanger'' (Dec. 31) just makes it for the end of a decade.
What fun to have the experience of climbing with Lynn Hill.
Her arrival in New Paltz marks a definite upswing for women climbers.
It's wonderful to be older and to have a younger woman as a role model.


On Great South Bay, Spring Comes in Its Own Sweet Time
LEAD: IT is a morning deep in February and the village dock on the Great South Bay is deserted except for seagulls.
Children are in school; adults are working.
The few baymen left are far out on the icy water.
They stand in flat wooden boats clawing at the bottom ooze with long, heavy tongs.
Silhouetted against the pale gray of sky and bay, their shoulders rock back and forth, back and forth, like men davening at the Western

Deadly Force
LEAD: Spend a night cruising the streets of the city in a patrol car, eyeing the crackheads and the hustlers, stopping for domestic disputes and suspicious characters, and by the time the sun comes up, there'll be one clear thought in your head: I'm glad I don't have this job.


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: Two years ago Paul Hecht and his wife, Lynn Vogt, built a log cabin in the Muskoka Lake region north of Toronto.
Theoretically, that is.
Actually, Ms.

VENTURERS
LEAD: YOUNG MAN started his career as a makeup artist at a cosmetics company.
He worked his way up and, with $80,000 from the sale of his house, moved to California to invent his own line.
He ordered $500,000 worth of makeup and other products from an Italian concern that supplies the leading cosmetics companies, but when they arrived, the lipstick cases were smashed and the foundation bottles were shattered.


Saturday's Heroes Should Unionize
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Chatham Association's Dues Structure
LEAD: The well-written article on the Chatham Fish and Game Protective Association (''From a Fish and Game Agency to a Friendly Social Center,'' Jan. 7) captured much of the flavor of the club, its past and present.

Redmen Lose Williams
LEAD: For St.
John's, a third consecutive Big East Conference loss was now the least of their problems.
A 7-point second-half lead that evaporated more because of their own failures than the success of their opponents had become a footnote.

POSTINGS: Park Slope South?;   20-Unit Condo for Brooklyn
LEAD: Even the most conscientious cartographers could not find Park Slope South on any map of Brooklyn.
But it exists in the minds of real estate brokers, according to William J. Kane, a Brooklyn developer, and who knows, it may catch on as the new more-marketable name for the area west of Greenwood Cemetery and east of Gowanus Bay that up to now has been called Sunset Park.

Managing;   When a Handshake Isn't Enough

NONFICTION
LEAD:
NIGHTMARE IN RED: The McCarthy Era in Perspective.
By Richard M. Fried. (Oxford University, $22.95.) ''There was far more to the 'McCarthy era' than Senator Joseph R. McCarthy,'' Richard M. Fried observes. ''Beset by Cold War anxieties, Americans developed an obsession with domestic communism that outran the actual threat and gnawed at the tissue of civil liberties.


At the Crash Scene, Disbelief, Disarray, Then Cooperation
LEAD: EMERGENCY teams in fire departments, hospitals and other agencies spend many hours every year reviewing disaster plans, but when Avianca Flight 52 crashed Jan. 25 in Cove Neck, with 158 passengers and crew members aboard, the same people who had drilled repeatedly and prepared continually for disasters were in disbelief that a catastrophe of that magnitude had actually occurred.


CAMBODIA FACTIONS SAID TO LINK ARMIES
LEAD: A memorandum prepared by the Cambodian Defense Ministry says the two non-Communist factions opposing the Phnom Penh Government are increasingly cooperating on the battlefield with their dominant ally, the Communist Khmer Rouge.


New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:
CROOKED HEARTS, by Robert Boswell. (Laurel/Dell, $9.95.) For the members of the Warren family of Yuma, Ariz., disappointment is such an expected part of life that they throw parties to celebrate their latest failures.
This novel is ''rich and vivid, an intriguingly busy view of the human adventure, the impossible family of man,'' Sharon Sheehe Stark said here in 1987.


World Markets
LEAD: While the Frankfurt Bund has been the focus of this year's excitement over investing in the future of Eastern Europe, the Vienna Bourse has quietly crept higher and higher, setting nine new record highs.

Mr. Bush, You Must Raise Taxes
LEAD: At the end of 1989, as chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, I issued a report that concluded our top economic policy priority in 1990 should be eliminating the Federal budget deficit.
Unfortunately, the budget proposed by President Bush last week breaks no new ground in dealing with the deficit.


Question Of the Week;   Should N.F.L. Drug Testing Be Revised?
LEAD: In reference to your call for opinions on National Football League drug testing policies: the men playing the games today are big boys.
They all know the risks and dangers of using and abusing drugs.
I think the league should butt out and leave the individual teams to decide their own policies.
Those teams with weak policies will end up out of the game because of weak, debilitated and jailed players.


Outside Distractions Affect U.S. Performance on Field And Leave Coach Angry
LEAD: Bob Gansler, the coach of the United States national soccer team, made it clear today that he was losing patience with players who have allowed peripheral issues, like contract disputes, to affect their preparation for the World Cup finals four months from now in Italy.


PARTNERS CHANGE, ALONG WITH ATTITUDES
LEAD: Dance, the most sheerly physical of all the performing arts, has long seemed to offer an inherent though changeable commentary on gender and sexuality.
With its wordless metaphoric power, dance is capable of suggesting as much if not more than the relationship of two people sharing a stage in an aria or as characters who talk of their love.


Fashion: On the Street;   You Can Dress Here For There
LEAD: More and more these winter days, hardy inhabitants of Manhattan's north country - way up there in the East 80's and 90's - are hearing the call of the wild.

One cross-section of this miscellany might go from the on-the-spot sketches of Robert Henri (lots of them) to the large, squared-up drawing for the mural ''Leisure and Architecture'' by Thomas Hart Benton; another might take in John Marin's impressionistic watercolor of the Seine, Edward Hopper's study of a steamship with sail rigging, a perfect pen and ink that must date from the artist's youth in

Editors' Note
LEAD: The Times today adopts the country name Romania, spelled with an o, in place of Rumania.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Dried Porcini Enters Some New Waters
LEAD: WHEN a friend presented me with a giant bag of dried porcini mushrooms he had bought at the Rome airport, duty free, I thought it would be years before I got around to finishing them.
But soon I found myself using them more and more often, in a variety of different ways.
These powerful mushrooms have a strong meaty flavor that is wonderful in sauces, stews and impromptu pasta dishes.


Corrections
LEAD: A credit line in the Arts and Leisure section on Jan. 21 with a picture of Dylan Thomas misidentified the photographer, and a correction today on page 32 of the section refers to her incorrectly.
She is Rollie McKenna.

Mendelssohn's Prophet Triumphs Anew
LEAD: If Handel's ''Messiah'' heralded the dawn of oratorio worship in England, and to a great degree in Victorian America, Felix Mendelssohn's ''Elijah'' struck high noon with its premiere at the Birmingham Festival in 1846.
Even in these more secular times, ''Elijah'' appeals, because its beauty and dramatic vitality ring true.


Jean F. Morris Plans to Marry


The Executive Computer;   'I'm Sorry; My Machine Doesn't Like Your Work'
LEAD: Managers at most companies are required to give performance evaluations to their workers on a regular basis, usually at least once a year.
While some executives say they enjoy the opportunity to provide thoughtful, constructive feedback that will help the worker meet clearly defined performance objectives, others - the majority, perhaps - would rather go to the dentist.

Ships of Mauritius: Models of Fine Craft
LEAD: EVEN as travelers streak from place to place in jets, many are drawn back to the days of journeys by sailing ship, of crashing storms and even mutinies.
On the island of Mauritius, about 530 miles east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, this fascination is created and sated by the island's popular craft of building model ships.


Lawyers' Objection Follows a Pattern
LEAD: I would like to thank the editor who brought us the funny story about the lawyers objecting to mandatory continuing education.
These are the same people who object to ''pro bono'' legal assistance in offices or courts.
These are the same people who have made it a requirement for other professionals to have continuing education so they can better serve the public.


GIRLS GROWING UP
LEAD: Thank you for the article on Carol Gilligan's work with adolescent girls.

TALKING: Landings;   Decorating Shared Areas

The President Looks On the Bright Side, And It's in Europe
LEAD: IT is hard for most of the world to focus these days on anything other than Europe, as events there tumble forward, pell-mell, and last week President Bush proved to be no exception.

McEnroe: Victim or Villain?
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


The Rush to One Germany Starts to Blur Europe's Map of Alliances
LEAD: IT had long been the common wisdom that East Germany could have no separate identity if stripped of Communism.
What nobody seemed to realize until recently, however, was just how true this was - how rapidly the ''first state of workers and peasants on German soil'' would disintegrate once freed of the Muscovite mold, how swiftly its citizens would reach out to the other Germany.


Campus Life: Berkeley;   'Squat or Rot': Students Fight Eviction Effort
LEAD: When the University Students Cooperative Association voted to close Barrington Hall last November, the 166 University of California students who lived there were given until Jan. 20 to move out.

On the Edge of the Universe With Hard Butter on Cold Toast
LEAD: THERE I was, trying to spread an intractable pat of butter across a rapidly disintegrating slice of toast when my wife suddenly asked across the breakfast table: ''Does the universe go on forever?'' Just like that, no warning, no preparation - metaphysics at 8:15 in the morning, and I hadn't even had my juice yet.


Seeking a Suitable Way To Approach the Issue of AIDS
LEAD: ''How do you deal with AIDS in pictures?'' asks Marvin Heiferman. ''Do you show those suffering from the disease, depress everyone, and let the audience gawk at a bunch of sick people?

Question Of the Week;   Should N.F.L. Drug Testing Be Revised?
LEAD: The drug-testing policy of the N.F.L. should not be under scrutiny here, but rather the journalistic ethics of WJLA radio in its irresponsible attempt for sensationalistic headlines during Super Bowl week.

GIRLS GROWING UP
LEAD: The Emma Willard School is a boarding school.

More Abuse in the Child Abuse Case
LEAD: After losing most of the notorious McMartin Preschool child abuse case, the Los Angeles prosecutor Lael Rubin whined that the defendants ''were lucky.'' The jury acquitted Peggy Buckey and her son, Ray, on 52 counts and deadlocked on 13 counts against the son.

Vincent Van Gogh, Meet Adam Smith
LEAD: No one really knows whether the unexpected return to the market of Vincent van Gogh's ''Irises,'' whose November 1987 auction price of $54 million made it the most expensive painting ever sold, will signal the end of the long bull market in contemporary and Impressionist masterpieces.
The value of art, unlike that of stocks or bonds or barrels of crude oil, is determined largely by psychology, and the factors that make one van

Review/Music;   Warsaw Philharmonic And Rising Piano Star

As it turned out, his affliction was, and is, obsessive collecting.


POSTINGS: Making Way for Metrotech;   Historic Homes on the Move

NOTABLE CD PLAYERS AND CASSETTE DECKS

Building a Bathtub Framework
LEAD: ENCLOSING a bathtub to give it the appearance of being set into a raised platform can transform a drab bathroom into a lavish one.

The Extra Dimension of 'Live' Recordings
LEAD: It is always good to be disabused of one's misapprehensions, and that is what has been happening to me with regard to the singing of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf.
Ms.
Schwarzkopf was the high priestess of the lieder recital from sometime around the early 1950's, when her collaboration with her husband and record producer Walter Legge entered its most fruitful phase, until her gradual retirement in the later 1970's.


Boston College Beats Seton Hall

Even the Governor was there.

LEAD: Eric Bogosian, the monologuist, writer, actor, is at a crossroads.
His new show, ''Sex, Drugs, Rock-and-Roll,'' which opens Off Broadway at the Orpheum Theater Thursday, will, he says, be his last solo performance.

Review/Dance;   Fagan's 'Easter Freeway'
LEAD: Garth Fagan's ''Easter Freeway Processional'' may well become a modern-dance classic.
The dance, created in 1983, offers a clear and vibrant look into Mr.

Mysterious emotion bubbles through its fairly formalistic surface.

Relative Values
LEAD: To the Editor:


FICTION
LEAD:
THREE-LEGGED HORSE.
By Ann Hood. (Bantam, Paper, $7.95.) Between the tuna casseroles, the women's magazines of yesteryear served up heart- and hearth-warming fiction.
The spirit of that fiction, nicely adapted to the changing social patterns of the 1980's, suffuses ''Three-Legged Horse,'' Ann Hood's third novel, in which Abby Nash comes belatedly of age, shedding her immaturity in the person of her footloose husband, Zach, for whom the summer of 1969 will never end.


In Hot Pursuit
LEAD: On Thursday night, with yesterday's start of the 24 Hours of Daytona sports car endurance race just a couple of days away, it seemed only natural that Al Unser Jr., his cousin, Robby Unser, and Raul Boesel of Brazil, all members of the Dauer racing team, would try to get in a little practice.

Evening Hours;   'Faust' Brings Out A Devilish Group
LEAD: Mephistopheles cavorted on stage Thursday night in a new Hal Prince production of Gounod's ''Faust'' at the Metropolitan Opera.

Up in the boxes, an enormous ruby-and-diamond butterfly that could have flown out of Marguerite's garden was perched on Judy Taubman's shoulder.


Review/Cabaret;   Marilyn Maye Returns
LEAD: Not every pop-jazz singer matures as gracefully as Marilyn Maye, who is appearing at Michael's Pub (211 East 55th Street) through Feb. 17.

Crying Wolf Over Swans
LEAD: THE caller was somewhat irate.
Dismissing me as an uninformed zealot bent on giving hunters a hard time, my critic came to the crux of her argument.


No Job
LEAD: Perhaps the most telling comment on the resignation last week of Peter A. Cohen (above) as chief executive of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. came from the marketplace: Shearson's stock went up.
The 43-year-old Mr.
Cohen, a Wall Street wunderkind who exemplified the hotshots of the 1980's, rode to glory on a market heated by the takeover boom and was ridden out of Shearson at least in part because a couple of his own takeover moves went sour.

SILVER STALLION.
By Ahn Junghyo. (Soho, $19.95.) After almost four decades, the Korean War has become a forgotten war.

Not All the Drama Is on the Stage
LEAD: BARCELONA is a city of innate theatricality.
It is a theatricality that springs, in large part, from the vivid contrasts that make Barcelona so engaging.
Laundry hangs from lines draped across apartment houses on some of the most cosmospolitan of streets.
A city plaza that bursts with Saturday night street-fair festivities, complete with the skulking ladrones and murmuring gitanos - petty thieves and gypsies - that tourists are warned about, is taken over by elderly men selling stamps and antique postcards on the sunny Sunday morning that follows.

Henry Salko of Stamford, Conn.


GIRLS GROWING UP
LEAD: I was raised in a traditional 1950's home, where I was taught that to be feminine was to be caring . . . as well as to be coy, deferring and, frankly, dishonest.
Women had to get by in life by being seductive or subtly manipulative.
Too seductive, however, and you were ''loose,'' too manipulative and you were a nag.


POSTINGS: 5th Time on the Block;   School for Sale
LEAD: Next Wednesday, for the fifth time in a decade, New York City will try to sell an old public school at 51st Street and First Avenue that refuses to stay sold.

LEAD: AS the Soviet Union strives to modernize its economy and match the performance of countries with free markets, it begins with an energy industry that missed the important events of the last 20 years.

When word got out that Mel Gibson's next role would be the lead in Franco Zeffirelli's film version of Shakespeare, it seemed bizarre casting at the very least.

LEAD: William Honan thoughtfully explored the current debate concerning the Field Museum's new exhibit program.

LEAD: For most of Dartmouth College's 4,000 undergraduates, a trip to the local barbershop or beauty salon is no big deal.

Spirits;   SINGLE-MINDED
LEAD: AT FIRST IT SOUNDEDJU like a question: ''You'll no leave Scotland without a stop at Edradour?'' Then it became a suggestion and ended up sounding suspiciously like a command.

LEAD: On a cool, damp and somewhat misty December afternoon, two men walk across a meadow, rifles in hand and hunting dogs baying as they advance toward a cluster of pine trees in pursuit of their prey.

Why the 'Prince of Pilots' Turned Producer
LEAD: Right next to the railroad tracks inside an old converted warehouse downtown, the sign tacked up to a rickety elevator says as much about the making of a new TV series as it does about the shaky lift up: ''Ride at Own Risk.
If you get stuck - don't panic.''

With Movies For Sale, What Of Rental?
LEAD: Out there in the video marts these days one sometimes gets the feeling that there are more movies for sale than for rent.

New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:
THE BRONTES: Charlotte Bronte and Her Family, by Rebecca Fraser. (Fawcett Columbine, $12.95.) This biography, in which the Bronte sisters are cast as 19th-century feminists, benefits especially from its portrait of Charlotte, Virginia Tiger said here last year. ''In its deft drawing of the adamantine circlet Victorian convention ringed round women's sphere, as well as in the elegance of its prose, the book is worthy of its subject.


When a Man's Condo Is Not His Castle
LEAD: THERE seems to be one in every suburban condominium development - the buyer who moves in full of promise and joy but who over the months begins to chafe under the restrictions imposed on owners.

AFTER 60 YEARS, A TRIANGLE IS ROUNDED OFF
LEAD: I am not sure whether the most remarkable thing about the recent competition to find a building to complete the Federal Triangle was the design that won, the design that lost, or the fact that the competition was held at all.
For this was like few architectural competitions in our time or any other: all entrants were required to produce a design in the spirit of the neo-classical architecture of the rest of the Federal Triangle, the vast complex of Federal offices between Pennsylvania Avenue, Constitution Avenue and 15th Street that was built in the late 1920's and early 1930's.

The State That's Wasting Welfare
LEAD: In lawmaking, as in any field, work expands to fill the time available.

It wasn't surprising - and it wasn't responsible.

Visions, Naive and Otherwise
LEAD: ''EXTRAORDINARY VISIONS'' is the current show at the Magenta Art Gallery, formerly Art by Design, in Rocky Hill.

Syosset Pondering End of Class Rank

Scottish plaids have been used as coats of arms, articles of clothing and patterns that decorate everything from mugs to jewelry boxes.The earliest tartans were thought to have been woven by the Celts before the year 1000.
Indeed, these plaids were so much a part of the Scottish culture that between 1746 and 1782, the British Parliament banned their wearing by anyone except the military, in an attempt to break up Scottish clans.

THE FRENCH CONNECTION
LEAD: As several critics note in PARIS 1889: American Artists at the Universal Exposition (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts/Abrams, $49.50), the only way to identify the American pavilion there was by the sign over the door.
The Americans' French-inspired academic paintings - Impressionism was in the air but not yet on the wall - featured Spanish musicians, Venetian gondoliers and an assortment of European shepherds.


Strawberry's Wife Meets Prosecutors
LEAD: Lisa Stawberry, wife of the Mets' outfielder, Darryl Strawberry, met with prosecutors Friday to discuss the domestic dispute that led to his arrest for on charges of threatening her with a gun.

Housebuster Takes Hutcheson as Rhythm Is 7th
LEAD: Housebuster staggered home to a three-length victory over Yonder today in the $94,645 Hutcheson Stakes at Gulfstream Park as Rhythm, last year's 2-year-old champion, finished a dismal seventh in his first start as a 3-year-old.


POSTINGS: Under Review in Westport;   Playhouse Plan
LEAD: The Westport Planning and Zoning Commission is considering a proposal from two Connecticut developers to buy the Westport Country Playhouse and incorporate it into a project that would include two small office buildings and a restaurant.


Lifestyle;   An Office Dog Is Usually A Relative of the Owner
LEAD: While the French may take their dogs out to dinner, some New Yorkers bring their dogs to the office.
Typically, the work place is within walking distance of home, since dogs (other than seeing-eye dogs or small dogs in carriers) are not allowed on public transportation.
And, too, these pet owners are often their own bosses, who can set their own rules.


For Valentine's Day, Dinner for Two
LEAD: IT is time to dust off the heart-shaped cookie cutters and cake molds again.
Valentine's Day is Wednesday.


Review/Dance;   Character Studies by Balanchine
LEAD: ''The Four Temperaments,'' one of George Balanchine's choreographic masterpieces, looked as marvelous as ever when the New York City Ballet offered it for the first time this season on Wednesday night at the New York State Theater.


Question Of the Week;   Who Is The N.B.A.'s Best Player?
LEAD: The best player is not Magic, Larry, Michael or Patrick.
If it were not for him, professional basketball would be filled with strike talks, lockouts, and empty arenas, to be viewed only on some regional cable network.

JEFFREY LOWENSTEIN

All About/The Tire Industry;   Decreasing Demand and Global Competition Propel Consolidation

Other Students, Other Voices
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


SAY GOODBYE TO THE STUFFED ELEPHANTS
LEAD: I finished a tour of Epcot Center a couple of weeks ago feeling angry because the place turned out to be a carnival (''Say Goodbye to the Stuffed Elephants,'' by William H. Honan, Jan. 14).
The technology that was used to show the exhibits was more instructive than the exhibits themselves.
The ''hands on'' displays for the kids were nothing more than video games.


WHATS DOING IN: Montreal
LEAD: While snowflakes whirl in the clear, cold air, Montrealers sweep in and out of tony St.-Denis Street shops and bistros.
On nearby St.
Laurent Street - where chic meets bargain basement - apple-cheeked youngsters toting hockey sticks and skates brush past shoppers as they scurry home before dark.
In Old Montreal, passengers sit under warm fur rugs as their horse-drawn caleche clacks over the cobblestone streets.


There's Nothing Going for Them But Talk
LEAD: The art of conversation has never been highly developed on television, that famously or infamously visual medium.
For the most part, tube talk takes the form of the kissy-kiss gush of show-biz personalities, dim jokes about the weather by local television hosts, early morning burblings about nothing at all.


What's in a Name?


Racing Slowly To Find A Niche
LEAD: When Bruno Weil was an exchange student in Fresno, Calif., in the 1960's, he made a three-point field goal that won the state championship for his high school football team.

Rogers Is Killingly's 4th Biggest Employer
LEAD: I enjoyed ''The View From Rogers: By Letting There Be Light, a Company Remains a Namesake'' (Jan. 14).
However, I would like to point out an inaccuracy in the article.
The article referred to Rogers as a village and at another point said that the Rogers Corporation was 'the town's largest and, in fact, only major employer.


Funds Should Flex Their Muscle
LEAD: Last month, two of the nation's largest pension funds took the unprecedented step of trying to confront the corporate lion in his den.

Campus Life: Brown;   A 20-Year Experiment Is Praised as a Success
LEAD: Brown's heralded 20-year experiment in student-guided undergraduate education was labeled a ''resounding success'' in an internal review published last week by the university.
But its author said the program, free of stated requirements and featuring a pass/fail grade option, has not worked for ''a small minority'' who need a curriculum made of sterner stuff.

Puerto Rican Carnival Masks
LEAD: EVERY February monsters run loose on the streets of the pastel town of Ponce, Puerto Rico.
They pick on women, children and pets, attacking with arms stretched over their heads trying to bop their victim with a dried pig's bladder.
From their demonic heads, horns sprout.
In fact, it seems the monsters have more horns every year.


Simmons 'Finally' Hits 40
LEAD: Lionel Simmons of La Salle scored a career-high 40 points yesterday and moved past Elvin Hayes into eighth place on the National Collegiate Athletic Association career scoring list.
He led the Explorers past Manhattan, 99-78, in a Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference game in the Bronx.


The Clock Is Ticking on David's Island Project
LEAD: THE release of a long-awaited Federal review of the proposed $1 billion residential complex on David's Island, a deserted 78-acre site off the coast of New Rochelle, has renewed a bitter public debate and set the stage for a final state study that will determine whether the project can proceed.


Copping a Plea

The Lure of Fordism, Jazz and 'Americanismus'
LEAD: ''Envisioning America'' at Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum may be the latest foray into the subject of art and American popular culture, but the works of Barbara Kruger, Jeff Koons, Cindy Sherman and Laurie Anderson are nowhere to be found.
Andy Warhol's name is never evoked.

For Not-Quite-Armchair Astronauts
LEAD: LATER, at the end of my three-day weekend at the Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala., I would be strapped into a plastic sphere hovering atop a two-story column of air, waiting to experience free fall for an almost imperceptible moment.
But the first order of business on Friday morning was group pictures.


A Musical That's Set In a Bronx Cemetery
LEAD: EARLY on in the American Stage Company's new musical, ''A Fine and Private Place,'' a big bologna descends from on high, landing on the stage with a thump.
Unless a show aspires to follow in the pratfalls of ''Sugar Babies'' or ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' it's not likely to live down a portentous moment like that.

LEAD: What bothered her more than anything was the pronunciation, Meagher pronounced Mahr not Meager.
She had been at the agency seven years and they still refused to pronounce her name correctly. ''Maureen Meager, a Dr.

New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: Before anyone else says it:yes, most holidays have been turned into commercial bonanzas; yes, it's the sentiment that counts; yes, gifts given at odd moments during the year, for no reason at all, are the tops.
Yes, yes and yes.
But it's still nice to get a valentine and if that valentine takes a special form, wouldn't one have to be mad, mad as in crazy, to object?


Style Makers;   John S. Winkleman, Architectural Artist
LEAD: He has been drawing since he was 10 years old, when his parents would take him out to dinner and talk about politics. ''I was bored,'' John S. Winkleman recalled, so he covered the restaurant's paper placemats with line drawings of houses and buildings.

What Mandela Wants: Statements at His '64 Trial
LEAD: The South African authorities have announced that Nelson Mandela will be freed today, giving him the opportunity to make his first statement in a public place in more than 25 years.

LEAD: The Puerto Rican on the American mainland.
Who is he?
What does he want to be?
Identity crisis, the perennial puzzlement of the newcomer in the city, is the issue poignantly and melodramatically at hand in Richard V. Irizarry's ''Ariano,'' now playing at the estimable Puerto Rican Traveling Theater.


Taxes Give the Democrats One More Identity Problem
LEAD: WHEN Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan proposed cutting the Social Security tax, some party consultants seized on the idea as a brilliant political weapon.
Here was a Democratic tax cut for the 1990's that was fairer than the Republican tax cuts of the 1980's.
At the same time, the proposal revealed two facts of Republican fiscal policy: that cuts in the progressive income tax had effectively been paid for by increases in the regressive payroll tax, and that the proceeds were being spent like any other revenues rather than being socked away.

LEAD: The rift between the Rev.

Question Of the Week;   Who Is The N.B.A.'s Best Player?

Legacy From Photography's Mount Olympus
LEAD: Of the score or more museum exhibitions organized in ob-servance of 150 years of photography, none has been more eagerly awaited than ''Photography Until Now,'' which opens next Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art.

After the Run of Rich Deals, Risk in Arbitrage is Back
LEAD: At a time when a shaky ''junk bond'' market and a paucity of takeover deals have sent many Wall Street arbitragers to the sidelines, a few stalwarts are still hanging in.

LEAD: Language is reaffirming itself in the American theater, and the harbingers are Mac Wellman, Eric Overmyer and David Ives.

Image Problems: A Director's Specialty
LEAD: As we move into the 1990'S, the increasingly familiar video screen has assumed many functions.

The fine lines among these possibilities have been fascinating the Canadian director Atom Egoyan since be began making movies 10 years ago.


Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Our house is more than 60 years old and has more than one roof on it.
The last roof has been on about 20 years, and the last time a contractor checked it he said there were many more years of wear left.

PERSPECTIVES: Two-Families in Bushwick;   Widening the Paths to For-Sale Housing
LEAD: IN the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, where other news lately has been grim, something of a home-building resurgence is under way.
It has demonstrated that even in one of the poorest sections of the city there are people of moderate means willing and able to invest thousands of their own dollars in a new house.


A HIGHLAND FLING
LEAD: True tartans are the stuff of drama and legend, conjuring up swashbuckling tales of Scots wearing kilts woven in the plaid of their clan.

That Rare Vocal Bird, a True Verdi Mezzo
LEAD: ''I've got this big mama with a big voice'' was how the stage director Lou Galtiero described a student in his class at the Manhattan School of Music to the artist's manager, Elizabeth Crittenden.

Holiday Displays On Public Property
LEAD: The holiday season is behind us, but the issue of Christmas and Hanukkah displays on public property persists in public debate in Teaneck.
Why?

PASTIMES: Chess
LEAD: The early 19th century was the epoch of untrammeled attacking play, the time for slugging it out with an opponent who was just as intent on slugging it out with you.

The man who dominated the chess world from 1866 to 1894 brought a sophisticated grasp to defensive play that had never been seen before.

Volvo 740 Puts On A New Face in '90
LEAD: A lot of people seem to be saying that cars look alike these days, and that may be true.

LEAD: American University students awoke to find anti-Semitic graffiti spray-painted on the main gate and a residence hall last Thursday morning.

The Needs Of the Retarded
LEAD: I am pleased that Walter McCarthy, in his article ''What the Retarded Need'' (Jan. 7), brought up the topic of social skills for the retarded.
Interestingly, it is an area that does receive a great deal of emphasis in schools and agencies, while being an area that the public does not hear much about.


Help From the Bar
LEAD: One small beleaguered corner of government where public services may actually improve during New York City's looming budget crisis is the Human Rights Commission.

Mood Swings Set the Tone On the Street
LEAD: If psychiatrists, rather than economists, were the specialists that Wall Street relied upon, they might have a simple explanation for the way the stock and bond markets have moved this year. ''Manic-depressive'' would be the diagnosis.
One moment all is well; the next brings obvious and overwhelming reasons for fear.


Board Tries Balancing Act On Yonkers Sludge Plant
LEAD: THE Board of Legislators seemed to solve one problem while compounding another last week when it approved the construction of an $18.9 million sludge-drying plant in the Ludlow Park section of Yonkers.

The Rangers, still reeling from the turnaround that transformed a near 2-1 triumph into a clear 3-2 disaster against the Sabres 12 hours earlier, sat in an airplane in Buffalo yesterday morning.
They were strapped into their seats through a long delay and locked into the mind's unsightly replay of the collapse the night before.

Peace Before Power
LEAD: The principle is settled.
West Germany will absorb East Germany, probably this year.
Bonn's December elections will be for a Reichskanzler, not just leader of the Federal Republic but of all Germany.
Whether East Germans participate remains to be decided.
But they will have a big influence.
The electorate will know it is choosing the government for a united country.

2 Public Relations Styles Clash in Battle of Trumps
LEAD: One is a mild-mannered man who once had a client bring a live elephant to the steps of City Hall, but who has since more often relied on his skills as a conciliator to build a large public relations firm and a reputation as a man you need to know in New York City.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Coping: With Photographic Red Eye
LEAD: Of all the things that can go wrong in a snapshot, few are more disconcerting than the phenomenon of red eye.
It leaves friends and family looking like ghouls, their eyes glowing an unearthly shade of crimson.
While over the last 10 years camera manufacturers have eliminated virtually all the other plagues that can ruin photographs, red eye has remained an all-too-common flaw.


Corrections
LEAD: Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about the bombing of a refugee settlement in El Salvador misidentified the group that confirmed reports of the attack.
It was the Salvadoran Red Cross, not the International Committee of the Red Cross.


What's Blocking the Thrift Bailout?
LEAD: The meter keeps ticking on the savings-and-loan crisis.
Insolvent thrifts are piling up losses at a rate of $6 million a day.
Or maybe it's $14 million.

It's hard to pin down a firm number.
It's even harder to pin down who's running the rescue effort.

LEAD: The Rev.
John Mario, a priest whose credentials have been questioned in recent weeks, was dismissed yesterday as an official with the New York City Human Resources Administration.


Bridge
LEAD: Few players realize that there are considerable opportunities for effective deceptive plays in the trump suit.
There is, for example, a whole family of doubleton tenaces: jack-nine, queen-ten, king-jack and ace-queen.
In each case it is sometimes productive to play the higher honor unnecessarily, and lead the declarer down a tempting path.


Reagan Testifies in the Poindexter Case

CHRONICLE
LEAD: ANDREI SERBAN is savoring a sweet moment: the Romanian Government has offered him the directorship of either its National Theater or the Romanian State Opera House in Bucharest.


Beliefs
LEAD: After three decades of sustained interfaith dialogue among America's Roman Catholics, Protestants and Jews, the borders of most religious groups are largely undefended, and no one is massing troops along them.
Compared with the bitter Catholic-Protestant conflicts of, say, the 1950's, today's occasional quarrels look more like customs disputes than full-scale belligerency.

The Quest for Quiet Takes On An Urgent Note
LEAD: IT would be nice to say I became an anti-noise activist to make Larchmont a quieter place for everyone; but in fact it was to make Larchmont a quieter place for me.

Boxing: Same Old Stories, New Twists
LEAD: When Don Skene was a boxing reporter for The New York Herald Tribune, his sense of perspective was so broad he never entered a fight club without saying, ''Things were never like this when we fought on barges.'' Unfortunately, the late Mr.

Nothing ever changes in boxing.
New faces populate the same old stories.

WRIGHT'S HEIRS BUILD SOME BRIDGES TO THE REAL WORLD
LEAD: Olgivanna Lloyd Wright, the widow of Frank Lloyd Wright, died in March 1985, and for more than three years after that, her bedroom in the Wright residence at Taliesin West remained empty.
There was no surprise to the fact that the room was left like a shrine: Taliesin, which is owned by the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and functions as part tourist attraction, part architecture school, part Wright archive and part ongoing architectural practice, has always had an oddly worshipful, almost cultlike quality to it.


NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Augusta, Me.;   Mobile-Home Ban Outlawed

Murder in an English Village
LEAD: To the Editor:


CRIME
LEAD: Time stills and then stops altogether for SAND CASTLES (Mysterious Press, $17.95), in which Nicolas Freeling unceremoniously restores to life his well-beloved Dutch detective, Commissaris Piet van der Valk, whom he killed off in ''Aupres de Ma Blonde'' almost two decades ago.

Paris Couture: Living Up to the Legend
LEAD: THE PARIS COUTURE IS THE OLYMPIAD of fashion design.
In this biannual arena in which a chosen few compete, a couturier has free reign to create whatever vision he has in mind.
Money is no object, and the most magnificent materials, accessories and artisans are at his fingertips.
The news media of the world are there to cover the results, and, in turn, the publicity helps sell large quantities of more affordable products bearing the couturier's label.

Question Of the Week;   What Do You Think of The Baseball Impasse?
LEAD: The whole idea of a lockout is absurd.
We faithful fans, numbed by winter, have been looking forward to the new season.
And who's responsible for the high salaries, anyway?
Certainly not the players.
The owners have backed themselves into a corner and are now resorting to very unpleasant methods to get themselves out of it.


Now, to Negotiate The Contours of Apartheid's End
LEAD: THE old man who walked out of the prison farm near Cape Town a week ago was proof even to South Africa's critics that President F. W. de Klerk was serious about changing the universally despised system of apartheid.
The unconditional release of Nelson Mandela, now 71 years old, was more than a concession to the world, for it set in motion a process that the Government hopes will produce a new constitution giving the black majority long overdue political rights without jeopardizing the interests of the white minority.


Upheaval in the East: Has Castro Caught the Bug?;   Cubans Outline Plan to 'Perfect' Communist Rule
LEAD: Cuba's Communist Party leadership today announced what it described as plans for deep reforms in the country's political system.
But its statement made it clear that Cuba was not abandoning one-party Communist rule.


If You're Thinking of Living in: Fort Lee
LEAD: THE name George Washington brings grimaces to the faces of many Fort Lee residents.
But it's not the Father of the Country - who laid out a fort on the site in 1776 - they have a grudge against; it's the bridge named for him, the one that was opened in 1931 to connect New Jersey with Manhattan.


Question Of the Week;   What Do You Think of The Baseball Impasse?
LEAD: Owners collude to hold free-agent costs down, or they engage in cutthroat bidding wars that lead to absurdly inflated contracts for journeymen players.
Neither the owners nor the players seem to recognize any common interest with the fans.
Get the fans to walk away, and one fine day the whole enterprise will collapse like a house of bubble-gum baseball cards.

On Language;   If You Will
LEAD: The National - our first all-sports daily newspaper distributed nationwide - was launched last month by the ace sportswriter Frank Deford.
It appears to be a literate publication; one headline in its first issue over a story about the New York Knicks basketball center Patrick Ewing was ''The Center Is Holding,'' an allusion to William Butler Yeats's poem ''The Center Cannot Hold.

More Hype Than HOPE
LEAD: The Bush Administration's new housing initiative, announced with great ballyhoo by the President and Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, certainly has a ring to it.
HOPE, it's called, the last word in inspirational acronyms: Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere, a package filled with promising programs.


Little Activity in Plan B Marketplace
LEAD: From Feb. 1 to April 1, under so-called Plan B free agency, 490 National Football League players are free to sign with new teams without having the new teams compensate the old.

Data Bank/February 18, 1990


ROMAN SILVER FIT FOR THE BATHS
LEAD: To the ancient Romans, sumptuous silver was a status symbol to be displayed at home and at the public bath.
Sotheby's exhibition of 14 magnificent silver vessels - four large plates, five jugs, two buckets, a basin, a vase and a casket for toiletries - may help to explain why.
The hefty tablewares, said to be from the fourth to the fifth centuries and described by the auction house as the largest and finest collection of ancient

Although the musical language of many Japanese composers remains rooted in an internationalist style (especially the ''color-field'' style so prevalent here and in Europe since the 60's, best exemplified by composers such as Witold Lutoslawski or Gyorgy Ligeti), it is being molded with confidence into a more typically ''Japanese'' character.

A Dreary Thriller Spirals Downward

LEAD: The Essex House, at 160 Central Park South between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, is undergoing a renovation that includes redecorating it to bring it more in line with the Art Deco design it had when it opened in 1931.
The $55 million project, scheduled to continue until early next year, will reduce the number of guest rooms from 690 to 580, making some larger and converting others into two-room suites.


Question Of the Week;   What Do You Think of The Baseball Impasse?

New York City Is Out of the Needle Trade

And until recently, their circumstances were anything but the best.


GOSPEL PRAISES THE LORD AND SINGS THE BLUES
LEAD: There's no sonic boundary between the sacred and the profane.
Melodies, rhythms and inflections have no allegiances; they're free agents, at the service of anyone with the technique to perform them.
In Europe, popular songs were the foundations for medieval cantus firmus masses; in Latin America, the rhythms of

Pastimes;   Around the Garden
LEAD: For This Week: Days are getting longer and growth is resuming on house plants.

Check plants outdoors for wind and winter injury; prune out any broken or dead limbs, but, in spite of recent mild weather, it is too early to carry out any major garden activities.


Maneuvering in Lucia's Footsteps
LEAD: HUNDREDS of tourists who make the somewhat bucolic two-hour rail trip from London to Rye each year have never heard of Lucia, Miss Mapp or E. F. Benson - and more's the pity.
It isn't that the East Sussex town, one of the ''Cinque Ports and Two Ancient Towns'' forged as a unit in the 11th century, isn't worthwhile without this esoteric knowledge.


CRUCIAL RULING DUE IN PARK RAPE CASE
LEAD: A critical ruling in the Central Park rape case is expected this week when the presiding judge is scheduled to decide whether to admit as evidence the incriminating videotaped statements made by five of the six youthful defendants charged in the attack.

ART ENDURES
LEAD: As everyone knows, the winter of 1989-90 has seen the birth in Central and Eastern Europe of a new collective noun - ''a toppling of tyrants.'' In earlier times, tyrants, if toppled at all, were toppled one by one.
Others, of whom Stalin was the great and terrible exemplar, lived out long lifetimes as if set in marble.


Review/Music;   D.R.I. Mix Of Angry Rock Ideas
LEAD: D.R.I., a four-man band from Texas, used to sound like hundreds of other hard-core rock bands, yelling out angry lyrics over fast, choppy, sputtering guitars and drums.
Then it got a bright idea: to combine hard core with equally angry heavy metal, thus addressing more camps of listeners.
With its album ''Crossover,'' D.R.I.

'Enemy of the People' With a Striking Coda

Review/Dance;   Another Robbins-Balanchine Pairing

Our Greatest Asset: Educated Workers
LEAD: WE hear much of the economic decline of Long Island.
The key to recovery is the creation of jobs in the service industries and the computer and communications technologies they depend upon.


Fashion;   Spreading Style at Lower Prices
LEAD: Oscar is doing it, and so is Calvin.
So, in fact, are Geoffrey and Bill.
What Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein, Geoffrey Beene and Bill Blass are doing is knocking themselves off in lower-priced lines that have the potential of reaching many more customers and ringing up millions of dollars more in sales.


A Festive Bahamas Regatta
LEAD: THE Exumas are like beads off a broken necklace: just when you think you've collected them all, you step on another one.
I've been picking them up on and off for almost 20 years, and am still looking.

By John M. Del Vecchio.
790 pp. New York: Bantam Books. $19.95.


Teachers Know It's an Uphill Struggle
LEAD: After reading Mathias B. Freese's article, ''Teachers Have No Chance to Give Their Best'' (Long Island Opinion, Jan. 21), I feel compelled to respond to the blatant cynicism expressed by the author.


Third Executive Resigns at Corcoran Gallery
LEAD: The Corcoran Gallery of Art has announced the resignation of Bruce H. Yenawine, dean of the Corcoran School of Art.

LEAD: Students at Tufts University boycotted classes and rallied on Thursday to protest a freeze on financial aid that they say could leave some needy students without assistance.


'The Fate of the Forest'
LEAD: To the Editor:


New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: There are any number of annoying, irritating, I'm-going-to-tear-my-hair-out sounds: chalk scratched along a blackboard, the slow drip of a leaking faucet, the sound emanating from the earphones halfway down the bus or subway car, the horn on the car parked outside your window that suddenly starts up at midnight and doesn't stop, doesn't stop, doesn't stop.


No Repertory Rule For Touring Ensembles
LEAD: Happily, among the faults of our beleaguered National Endowment for the Arts is not found a repertory requirement for touring chamber ensembles, as reported in the article about the Da Capo Chamber Players (''Not All Old and Not All New,'' Jan. 7).


The Consistency Of a Career Illuminated
LEAD: Witold Lutoslawski's uncanny color sense is usually the first aspect of his music to strike a listener.
But the way he precisely and unconventionally manipulates a palate of stunning instrumental timbres into a language of intense expressive gestures is but one of the remarkable aspects of the Polish composer's music.


Correction
LEAD: A review of ''Silver Stallion'' by the Korean novelist Ahn Junghyo on Feb. 4 rendered the author's family name incorrectly.
The review should have referred to him as Mr.
Ahn, not Mr.
Junghyo.

H.
Carl Powell of Augusta, Ga.

THE KENNEDY CLAN (CONTINUED)
LEAD: May the saints preserve us - not another television drama about the Kennedys!
Irish or not, that's the way a good many people may feel about the prospect of devoting six hours to the ABC mini-series ''The Kennedys of Massachusetts'' (two-hour installments begin tonight at 9 and continue tomorrow, with the conclusion on Wednesday).


Another Channel War: Owners vs. Builders
LEAD: Long gone are the days when history, nationalism and mutual suspicion fed doubts that Britain and France would ever be linked by a tunnel under the English Channel.
The doubts remain, but today the reason is money.


Lyndhurst Journal;   Township Fights County Over Relocation of Waste Scales
LEAD: OFFICIALS here, frustrated by months of stalled negotiations with the Bergen County Utilities Authority over the amount of money the township is entitled to for participating in the authority's solid-waste disposal operation, have decided to settle the dispute the old-fashioned way.

But the university has begun to try to calm down some of the fans.


Europe's Grand Classics of Skiing;   In Austria, The Serious and The Upper Crust
LEAD: PERHAPS the biggest attraction for American skiers in the Alps is that generally the resorts there - unlike the Northeast and the Rockies - were not created for skiing.
They are essentially villages that were always there, amid magnificent mountain terrain on which winter sports were easily grafted.


'Challenger' Looks At the Human Side Of the Disaster
LEAD: ''Challenger,'' a TV film about the shuttle disaster that will be broadcast next Sunday evening at 8 on ABC, begins with an auspicious claim of factual authenticity.
While most other docudramas merely give notice at the end of the credits that they are based on a book or two, this production offers a lengthy message that appears in white letters on a black screen.


Greeks Feel the Pinch as Two U.S. Bases Close
LEAD: A popular Greek cartoon shows American G.I.'s, a look of indifference on their faces, carrying out crates of personal belongings as they abandon their military bases in Greece.
Taken away with the belongings is a Greek protester clutching a ''Yankee go home'' sign, a look of bewilderment betraying his confusion at being left without a cause.

Canada
LEAD: To the Editor: Here is a warning of entrapment at the Canadian border for all American tourists.


Long Shot Earns Spot On Pro Basketball Team
LEAD: AT first glance, Greg Grant would appear to have no business playing in the National Basketball Association.
He is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 145 pounds.
Five years ago, he was a college dropout selling fish in his hometown.
He then returned to school and became a standout player at Trenton State College, hardly a collegiate basketball power.


Correction
LEAD: An essay by Jean-Claude Baker on Feb. 4 about Josephine Baker omitted credit for his collaborator.
Mr.
Baker wrote the article with Chris Chase.


Miss Armstrong to Wed in June
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.

New York's Census Is a Campaign: Stand Up and Don't Be Undercounted
LEAD: On a recent Sunday morning, before Mass had ended, the pastor of St.
Catherine of Genoa church in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn announced a visitor.
Parishioners stirred in their pews as the guest approached the front of the altar, then turned to face the congregation, made up mostly of immigrants from Haiti and other


Marx, Subverted
LEAD: Karl Marx must be cringing in his grave.
The draft platform of the Soviet Union's Communist Party that was published last week contains an economic bombshell: approval of private ownership of private capital.
This proposed surrender of the party's economic dictatorship is every bit as radical as the document's proposed surrender of the party's 70-year political dictatorship.


Berliners to Enjoy Easier Passage Between East and West


Susan Kerr, a TV Executive, Marries
LEAD: Susan Jane Kerr and Allan R. Dragone Jr. were married yesterday at St.

LEAD: Four weeks after troops swarmed into this seaside city to suppress a nationalist uprising, the most popular excursion for classes at local schools is the hilltop park where the city has buried its dead.


Teachers Know It's An Uphill Struggle
LEAD: I hope that Mr.
Freese feels better after his whining diatribe on the shortcomings of his students appeared in the Long Island section.
Teachers like Mr.
Freese indeed ''have no chance to give their best.'' His contempt for his students and their parents is evident.


DISPUTE IN SENATE ON FINANCE REFORM
LEAD: Supporters of the Democrats' leading campaign finance proposal say Senator Alan Cranston, the California Democrat whose fund-raising techniques are under the scrutiny of Federal law-enforcement authorities, is quietly maneuvering to dilute the measure.


A Woman's Middle Years
LEAD: To the Editor:


Changing Thoughts on Furs
LEAD: TEN years ago, I finally got the full-length mink coat I'd wanted for years.
It was then considered the elegant, mature woman's symbol of taste and class and had the unique advantage of ''fitting in'' wherever it was worn, whether over a pair of jeans to the supermarket, to a funeral or covering sequins on their way to a New Year's

National Pro-Am.


Secretive Nicaraguan Voters Leave Election Hard to Call
LEAD: After a decade of war, economic crisis and political polarization, Nicaraguans will vote in eight days in this country's first free and broadly contested democratic election.
But because most voters, wary of such freedom, remain deeply reluctant to discuss their personal views, even the best-informed specialists say they are at a loss to predict who will win.


Paying Attention
LEAD: To the Editor:


Review/Music;   Post-Modernist Pastiche
LEAD: The Dance Theater Workshop opened its music series on Monday with a band led by the composer Steve Elson.
Mr.
Elson, a saxophonist, accordionist and composer, has worked with mainstream pop acts and new-music composers, and his music was full of references and stylistic approximations.


From Morgan To Milken: Two Drexel Legacies
LEAD: It was front-page news, but the collapse of the House of Drexel, ending a saga that ran from J. Pierpont Morgan to Michael R. Milken, was greeted with a yawn in the financial markets.

RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:
Golf
Forsman Takes Lead: Blustery winds were so severe that Dan Forsman needed only a par 72 to rally and take the third-round lead yesterday in the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open tournament at La Jolla, Calif.
With winds gusting more than 40 miles and hour, and occasionally accompanied by a drizzly rain, Forsman outlasted other struggling contenders to establish a two-stroke margin at 203, 13 under par on the South course at Torrey Pines.


Caring's Dollar Value
LEAD: While the responsibility of management is to increase shareholder value, that does not preclude a corporation from engaging in socially responsible activities.
Indeed, such activities may prove to increase shareholder value.


Fear of Directors
LEAD: To the Editor:


The King of Conflict of Interest
LEAD: For nearly two years now, Don King and Mike Tyson have emerged as the Siamese twins of boxing.
Siamese twins joined at the money clip.
One is seldom seen in public without the other.
And last Tuesday, as King apologized meekly and weakly for having protested that James (Buster) Douglas didn't deserve to be the new heavyweight champion because of a long count, the promoter kept using the word ''we,'' meaning himself and the dethroned champion who was sitting nearby.


I.R.S. INVESTIGATING FOREIGN COMPANIES FOR TAX CHEATING

S.R.O. in Moscow
LEAD: Mstislav Rostropovich had his audience all but dancing in the aisles last week when he returned to the Soviet Union for the first time in 16 years and gave a concert of other Russians' greatest hits.
Mr.
Rostropovich, who was forced out of the Soviet Union in 1974 after his career hit a dead end over his support for Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, drew curtain call after curtain call on the conclusion of a program at the Moscow Conservatory that included symphonies by Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich.


A Loss For the Theater
LEAD: When Dennis McIntyre died on Feb. 1 (of cancer, at the age of 47), obituaries were brief and, for many, his name was unfamiliar.
Sadly, his death will not inspire Broadway eulogies, but his life says something revealing about the plight of the playwright.
He was a fine playwright with the potential to be a major one, but more than many of his peers he had difficulty getting his work produced.


Don't Forget Baseball's Young Fans
LEAD: Why should I care about Major League baseball?
After eight years as a judge in criminal and juvenile court, why would I have special concerns about the 1990 season and the disputes between the players and owners?


Question Of the Week;   What Do You Think of The Baseball Impasse?
LEAD: Whether or not I attend any games or watch any on television, I'm going to have to pay for the monetary fiasco, just as I'm going to help pay for the savings and loan scandals.
So I say ''a pox on all their houses'': players, owners, television (networks and stations), sponsors and all the rest.


A Bookstore Where Books Are Heard
LEAD: AT the Little Professor Book Center in Niantic, fledgling writers meet to talk about writing, established authors give readings and children attend story hours.

Reviews/Music;   A New Old-Instruments Ensemble
LEAD: The Classical Band, New York's first major attempt to create a period-instruments orchestra, is in the midst of its inaugural season.
Wednesday evening's all-Beethoven concert at Carnegie Hall, the ensemble's first under a conductor other than its founder, Trevor Pinnock, had its palpable charms.
But it also suggested that the orchestra is still very much feeling its way.

CAN HE SAVE THE ELEPHANTS?
LEAD: The burning of the elephant tusks taken from poachers was a marvelous symbolic gesture.
However, as I recall, the ivory burned was worth approximately $3 million.
It seems to me it would have been wiser for the Government to sell the ivory and use the income for elephant-protection services.

Pastimes;   Chess

LIFE IN THE EXECUTIVE SUITE AFTER DREXEL
LEAD: With the demise last week of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a collective sigh of relief is sweeping the board rooms of corporate America.

Corrections
LEAD: A picture caption last Sunday with an article about efforts to stop emigration from Israel characterized Mordechai Glick incorrectly.
He is a member of the Organization to Stop Emigration From Israel but is not its head.
The caption also misidentified the setting.
It was Mr.
Glick's home, not his office.


Pastimes;   Coins
LEAD: The phrase ''Do good, make good'' seems like a good motto to live by, but when found on a curious set of aluminum tokens, it's a reminder of a turbulent period of American prison reform.
Prisoners at Auburn and Sing Sing prisons in New York used the tokens when morale and discipline were at an all-time high.

Question Of the Week;   What Do You Think of The Baseball Impasse?
LEAD: I hope I'm not the only one who is rooting for the baseball players and owners to remain at an impasse forever, until the owners file for bankruptcy and the players go on welfare.

WILLIAM BAKER
Bloomfield, N.J.


Hurting at Illinois

I'm frustrated.''


Gotti or No Gotti, The Mafia Looks Infirm These Days
LEAD: FOR John Gotti it was a moment of triumph.

Campus Life: Princeton;   Trying to Erase Their Image As Drinking Clubs
LEAD: Princeton University's 13 private eating clubs provide meals to about 75 percent of the upperclassmen and, until recently, alcohol to hundreds of underclassmen, many of them under age.
But if last weekend's club initiation parties are a guide, new rules on alcohol use are turning these campus social centers into bastions of sobriety.


The Quest for Synthetic Blood
LEAD: The long search for synthetic blood for use in transfusions is becoming a neck-and-neck race between companies working on ''white bloods'' and those working on ''reds.'' The goal is to find a substance that is easy to use and free from contaminants like hepatitis or the AIDS virus.

Review/Concert;   Speculum Musicae in All-British Bill
LEAD: Speculum Musicae's evening at Merkin Concert Hall on Wednesday was called ''Music From the British Isles,'' and three of its four composers seemed to be asking, if not the same question, at least a very similar one: Is it the job of creators to tame chaos or do they find even more profit in exploiting it?


Q and A
LEAD:
Viennese Balls


Corrections
LEAD: The Practical Traveler column on Sept. 10 misstated the policy of Trans World Airlines on bereavement fares.
The one-third refund for an airline ticket to a family member's funeral applies only to full fares, not to discounts.
The Times queried T.W.A. in October after receiving a reader complaint; T.W.A.


HIS BUS CAME IN
LEAD: I realize tiat Danny Aiello's head must be swimming after playing supporting parts in such deathless masterpieces as ''Harlem Nights'' and ''Fort Apache, the Bronx,'' so it's no surprise he failed to mention that he played a leading role in my play ''Gemini.'' It's my recollection that he was with us for nearly three years, Off, and, eventually, on Broadway in the late 1970's.


Jean Wallace, 66, Screen Actress Known for 1940's and 50's Roles

Mr.

Michael O'Sullivan of Somers, N.Y.


Diverting Musical Farce
LEAD: THE Forum Theater Group may still be on the lookout for the lesser-known, perhaps esoteric or ''unsung'' musicals that have become the theater's trademark, more or less.
For the moment, though, let's say that the theater's artistic credo has been amended by, or converted to, shows on Yiddish themes.


Singapore
LEAD: To the Editor: Having just read Steven Erlanger's piece on ''What's Doing in Singapore'' (Travel, Dec. 24), I have two comments.
First, the article failed to mention one of the greatest pleasures of travel in Singapore - food.


Review/Music;   Misha Dichter Returns to the Schnabel Tradition
LEAD: Misha Dichter's Carnegie Hall recital on Thursday evening, the first of two celebrating the 30th anniversary of his stage debut, was a pleasant surprise.
To begin with, the pianist constructed an excellent and demanding program of late Beethoven, late Schubert and late Brahms: repertory, as the advance publicity noted, ''with which he is not usually associated.


Ambergris
LEAD: To the editor: My wife and I love snorkeling and skin diving but a series of hip replacement operations has made climbing ladders into dive boats a real struggle for her, especially in choppy water.


Managing the Care of Elderly Relatives

Good or Just Lucky?
LEAD: No doubt about it, it has been a spectacular few months for George Bush.


A NEW LOOK AT WHAT'S IN A NAME
LEAD: Words like Romanticism, Classicism and Serialism, the common coin of musical commentary, can become so worn from continual handling that they lose all value.
They take on a mystical fogginess, emphasized by Germanic capitalization, that makes them impressively abstract but worthless as tools for thought.


Three Aspects of U.S. Glass Explored
LEAD: THREE distinct facets of the world of American glass, past and present, are on exhibit here at the Hudson River Museum. ''Persians,'' a series of sculptural blown-glass assemblages by Dale Chihuly, a leading artist in his field, is the dramatic centerpiece of three shows that will run through March 18.

Going to Trial
LEAD: Pressure has been rising on Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. of Washington to resign, but he appears determined to face at least one more set of voters - 12 of them.

In China, Loving Lady Chatterley
LEAD: For the better part of 25 years, I felt discontented with teaching in America.
This is not a country that reads much, or believes that the little it is required to read has anything to do with the world of banks, cars and missile silos.
We are practical to a fault, clean mental machines, so Thoreau, Whitman and Mark Twain go in one ear and pass out the other, frequently without impediment, loss of speed or any notable effect.


The Selling of Western Water Rights
LEAD: Last September, the City Council of Aurora, Colo., approved a $1.25 million purchase of agricultural water rights in the South Platte river basin.
Eager to secure more water for its rapidly growing population, this municipality east of Denver joined numerous others throughout the West by turning to what it sees as the only vast pool remaining: irrigation water.


Style Makers;   Berdie Stein, Frame Designer
LEAD: An almost universal reaction to ''My Frame,'' which was conceived by Berdie Stein, is ''How come no one thought of it before?'' But no one did and that's why children's art was, until last year, usually stuck on refrigerator doors or taped on walls.
And that's how the company ''My Art'' was born.


Nepal Vows to Stop Protests By Advocates of Democracy
LEAD: Nepal has put the police and the military on alert and detained hundreds of people in an effort to crush plans to begin a pro-democracy campaign on Sunday.


Wall Street;   Rocky Times for Trump's Bonds By DIANA B. HENRIQUES
LEAD: Donald J. Trump's marriage is not the only one of his important relationships that is not working out these days.
His rapport with the ''junk bond'' market - whose contribution to his success arguably approaches that of his estranged wife, Ivana - has become equally rocky.


Waltrip Thriving On a Subtler Style
LEAD: Dominance isn't given up very easily at the Daytona 500.
Like a driver in the 10-car conga lines that roll down the backstretch in a bumper-to-bumper draft, if you want to cut in near the front, you could be bucking the turbulence a long time.


Plastic Packaging: An Unwarranted Bias
LEAD: As executive editor of two food-industry magazines during the last decade, I have had occasion to cover various food-packaging issues, including chlorofluocarbons (CFC's) and the current controversy over banning plastic food packaging.
It was therefore distressing to read County Legislator Paul Feiner's Jan.


Remembering Earl Monroe
LEAD: To the Sports Editor:


Europe's Grand Classics of Skiing;   Italian Towns Of Variety
LEAD: PERHAPS the biggest attraction for American skiers in the Alps is that generally the resorts there - unlike the Northeast and the Rockies - were not created for skiing.
They are essentially villages that were always there, amid magnificent mountain terrain on which winter sports were easily grafted.


SONY'S NORIO OHGA: BUILDING SMALLER, BUYING BIGGER
LEAD: IT IS MIDAFTERNOON IN A SLEEK ANNEX TO the Sony Corporation's headquarters in Tokyo, and Norio Ohga and Michael P. (Mickey) Schulhof are sitting in a plush screening room reserved for the company's top executives.

A Feeling of Continuity in Oyster Bay
LEAD: THE corner of West Main and Spring Streets in Oyster Bay has been the location of three restaurants in the last three years.

LEAD:
COMPANIES
Drexel: Driven From the Market It Created
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection Tuesday amid ironies heaped as high as its clients' - and now its own -debts.
The brokerage house has been driven from a ''junk bond'' market it created.

LEAD: THE SPRING OF 1990 holds the promise of momentous transformations as the nations of Eastern Europe hold elections in their quest for democracy, and as a disengaged Soviet Union strives to forge ahead with change amid an explosion of internal conflicts.
Marc D. Charney and Anne Zusy of The Week in Review compiled a country-by-country look at where things stand in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.


The Sahara
LEAD: To the Editor: I seriously question the propriety of featuring the article by Erik Sandberg-Diment (''Across the Sahara by Car,'' Dec. 31).
As adults, the Sandberg-Diments have every right to risk their lives by traveling through that unpredictable and hostile environment.
I am appalled, however, that they were accompanied by their children, especially a 7-year-old.


Dining: ON THEIR OWN
LEAD: The designer Bill Blass perks up when the subject comes up.
A popular man about town wherever he is, Blass dreams of dining alone. ''In New York, it would be in bed; in the country, on a card table set in front of the fire,'' he muses. ''If it's diet, it would be Lean Cuisine.
Indulgence?'' - a big smile here - ''Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream!


A Secluded Indonesian Isle
LEAD: LOMBOK.
It sounds like a planet on ''Star Trek.'' The island is not really in outer space, but, as I showed my son on the globe, it was literally on the other side of the world, some 10,000 miles away in Indonesia.


$1 a Pound and Nutritious? Squid
LEAD: AT a dollar a pound, which is what it is selling for in Chinatown these days, squid must be the cheapest seafood you can buy.
It is also extremely nutritious, being low in fat and calories and high in protein.


ASPEN: THE CALL OF THE WILD
LEAD: Why did you have to do a cover story about the high-rolling tourists of Aspen?
The Italians have an apt expression that fits them: faccia da schiaffi, which roughly translates as ''faces to slap.''


Georges Forest; Canadian Language Campaigner, 65
LEAD: Georges Forest, Manitoba's most prominent champion of French-language rights, died on Wednesday night, apparently of a heart attack.
He was 65 years old.


WORKING ON THE MECHANICS
LEAD: How I enjoyed Lesley Hazleton's article about her venture into the world of the internal combustion engine (Hers: ''Working on the Mechanics,'' Jan. 14).
It reminded me of my own first, shy requests for initiation into the marvels of 10-wheelers, compaction trucks, backhoes and - my personal favorite - our landfill's 953 ''cat'' bulldozer.

Proper Disposal Of Medical Waste
LEAD: I read with interest Dr.
William A. Dwyer's letter to the New Jersey editor entitled ''Fees for Disposing of Medical Waste'' (Jan. 21).


Fair and Square
LEAD: It is the consensus in the boxing world that shortly after he demonstrated that he was the toughest man on the planet, James (Buster) Douglas was very nearly mugged in broad daylight.
Douglas, a 29-year-old journeyman boxer, had in the minds of many fans gone as far as could be expected just by stepping into the same ring with Mike Tyson, the undefeated heavyweight champion.


1st Grade 1925, 1st Grade Today
LEAD: On Wednesday evening my grandson William called to give me an assignment. ''It's the 75th birthday of my school,'' he explained, ''and Mrs.

Michael the Archangel Roman Catholic Church in Portland, Ore.
The Rev.
Edward G. Holterhoff officiated.


Mystery Master Gives His Town a Gift. It's Murder
LEAD: EVERYBODY had a soft spot for 16-year-old Sally Anders.
Friends and family members described her as sweet and responsible, an average teen-ager who looked forward to school dances, sang in the church choir and auditioned for the school play.
Why then, asked residents of her quiet Connecticut town, would someone want to murder her?


The Art of Turning Ethnicity Into Entertainment
LEAD: ''Ethnic Dance'' is the usual label affixed to any troupe that looks foreign and whose offerings are not in the realm of modern dance or ballet.
The latest entrants would seem to be the Don Cossacks from the Soviet Union and the Jose Greco Company of Spanish Dancers, Singers and Musicians - two groups that are stirring up enthusiastic audiences this month.


Anheuser-Busch's Campaign Against Abusive Drinking
LEAD: To the Editor:


Campus Life: Miami;   Week of Protests Against Increase In Tuition
LEAD: Wearing black armbands ''to mourn the death of affordable tuition at U.M.,'' students at the University of Miami held demonstrations last week to protest higher charges.


When Self-Consciousness Became King
LEAD: ''Culture and Commentary, an 80's Perspective,'' at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, is that rarity in the world of contemporary art, an ambitious and coherent theme show in which the work of every artist - even those as overexposed as Jenny Schnabel and Cindy Sherman - makes more sense than it did before.


Lifestyle: Sunday Outing;   A Place Where Flowers Come In From the Cold
LEAD: Though spring is officially more than a month away, there is always something blooming at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.
Situated on 250 acres of hills, gardens, forest and streams, the garden offers an abundance of green growing things to winter-weary visitors.


Men at Work
LEAD: Overheard in a Manhattan restaurant, one woman to another: ''He's a terrific father, but he's never home.''


Corrections
LEAD: The headline on the Commercial Property column on page 13 of the Real Estate section today misstates the decision of the Durst Organization on a midtown project.
As the column reports, Durst plans to build one-story retail buildings on the site.


China After Tiananmen Square
LEAD: WHO would be the first to mention Tiananmen Square, I wondered as I embarked on a 12-day tour of China in December with 33 other Americans - one of the first large tourist groups back in China since the events of last June 4.
The speculation was incredibly naive.


The Anti-Dumping Laws Do Work
LEAD: To the Editor:


Long Island Journal
LEAD:

Campus Life: Chatham;   After 121 Years, Don't Admit Men Now, Students Say
LEAD: Students at Chatham College, the oldest women's college in Pennsylvania, say they feel abandoned, betrayed and angry over a proposal to admit men to the 121-year-old school.


Teachers Know It's an Uphill Struggle
LEAD: ''Teachers Have No Chance To Give Their Best'' is the lament of Mathias B. Freese's article, yet Freese keeps teaching English.
A saving remnant, perhaps.
I stopped teaching English more than 10 years ago on a beautiful springlike morning.


TALKING: Insider Deals;   A Guide To Co-op Bargaining
LEAD: AS hundreds of residential buildings in the New York City area were converted from rental to co-op status in the last decade, the tenants, regarded as insiders, were offered their apartments at prices as much as 40 percent below those posted for outside buyers.


THE PRICE THEY PAY: OLDER CHILDREN AND DIVORCE
LEAD: THEY WERE MORE SANGUINE ABOUT Laura.
She was, after all, in college and on the far side of growing up.
They said she had loosened her tether to the family and was no longer hostage to the twists of their fate.
They allowed that she would be shaken for a time by their divorce, but insisted that before long she would find her balance and regain her stride.


STREETSCAPES: The Bloomingdale's Block;   Five Little Brownstones and How They Survived
LEAD: AS Bloomingdale's and its parent, Federated Department Stores, seek to reorganize in the wake of bankruptcy proceedings, the store's unusual, low-rise home on a block site - 59th to 60th Streets, Lexington to Third Avenues - also is attracting notice.
Any attempts to sell off the store itself would be affected by the split ownership of the property.


WALL STREET'S WONDER BOYS
LEAD: The cynicism of Bruce Wasserstein and those in his profession is no better illustrated than by his remark: ''Robert Campeau failed to do three things. . . .
He did not float new junk-bond issues. . . .
He did not mortgage his properties. . . .
And he did not sell assets.'' (''Wall Street's Wonder Boys: Slightly Tarnished,'' by L.


Europe's Grand Classics of Skiing;   Legends of Style And Diversity In Switzerland
LEAD: PERHAPS the biggest attraction for American skiers in the Alps is that generally the resorts there - unlike the Northeast and the Rockies - were not created for skiing.
They are essentially villages that were always there, amid magnificent mountain terrain on which winter sports were easily grafted.


Lendl Eliminates McEnroe Easily
LEAD: When his hands weren't on his hips with a scold on his lips, they were raised in indignation.
Neither posture did much for his tennis game.


Correction
LEAD: An article on Jan. 28 about United States policy toward illegal immigrants from Central America misidentified a former Immigration Commissioner.
He is Alan C. Nelson.


Hanging Wall Cabinets
LEAD: HANGING wall cabinets, even an individual cabinet, can be a tricky task for amateurs.
But by planning the job beforehand, using the proper tools and fasteners and having at least one helper, a good job can be done without too much trouble.


Some Donors To Neediest Are Unknown
LEAD: Among the fattest files to accumulate during the 78th annual New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which is nearing its conclusion, is the one containing requests that donors not be identified.


World Markets;   Volatility in South Africa's Markets
LEAD: Humphrey Borkum, a director of South Africa's largest brokerage house, wasn't surprised by what Nelson Mandela said when he was released last week from prison after more than 27 years.
But other players in the South African stock market apparently were.


Culture and Stigma Slow AIDS Reports in Mideast
LEAD: Tradition, culture and religion have contributed to a timid and tardy recognition of the existence of the AIDS virus in much of the Middle East, medical experts said at a conference here this week.


Drugs: Has the Tide Changed, or Only the Spin?
LEAD: AS President Bush set out for the inter-American conference on drug fighting last week, he spoke so much of the ''headway'' and ''success'' and ''cooperation'' already accomplished that it was not clear why he needed to go.


Report of Riots in Soviet Republic Is Denied
LEAD: A regional Communist Party leader today denied reports of rioting in the republic of Uzbekistan, and another top official said the rumors were aimed at inflaming ethnic tensions in the neighboring republic of Tadzhikistan.


Catholic Schools Close as Costs Outpace Parishes
LEAD: To Charles Trotta, St.
Boniface Martyr School in Sea Cliff, L.I., was always more than a place where education mixed with morning prayer and swift discipline.
It represented a link to his past and, until this year, his future.


Shift in the Western Alliance's Focus: From Moscow to a United Germany?
LEAD: As the Soviet threat to Western Europe diminishes and the Warsaw Pact becomes a hollow alliance, the role of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is shifting and the alliance is emerging as a potential watchdog over a reunited Germany.


Tax Credits for Health Insurance Won't Work
LEAD: To the Editor:


'LOUIE LOUIE' AND THE ZEITGEIST
LEAD: ''LOUIE LOUIE'' may not be Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
But the by-now mythic cult adulation accorded this three-chord rock archetype invites a brief comparison to Beethoven.
This may seem a tad farfetched, but bear with me.


New Cigarette Raising Issue of Target Market
LEAD: Four weeks after its debacle with a cigarette aimed primarily toward blacks, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company may be heading for a new battle over a cigarette reportedly aimed at young, blue-collar white women.


A MILITARY EDITOR IS SAID TO RESIGN

Answering The Mail
LEAD: Q. Inside the garage, my foundation wall has two hairline cracks oozing a steady stream of sand.
What can be causing this?


Devils Fight a Losing Battle By ALEX YANNIS
LEAD: The Devils and the Maple Leafs used their heavyweight fighters tonight, perhaps as a result of the proceedings in prior meetings between the teams this season.
The game was carefully monitored by the National Hockey League's disciplinarians, and boxing officials would have probably declared the fistfights a draw.


Jan Sigmon Wed to Andrew Dworkin
LEAD: Jan Alison Sigmon, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Jackson Sigmon of Bethlehem, Pa., was married last evening to Andrew L. Dworkin, a son of Ruth Dworkin of New York and the late Bernard Dworkin.
Rabbi Joseph Potasnik officiated at the Peninsula Hotel in New York.

Hoyas Prevail to Extend Pirates' Slump
LEAD: In previous seasons, as Seton Hall was blossoming into a Big East power and Georgetown was making its annual push for conference supremacy, a meeting between the schools could always be counted on to tip the conference standing one way or another.


Lockout Lessens Clubs' Ability to Rate Players
LEAD: If spring training had started on time the other day, if players were running around fields in bright sunshine in Arizona and Florida, some of them would be finding out just how far they have come back from serious injuries and, in many instances, surgery.
More important to their teams, managers would be learning where the players are and how far they had to go before the season starts.


About Men;   The Case For Grad School
LEAD: AT LAST IT HAPPENED.
Four years of college, one more for good measure - all told a half-decade of great books and gregarious nights and green lawns and girls - and then one day some malignant force somewhere, some vile conspiracy of time and teachers and empty-pocketed parents had the nerve to hand me a diploma.


Rally by Redmen Falls Short
LEAD: Carlton Screen ran the show, the rest of the Providence Friars ran the floor and Lou Carnesecca, the St.
John's coach, nearly ran into the stands last night as St.
John's lost to Providence, 77-74.


Gina Bandini and Dan Cooper Marry
LEAD: Gina Pia Bandini, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Parallel Seen in Mandela Release And Shifts to Black Rule in Africa

Painless Way to Cut Social Security Deductions;   Saving the System
LEAD: To the Editor:


ASPEN: THE CALL OF THE WILD
LEAD: As regular vistors to Aspen for over 20 years, we know that Jon Bowermaster's description is all too accurate (''Aspen: The Call of the Wild,'' Jan. 21).
If your story were only about a small Rocky Mountain town, it would be merely an amusing tale about silly people.
It is, unfortunately, a parable about America.

Corrections

It applies only to passengers arriving from the West Coast.
Fares for seven-night cruises of the Song of Norway were misstated; the range is $1,145 to $2,630.


Dodgers Bring About A Change of Seasons
LEAD: You are looking for baseball - for some kind of sign that spring has arrived and that life goes on - so you come here.
And in a time of lockouts and cold-hearted negotiating sessions, you are satisfied.


Experience Is Lacking
LEAD: One of the preliminaries to today's Daytona 500 was a 200-mile race last Sunday sanctioned by the Automobile Racing Club of America as part of its Permatex Super Car series.
The series is a training ground for Nascar's Winston Cup tour, the stock car major league.


Fashion: On the Street;   Outback Chic Sans Sheep
LEAD: The romance with all things Australian continues.
The latest rage from Down Under is the outback coat.


Microphone for Rose
LEAD: His banishment from baseball doesn't apply to baseball broadcasts, so Pete Rose plans to keep his professional interest in the game alive and perhaps kicking this season as a radio commentator.


Corrections
LEAD: An article last Sunday about consumers' reactions to the recall of Perrier mineral water misstated the position of the restaurant Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif.
While Panisse is looking forward to eliminating imported bottle water, it has no definite plan to do so.

In Mardi Gras Season, The Good Times Roll
LEAD: For those who can't make it to New Orleans for Mardi Gras on Feb. 27, and for those who'll be wanting musical souvenirs, February brings an annual bounty of Louisiana music.
From New Orleans proper comes rhythm-and-blues and street-parade music.
And from the bayou country up the Gulf Coast comes bouncy, fiddle-topped


Seeking Landmarks of a Minority Heritage
LEAD: THE rocks where Indians held council over the centuries and a building where black girls and women attended school in the 1830's are among the Connecticut sites on the National Register of Historic Places.

Turning Left or Right? Please Use the Signal
LEAD: I applaud Irving Kamil's article dealing with drivers who fail to use directional signals (''Turning Without Telling,'' Opinion page, Jan. 7).
While our area is so much better than California in this regard, one can't help but be appalled by the lack of courtesy this shows.


Organizer Bans Liquor At Antidrug Fund Raiser
LEAD: PEOPLE don't need liquor to have a good time.
That is the message of an alcohol-free dinner dance scheduled for March 3 in Shelton.


Question Of the Week;   What Do You Think of The Baseball Impasse?
LEAD: The owners are wallowing in jillions in profits but are unsatisfied and want another jillion or three, and they are unwilling to share even a fraction of a jillion more with the players - when it is to see the players that we pay our contributions to those huge profits.

LEAD: Once recognized only by those who collected, studied or actually made or used them, fish decoys - lures without hooks - are swimming into public view.


Europe's Grand Classics of Skiing;   In a French Vale, A Pair of Towns Keep Traditions
LEAD: PERHAPS the biggest attraction for American skiers in the Alps is that generally the resorts there - unlike the Northeast and the Rockies - were not created for skiing.
They are essentially villages that were always there, amid magnificent mountain terrain on which winter sports were easily grafted.


Crack Addiction Is Forcing Prostitutes Onto the Streets
LEAD: YOUNG, old, black, white or Hispanic, Long Island's new types of prostitutes share several common bonds.
They are almost all addicted to crack; they are for the most part freelance entrepreneurs who work without pimps, and they are part of what is believed to be the greatest number of women ever to ply the sex trade on the


WHAT'S DOING IN: Orlando
LEAD: If Orlando had not existed before Walt Disney World, those who built the central Florida entertainment empire would probably have had to invent the city.
With 32,000 workers and more than 23 million annual visitors, Disney World relies on Orlando and surrounding communities to house its employees and administer the airport that is the gateway to its three theme parks: the Magic Kingdom, Epcot Center and Disney-MGM


CAN HE SAVE THE ELEPHANTS?
LEAD: Thank God for a brilliant, violent bruiser like Richard Leakey, who stands squarely on the side of the animals and fairness (''Can He Save the Elephants?'' by Jane Perlez, Jan. 7).
I heard him speak at the Explorers Annual Dinner and at the Friends of Conservation fund-raising luncheon last year.
His approach is so blunt and unforgiving and determined that he may serve as the catalyst for many who are anguished over the destruction of elephants and rhinos but feel helpless.


POSTINGS: West Side Landmark;   Rebuilding a Stable
LEAD: The Claremont Riding Academy, a fixture on the Upper West Side for nearly a century - it stables 100 horses and serves almost 50,000 riders a year - has been rescued from the knacker and will undergo an extensive rehabilitation with the help of the city's Industrial Development Agency.

Review/Theater;   Management-Labor Conflict, in 'Special Interests'
LEAD: It's been more than 50 years since plays dedicated to the glory of the labor movement flourished.

In Pupil 'Tracks,' Many See a Means Of Resegregation
LEAD: THE battles over voting rights, school integration and public accommodations have long been more or less settled, but some blacks in the South say they now face subtler forms of discrimination.
In education, they say, it shows up in public school ''tracking'' systems, and the issue was at the heart of black protests here last week.

New &amp; Noteworthy
LEAD:
THE MAN WHO TRIED TO BURN NEW YORK, by Nat Brandt. (Berkley, $3.95.) In one of the more obscure incidents of the Civil War, a band of renegade Confederate soldiers tried to burn New York City in retaliation for what General Sherman did to Atlanta.
In 1986 our reviewer, Patrick Clinton, said Nat Brandt's rendition of the trial of one of the conspirators ''is full of surprising perplexities, and the descriptions of his gradual descent into drunkenness and despair and of his death as the last Confederate to be hanged for spying are memorable reading.


Mongolia to Remove Its Last Stalin Statue
LEAD: Mongolia's Communist Government has decided to remove the last statue of Stalin from the capital, signaling another concession to democratic demands, an official newspaper said today.


Triumph Opened Doors
LEAD: THE so-called miracle victory of the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team at Lake Placid wound up being, quite literally, an icebreaker in terms of the sport's visibility at home and the new stature American hockey attained with the National Hockey League.
Suddenly hockey gained viability as a career for aspiring athletes who might otherwise have looked to other sports as their launching pads.


Cope Takes Flag at Daytona
LEAD: Derrike Cope got into stock-car racing when his baseball career ended with what he called a complete blowout of his right knee.
Another blowout today, this one in Dale Earnhardt's right rear tire with about a mile to go, gave Cope the victory in the Daytona 500, the sport's biggest race.

Prices Fall in Tea Glut
LEAD: The price of tea has fallen to its lowest level in more than five months because a glut of poor-quality tea has swamped the market, traders said last week.

Review/Music;   A Refreshing Side of Mahler, Based in Folk
LEAD: Mahler's songs are, for some, the half-formed embryos from which the later symphonic expanses were to grow.

Mahler's songs tend to speak less extravagantly, with less heart-rending passion and at less length than the symphonies, but they may be more coherent in the process.

A Necessary Cold War?
LEAD: Unraveling the cold war is causing enormous concern and unease.
The big headaches confronting Europe would have been settled long ago if World War II hopes had been fulfilled for maintaining at least friendly East-West relations, if not an actual alliance.


War or Peace in Cambodia?
LEAD: The New York Times's Steven Erlanger reports that several thousand Vietnamese troops appear to have secretly re-entered Cambodia last fall to help stiffen military resistance to the Khmer Rouge.

LEAD: Talks between the United States and Japan on reducing the $49 billion trade imbalance between the two countries ended today with few signs of progress and ample evidence of mutual frustration.


Your Money;   States Increase Tax Vigilance
LEAD: Many taxpayers will find state tax collectors newly vigilant this year.
States are hungry for revenues, and with ever-improving computer and investigatory skills they are making aggressive efforts to step up tax collections.


Area Near Javits Center Is Rezoned
LEAD: The New York City Board of Estimate yesterday approved new zoning and new buildings intended to revitalize the area surrounding the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on the West Side.


Behind That Big Door
LEAD: It is a heavy, polished, brown-stained wooden door with a shiny chrome handle.
I've seen better looking doors, some with brass knockers or small rose-colored windows or carvings of gargoyles, but for an office door, this would have to go under the heading of handsome, or at least serviceable.

Exploring a New Berlin
LEAD: BERLIN, it now seems likely, is to become once more the capital of the Germans.
In principle, that should make the city whole again, a megalopolis of three million people free to reclaim its place among the great centers of European culture and industry.
But it is hard to imagine how the return of the capital will do more than add one more Berlin to the bewildering set already shaped by a tortuous history.


Sampras Reaches Final
LEAD: For 18-year-old Pete Sampras, a draw that became progressively unkind to superstars and inspirational to newcomers allowed him to use a big serve and cool nerves to reach his first career final at the Ebel Pro Indoor tournament.
Already the youngest player entered in the event, today he became the youngest finalist since the tournament's inception 29 years ago.


TO BE BETTER, THINK HARDER
LEAD:
INNOCENCE AND EXPERIENCE
By Stuart Hampshire.
195 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $20.
Folly is an endless maze,
Tangled roots perplex her ways,
How many have fallen there!
They stumble all night over bones of the dead;
And feel they know not what but care;
And wish to lead others when they should be led.William Blake, ''Songs of Innocence and of Experience.

ARROGANCE IN THE NAME OF LIFTOFF?
LEAD: Television is not as simple as it looks.
Not by a long shot.
There are, for instance, two very different ways of approaching ''Challenger,'' the three-hour made-for-TV movie on ABC this evening at 8.
From one perspec tive, it can be seen - thanks largely to a solid cast and Glenn Jordan's carefully measured direction - as a shrewdly constructed film that manages to draw inspiration, prime time's equivalent of mother's milk, from tragedy: the horrifying explosion of the space shuttle Challenger on Jan.


Beyond Artificial Intelligence, the Search for Artificial Life
LEAD: COMPUTER viruses devised by high-technology vandals have crippled computer networks, damaged data and occasionally left personal computer users in a state of near hysteria.

Why Teach Manipulation?
LEAD: To the Editor:


WHEN BRITISH JUSTICE FAILED
LEAD: Court No. 2 of the somber Old Bailey Courthouse in London was packed to capacity last Oct. 19.
Ranks of wigged lawyers squeezed into the jury box.
A hundred reporters crowded the back benches; the public gallery was overflowing - but the courtroom was deathly silent.
As the Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Lane, finished his summing up, his voice, quiet and restrained, carried to the back of the courtroom: ''These appeals are allowed and the convictions are quashed.

LEAD: A fisherman from the south of Vietnam who said the Communist Government in Hanoi forced him to clear mine fields and gather grenades by hand gained permission today to challenge the way this British colony decides the fate of tens of thousands of boat people.


Kabobs and Breads of Lucknow

In a broader sense it is ascribed to anyone who appreciates good living and delights in gastronomic pleasures.
Ask any kabobi-sharabi for the best in the world for kabobs and he will invariably point to Lucknow, the capital of Northern Province and the home of the great

LOW-PRICED SPEAKERS DISPLAY VIRTUES

LEAD: The man who took television to new lows has reached one himself.
Morton Downey Jr., whose syndicated Morton Downey Jr.
Show was generally considered the prototype of ''shock television,'' filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in Federal Court in New Jersey last week.

Correction

He is a past chairman and a longtime member of the commission, not its founder.

That sense of propriety, of the materials that are called for, is the quality that makes something beautiful.''

YEARNING FOR AN IRON HAND
LEAD: Bill Keller's account of Russian nationalism brought to memory tales of the Russian past on which I was weaned (''Russian Nationalists: Yearning for an Iron Hand,'' Jan. 28).
My Russian-born father would tell us about the events of the 1905 pogrom, when Cossacks broke into his home.
My grandmother hid him in a wardrobe closet and covered him with blankets to save him from the drunken attackers, who beat her furiously, with cries of ''Kill the Yids and save Mother Russia.


Soccer Leagues Merge
LEAD: The American Soccer League and the Western Soccer League have been merged into the American Professional Soccer League for marketing and business purposes.


Looking Good Under Pressure
LEAD: WHere are women in the world whose mascara never smudges.
Their lipstick never blurs, their noses never shine, their hair never droops or sags.
Or maybe it does, but we never see it.
The point is this: They don't spend hours planted before the mirror, fussing, primping and retouching their makeup.

MAKING A HOUSE A HOME
LEAD: Walking through London's Eaton or Belgrave Squares, it seems as though life hasn't changed since these residential neighborhoods were orignally built in the early years of the 19th century.

A STORY OF LOVE OR A TALE OF DECEIT?
LEAD: The outcome of the trial, for or against, George Gardner is not the issue of my distaste for the story by David Margolick.

LEAD: More than 500 Penn State University students spent 48 hours in a campus gym last weekend dancing for charity, and walked away with sore feet on Sunday night after raising $671,572 for children with cancer.

A CHILD'S GARDEN OF SUBVERSION
LEAD: There exists in our world an unusual, partly savage tribe, ancient and widely distributed, yet until recently little studied by anthropologists or historians.
All of us were at one time members of this tribe: we knew its customs, manners and rituals, its folklore and sacred texts.
I refer, of course, to childhood.


Can a Dictator Tell Us Something About Ourselves?

Westling dashed off a letter sternly apprising her of his disapproval.


Tribal Feuds Won't Let Up in South Africa's East
LEAD: Thandabantu David Ntombela is the headman at Elandskop, a Zulu community 60 miles west of Durban.

LEAD: IT took 10 years to produce ''Disasters of War'' and another 43 to publish the series of etchings.

Tex-Mex Lights Up Great Neck
LEAD: BLAZING pink neon signs herald Cesar's Cafe in Great Neck.
Also stopping traffic are the giant cacti seemingly flourishing in the ice of winter outside this Tex Mex-Southwestern restaurant. (Only after two or three touch tests does it become apparent that they are not real.) Cesar's interior is a match for its outside flash and dash.


Bridgeport is Fighting Its 'Dump City' Image
LEAD: WALKING along the wintry shoreline of Seaside Park in Bridgeport, William Garrett paused to study the statue of the showman and entrepreneur P. T. Barnum, once the city's Mayor.

YEARNING FOR AN IRON HAND
LEAD: An addendum to your article: I've been told that Russian emigres to Israel are reporting that, to gain admittance to Pamyat, prospective members must provide the organization with the names, addresses and phone numbers of several Jews.

LEAD: Anti-Semitic incidents continue to plague Middlesex County, N.J.

Of course: the dashing staircase rippling with prestigious entrances!


Pastimes;   Camera

Wall Street;   A Coming Money Manager Shakeout
LEAD: While most people think of mutual funds and retirement accounts as something to invest in, the ''money management'' industry sees them as consumer products, like six-packs of beer or bottles of shampoo.
And, heaven knows, money management has been a good business over the past 15 years, as household financial assets have grown sharply and the share of those assets under professional management has expanded as well.

LEAD: Nearing completion on the same site in Morningside Heights is a 200-seat chapel for the Seventh Church of Christ, Scientist, and a 71-unit condominium called Lionsgate.

Hers;   Going Off The Deep End
LEAD: I didn't take swimming lessons because of my 40th birthday.
I'd like to blame it on that, but it isn't true.

She already hated the water as much as I did.

Schweitzer, not Dr.


THE LIBERATED LINE
LEAD: Whatever it is this season, it's easier.
Whether it's the shape of the clothes themselves or the attitude about how and where you wear them, the lines are freer now.

Cambodia Will Talk Again, But Listeners Are Scarce
LEAD: THE last time the warring factions in Cambodia sat down together at an international peace conference, in Paris last August, they seemed incapable even of holding a civil conversation.
The world's diplomats concluded that the conference had been premature and that flexibility toward a solution, let alone its shape, would have to come after the warring sides had done some more fighting in the absence of Vietnamese troops.


Baseball Deadlock Is Nearing
LEAD: Baseball's labor dispute could be only one meeting away from disrupting the start of the regular season.

Let Business Be Responsible
LEAD: To the Editor:


Food;   Homecoming
LEAD: When I was a small child in Chicago, my mother began what became a repeated chant: we must return one day to gu xiang, ''the village of our ancestors.'' She became more urgent with time as she began to fear she would be too old to make the journey.
And when China opened to travelers in 1978, my mother's determination grew.

THE POSTHUMOUS ADVENTURES OF LOUIS KAHN
LEAD: These are heady days for the memory of Louis I. Kahn.
The architect died 16 years ago next month, perhaps the most respected presence in his profession.

Some Small Joys On New Disks Of Italian Operas
LEAD: At hand are the five newest major-label recordings of mainstream Verdi and Rossini operas, and there is no use in delaying the report that all five are unsatisfying.

No One Wants Affordable Housing
LEAD: I think it is very humorous when pro-development speakers invoke affordable housing to justify the latest development action.
Who is kidding whom?


Mexico's Dismal Debt Deal
LEAD: The jury is now in on the 1989 debt restructuring agreement between Mexico and the international financial community.
Unfortunately, the deal is a bad one for Mexico.

LEAD: There is one mail fraud that seems to persist despite a year-long effort by the United States Postal Service to halt it.


More Than Counting Heads

No Longer Faces in a Crowd
LEAD: They were but faces in the crowd two years ago, among hundreds of young athletes trying to make the United States Olympic track and field team.
And like so many whose forays ended too soon, they disappeared again into the background, left to ponder the what-ifs and train for future glories.

Review/Dance;   Monson's Designed Improvisations
LEAD: Jennifer Monson called her new group work ''Ursa's Door,'' but the hint of mythology in the title and the set was not fulfilled in the dance itself, which was presented on Thursday night by the Danspace Project at St.
Mark's Church.
Instead, six personable, daredevil performers tumbled, dashed and teetered through a funny, often dramatic hourlong carnival of wild physical games.


UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: Czechoslovakia;   SOVIETS PREPARE CZECH DEPARTURE
LEAD: ''Glory to the Soviet Union!'' proclaims a red banner slung across the gates to the Soviet command in Czechoslovakia, situated in this small town less than 20 miles northeast of Prague.

Center Stage for Sushi and Sashimi
LEAD: KOTOBUKI in Stamford, which opened to some acclaim five years ago, has become better and better.
The sushi and sashimi offerings are just as sparklingly fresh, and the variety has expanded considerably.

LEAD: As members of the Ossining Ministerial Association who have worked on the Affordable Housing Proposal for Ossining for more than two-and-a-half years, we appreciated the article ''Divergent Goals Collide at River Site Owned by State'' [Feb. 4] .
While the need for affordable housing seems all too obvious to many of us, there are still some who question such initiatives, especially if it is in their neighborhood.


Review/Dance;   Elbow-Raising Debut By Feld and Scarlatti
LEAD: ''Ah Scarlatti'' was the premiere by Eliot Feld Thursday night on his company's second program.

To Know Berliners, Know Their Cafes
LEAD: IN West Berlin, where only 45 years ago Allied soldiers could execute a man for being on the street without his I.D. card, the conundrum of identity - of who you are when you're not at home - has never quite been solved.
It's the riddle at the heart of this schizophrenic city, yanked at from every quarter by contradicting tugs, and one that Berliners express in their choice of cafes.


WHEN THE NILE MET THE MISSISSIPPI
LEAD: Egyptomania in American decorative arts lingered longer than most revival styles, lasting from the Civil War until World War II.
Temple-shaped clocks and sphinx-embellished coffee urns proliferated in the nation's parlors and dining rooms while children learned their A B C's with obelisks of alphabet blocks.

LEAD: A GRADUAL realignment is under way in New York City in the ownership of renter-occupied apartments in co-op buildings.


Galloping Gamay
LEAD: Sonoma-Cutrer, a prominent California winery, uses one grape and makes only one wine from it: chardonnay.
In this respect, Sonoma-Cutrer is unusual.
Many wineries make only one wine, but they use a number of grapes to do it.
For example, a Bordeaux chateau like Lafite-Rothschild makes only one wine, the world-famous red that bears its name, but it may use three, four or even five different grapes, in varying proportions.

LEAD: To the Editor:


Reagan Testifies, For Better or Worse
LEAD: RONALD REAGAN was on television again, unfazed but unable to remember.
He had meant the Iran-contra operation to be covert but not illegal, he said in the videotaped deposition that John M. Poindexter, the next defendant to stand trial in the scandal, had sought for so long.
Mr.
Reagan could not recall conversations from his Presidency or even identify the Chairman of his Joint Chiefs of Staff.

World Markets
LEAD: The Japanese stock market was in all but free fall last week, dropping 2,569.35 points, or 6.9 percent.
One culprit was that old bugaboo - computerized program trading, one of the few unrestricted American imports into Japan.
And most of the program trading is being done by American firms, Japanese analysts say.


UNITING LOW POWER AND EFFICIENCY
LEAD: Paul MacCready is best known as the creator of the Gossamer Albatross, which flew across the English Channel under human power in 1979.
It was followed by other flights of low-power, high-efficiency aircraft.
The inventor even developed a flying dinosaur replica, one of many exploits that have inspired admiration for Dr.


Marijuana Dealer Doomed
LEAD: A Malaysian court today sentenced a man to hang for trafficking in marijuana but acquitted his wife, saying that she did not know about the 21 ounces of marijuana that the authorities found in their home.
The condemned man, Abdullah Zawawi Yusoff, 41 years old, became the 248th person sentenced to death for drug trafficking since 1975.


Goblins Obscure Views of Youth
LEAD: BUCKING the tide, swimming upstream, is as much a part of the mission of social agencies today as is serving people in great need.

France on 1,500 Calories a Day
LEAD: THERE must be a way to visit France and not gain weight; otherwise, there would be nothing but fat Frenchmen.
Over the years my bulk increased with each vacation until I reached 233 pounds - a very uncomfortable weight, even for a man of 6 feet 2.
Then, working with a colleague who specializes in clinical nutrition,

Auto-Leasers Look to a New Market

George Brainard Lucas Jr. of Watchung, N.J., have announced May wedding plans for their daughter Elizabeth Ann Lucas and Garret Walker Vreeland, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Pastimes;   Coins
LEAD: A nice collection can begin and end with just one type of coin.
A great coin to collect is the Franklin half dollar.
Many dealers concur and feel that now is the time for purchasing Franklin half-dollars.
Their reasoning is that there are only 35 varieties from 1948 to 1963 so a complete collection is not going to be a huge endeavor.


A May Wedding For Holly Adam
LEAD: May wedding plans for Elizabeth Hollister Adam and Charles Francis Smithers 3d, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Smithers Jr. of New Canaan and Niantic, Conn., have been announced by the prospective bride's parents, Dr.

A STORY OF LOVE OR A TALE OF DECEIT?
LEAD: I should say, first, that Patricia Nicely was my closest friend in Washington during the 25 years we both lived there (''A Story of Love or a Tale of Deceit?'' by David Margolick, Jan. 28).
I last saw her in Roanoke, Va., a year before she died.
I visited Pat in the nursing facility, went to lunch with George Gardner and her and spent the afternoon alone with her in


Lifestyle;   A Country Club With Guns Instead of Golf Clubs
LEAD: Imagine this.
A date takes you to a posh private club in the Wall Street area.
The atmosphere's cozy: forest green leather love seats, beige carpeting, white oak-paneled walls that discreetly hide private lockers, cable television, and soothing contemporary music piped in from a compact disc player.


A Bounty of Egyptian Imagery
LEAD: WHERE revivals were concerned, the Classical and Gothic styles had no competition until late in the 18th century, when there developed an interest in Egypt.
Ancient though the civilization was, few Europeans knew more of it than what could be gleaned from the classical writers and the Bible.
But this was the Romantic era and its figurehead, Napoleon, put Egypt back on the map by invading it and beating the Turks at the Battle of the

Once an Epic and Still One - Almost
LEAD: Some classic films have appeared on video in the past year, ranging from an unlikely, large-scale prospect such as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (RCA/Columbia, $29.95) to THE WIZARD OF OZ (MGM/UA, $24.95), already so familiar from television that a video version scarcely seems to make a difference.
But the classic least likely to survive the transition is GONE WITH THE WIND (MGM/UA, $89.95; two cassettes).


LINDA FAIRSTEIN VS. RAPE
LEAD: Linda Fairstein - suburban born, classically educated, intelligent, impeccably dressed - spends her days thinking about vile and abominable acts.

Threading Fish Tape
LEAD: THREADING electrical cable behind walls to extend existing circuits or to add new ones is seldom easy.
But stiff, tempered-steel tape called fish tape is the tool designed for the job and professional electricians rely on it.
Fish tape is also used to route cable through conduit.


Abstraction Returns to Haunt Photography
LEAD: After a hiatus of more than 30 years, the specter of abstraction once again haunts the art of photography.
But today's version of abstract photography has little in common with the Abstract Expressionist style and high seriousness of work from the 1950's by Aaron Siskind, Minor White and others.
Instead, it seems suffused with a sense of belatedness and loss, as well as an acute awareness that abstraction functions as a sign of the realm of the spiritual.


Catherine Kuehn Weds Malcolm Price
LEAD: Catherine Elizabeth Kuehn and Malcolm Keith Price were married yesterday at the Episcopal Church of the Heavenly Rest in New York by the Rev.

It's Troika Time at the Philharmonic
LEAD: It is not often that good luck comes disguised as a calamity.
That, however, may be what is happening to the New York Philharmonic in its efforts to replace Zubin Mehta as music director.
Having failed to induce Leonard Bernstein, its laureate conductor, to return to his old post with the orchestra and having lost out to the Berlin Philharmonic for the services of the next-best candidate, Claudio Abbado, Philharmonic officials have been flirting with a variety of more or less promising possibilities.


Further Views On the Turnpike
LEAD: As a frequent driver on the New Jersey Turnpike and the parent of a Rutgers University student who has taken courses taught by Professors Gillespie and Rockland, I compliment them on their entertaining, informative book on the turnpike.
But I must temper my compliments with criticism.


Camp Safety: What to Ask
LEAD: CHILDREN evolve into independent travelers in progressive steps, and one of the most significant is the first stay at sleep-away camp.
Parents who have focused on keeping children in seat belts, getting them to wear bicycle helmets and enforcing other travel safety precautions suddenly envision a world of hazards over which they have no control.


Pastimes;   Bridge
LEAD: Why has the number of student bridge players, once considerable in every college, dwindled to a trickle in the United States?

These tiny members of the legume family are delicious, versatile and easy to prepare.
Unlike most dried beans, they do not require presoaking.


City Ballet's Season: Steady Hand, Even Keel
LEAD: The New York City Ballet season was fairly unexciting, a phenomenon that would have once been gratefully regarded as stability -by those concerned about the company's survival in its early days and immediately after the death in 1983 of its co-founder, George Balanchine.


Campus Life: U.C., Santa Barbara;   In Popular Class, Lessons Concern The Vietnam War

Question Of the Week;   Does Tyson Deserve An Immediate Rematch?
LEAD: Absolutely not.
It is incumbent upon the champion to fight the No. 1 contender.
While this may not be in Douglas's best monetary interest, he should preserve the integrity of the sport.
Holyfield deserves the next shot.

Ban Leaves Only a Whisper of Canton's Evils
LEAD: Three men loitered on a dark street near Haizhu Bridge late one evening, whispering discreetly to young passers-by: ''Do you want to buy a Hong Kong video?
Uh, about sex?
Only 100 yuan.'' When the steep price, about $21, or more than a third of a worker's income here, was rejected, the men darted silently back into the darkness.


Lovers of Graffiti Rally To Save an Old Bridge

A Mexican Shrine Where Angels Soar
LEAD: DOZENS of soaring angels, saints and other religious figures form a baroque tapestry in stone on the colonial Church of San Francisco Javier, which dominates the plaza of the village of Tepotzotlan, about 25 miles north of Mexico City.
In the distance rises the Hill of the Hunchback, which gave the pre-Columbian town its


Good Workers Respect Tools
LEAD: While I read with interest the article on ''Things of Value: Worker or Tools?'' I found myself at odds with the writer's theme.
My experience as both a lumber-truck driver and a public-works crew driver, while different than the machinist, had certain parallels.


Port Authority's Incinerator Role Questioned
LEAD: A $300 MILLION solid-waste incinerator being built in Essex County with fund provided by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is drawing criticism on environmental and financial grounds as the massive waste-to-energy plant nears completion.

LEAD: Maxim Dlugy uttered the all-too-frequent grandmasters' lament, ''Oh, the won games I let get away!'' musing on the Hoogoven International Tournament in Wijk-aan-Zee, the Netherlands, which ended Jan. 28.
But the Englewood, N.J., grandmaster, who originally hailed from the Soviet Union, also got a small piece of good fortune.


Why Was Sharpton Marching in Yonkers?
LEAD: WHY would Al Sharpton come to Yonkers?
That's the first thought that came to my mind when I read that the black activist, who lives in Brooklyn, was coming here to protest the city's long opposition to building equally dispersed low-income housing to spur integration.


6 TORAHS STOLEN FROM SYNAGOGUES
LEAD: Six Torahs have been stolen this month from synagogues in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and the authorities say they suspect that there is a ring specializing in religious objects.


Holocaust Books For Children
LEAD: With all due respect and admiration for David A.

Vintage Popular Music Gets Classical Respect

New Yorkers, etc.
LEAD: Not too long ago a woman sent a very nice and rather expensive flower arrangement to a male friend who was in the hospital.
Days passed and she heard nothing.

LEAD: TO all the other environmental hazards connected with homeownership - radon, asbestos and foam insulation among them - must now be added underground oil tanks.


Western Europe Is Edgy Over the U. S. and Much Else
LEAD: AFTER 40 years in an alliance held together by the Soviet military threat, the United States and Western Europe have suddenly realized that things may never again be the same between them.
When Cold War issues dominated, Western Europe never questioned Washington's leadership.
Today, trans-Atlantic ties are being pulled in all directions.


Mixed Reviews
LEAD: For Joseph F. Cullman 3d, the scenario had to be one of the oddest of his 77 years.

Like a tennis net, Cullman was straddling both courts.


SPIES &amp; THRILLERS
LEAD: In THE GOOD SPY by John Griffiths (Carroll &amp; Graf, $17.95), the setting looks back a few years to the Brezhnev period.
A Russian sleeper in the United States is called into service.

There is a good deal of maneuvering before things are straightened out, to the satisfaction of all concerned.


As Co-ops Spread, Discrimination Concerns Grow
LEAD: AS more and more rental buildings in Brooklyn and Queens are converted into cooperatives, New York City's Commission on Human Rights is gearing up to tackle one of the stickiest of housing discrimination issues - the broad powers of co-op boards to reject would-be buyers without explanation.


New York State Issue Comes to Market

LEAD: Young pro-independence militants are exercising increasing influence in the Vale of Kashmir, cutting the support for traditional pro-Indian groups and leaving mainstream politicians isolated and silent.


Review/Theater;   'Burner's Frolic' Continues Fuller's Cycle
LEAD: With ''Burner's Frolic,'' the fourth in Charles Fuller's continuing cycle of plays about black Americans in the second half of the 19th century, one has a clearer picture of the playwright's ambitious intention.
Through a series of episodes, seemingly tangential in the sweep of American history, the playwright is scrutinizing the economic entrapment of people forced to weigh their pragmatic needs against their desire for complete emancipation and integration.


Further Rises in Rates Expected
LEAD: Upward pressure on interest rates in Japan and West Germany is expected to continue to influence the domestic credit rate structure this week and in the near future.


Agents Fight for Share Of Foreign Book Rights
LEAD: Lynn Nesbit, a literary agent, is selling Tom Wolfe's next book around the world.
