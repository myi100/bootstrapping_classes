Baseball Files Charges Over Bonilla and Franco Threat
Less than a week after Bobby Bonilla and John Franco made threatening comments about the fate other players faced if they became strikebreakers next spring, the owners' labor relations committee yesterday filed an unfair labor practice charge against the two Mets' players and their union.
In taking the action, the owners matched the Players Association in charges to the National Labor Relations Board.
The union filed an unfair labor practice charge on Sept. 6 over the owners' failure to make a $7.8 million payment to the players' pension and benefit plan on Aug. 1.


New Help Planned for Homeless Veterans
Recognizing that thousands of homeless, mentally ill veterans were missing out on Federal benefits and services, city, state and Federal officials are planning a new effort to find and assist veterans with housing and psychiatric needs.
The program, to be announced today, will assist up to 300 veterans with mental illnesses in its first year, said a spokesman for New York State's Office of Mental Health.
The state will spend $3.7 million in the first year of the program, and the Federal Department of Veterans Affairs will send workers into the streets and to city shelters to help identify eligible veterans.


Biogen Gives Up on a Drug And Takes Sizable Charge
In the fifth major setback for a biotechnology company in a month, Biogen Inc. said yesterday that it would not seek marketing approval for one of its most important drugs, Hirulog, because clinical trials had failed to show the drug to be more effective than an existing drug.
Biogen also said it took a $25 million charge against its third-quarter financial results to account for discontinuing Hirulog, an anti-clotting drug designed to be used in conjunction with angioplasty.
The charge contributed to most of the company's $26.4 million quarterly loss, which was also reported yesterday.


Baltimore Orioles Hire Syd Thrift
SYD THRIFT, let go earlier this month by the Chicago Cubs, was hired yesterday by the Baltimore Orioles as the team's director of player development.
Thrift will be in charge of the Orioles' minor league operations.
He replaces DOUG MELVIN, who left Baltimore to become general manager of the Texas Rangers.
Thrift, 65, has been general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, director of player personnel for the Oakland Athletics and senior vice president of the Yankees.
He had been assistant general manager of the Cubs, but was let go after ANDY MacPHAIL was hired as team president.


AIDS Drugs Fail to Curb Dementia and Nerve Damage
DESPITE widespread use of drugs to combat the AIDS virus, which earlier studies had shown to protect against infections that affect the brain and central nervous system, the incidence of such damage is increasing among those with the disease, a new study from a large Federal AIDS project has found.
The study looked at six AIDS-related neurological conditions among 2,641 H.I.V.-infected gay men in Baltimore, Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles who have participated in a long-term project directed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
The study was conducted by a team of researchers headed by Dr.
Justin S. McArthur, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.

Supreme Court Roundup SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; Justices Agree to Consider if University Should Finance a Student Religious Magazine
Accepting a case at the intersection of free speech and religion, the Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether a state university must subsidize student-run religious publications if it gives other student publications financial support.
The case is an appeal by a Christian student group at the University of Virginia, where more than 100 student organizations and a dozen publications get subsidies.
Under guidelines that bar financing for religious organizations, the student council in 1991 turned down the Christian students' request for $5,900 to publish a magazine founded to discuss "biblical Christianity" at the university.

Food Stake To Be Sold By Nabisco
The RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation took a big step yesterday that some analysts predicted would lead to an eventual separation of its food operations and its tobacco business.

Proceeds from the initial public offering, expected to be as much as $1 billion, would be used to pay off debt.

Data Give Tangled Picture of World Climate Between Glaciers
COULD a small push nudge the relatively benign and stable world climate of the last 10,000 years into abrupt and frequent cycles of warmth and extreme cold?
The question is far from academic, some scientists say, given the possibility that heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide could destabilize today's climate system.
The climate of the last interglacial period, which at least in its early stages was somewhat warmer than the present interglacial period, fluctuated widely in spans of decades or even less, scientists reported 15 months ago on the basis of climatic changes recorded in corings taken from the Greenland ice cap.
But six months later, another group of scientists analyzing another Greenland ice sample suggested that the last interglacial period, which began around 130,000 years ago and lasted 10,000 years by most reckonings, appeared stable after all.
They said the first ice sample apparently had been distorted when the bottom of the flowing glacier from which it was taken passed over uneven ground.


Were Asteroids Falling? Few Viewers Cared
A CBS television movie that tried to emulate the spooky verisimilitude of Orson Welles's "War of the Worlds," while avoiding the mass panic that radio drama engendered, left some viewers confused on Sunday night, others irritated and many more totally unmoved.
"Without Warning," a movie about asteroids striking Earth, was presented in the form of live news coverage.
It prompted several hundred calls to CBS's main offices in New York.

Mexican Drops Plan to Buy Most Westin Hotels
An ambitious young Mexican entrepreneur has abandoned his plan to purchase most of the Westin hotel chain for $708 million.
The entrepreneur, Bernardo Dominguez Cereceres, said today that he and his group of investors were pulling out of the deal because of rising interest rates, volatility of high-yield bond markets and Westin's inability to achieve the rates of return they had projected when the purchase was announced in February.


Republican Comptroller Candidate Denounced as Racist

New League Plans Partnership for Clubs and Players
Learning a lesson from Major League Baseball, the United Baseball League, which will be unveiled today, plans to begin with a "true partnership" between clubs and players.
The league, according to its confidential proposal, will offer players 35 percent of a team's pretax profits and a 10 percent equity share in all teams collectively.
Founders of the league, which would be the first new major baseball league in 80 years, will announce its creation at a news conference in Manhattan today.
The proposal, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, lists the co-founders as Bob Mrazek, a former five-term Congressman from Long Island; John Bryant, a Congressman from Dallas; Richard Moss, a player agent, and Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College.

Little distinction was drawn between members of Hitler's armed SS legions and ordinary Germans whose families had lived for centuries in places like Silesia, West Prussia and Pomerania that were wrested from German control by the wartime Allies in 1945.

And they maintain that a memorandum written this month by Alice M. Rivlin, the budget director, shows how the Clinton Administration is contemplating large tax increases and deep reductions in Social Security.

Chess; Boris Gulko, at 47 the oldest entrant, pours on the combinations to win the U.S. Championship.
Boris Gulko, a Fair Lawn, N.J., grandmaster, won the 1994 United States Championship last week in Key West, Fla., and along with it a place in the next stage of the International Chess Federation's world championship series.
A former Soviet champion, Gulko was a dissident who survived several hunger strikes before he was allowed to leave the Soviet Union in 1986.
In Key West, he scored 9 1/2-3 1/2 to capture the $8,000 first prize, given by Interplay Productions, makers of the Battle Chess CD-Rom and main sponsor of the event.
The grandmasters Larry Christiansen of Boston and Yasser Seirawan of Seattle ended in a tie for second and third places.
Each scored 8-5 and each was awarded $3,000.
Fourth, fifth and sixth places were shared by the grandmasters Joel Benjamin of Manhattan, Alexander Shabalov of Pittsburgh and Alexander Yermolinsky of Edison, N. J., who scored 7 1/2-5 1/2.

The Wizard of Eyes: Evolution Creates Novelty by Varying the Same Old Tricks
ONE of the most fascinating yet awkward problems that have challenged biologists since Charles Darwin is how to explain the evolution of complex structures like the eye and the wing.
How does a blind force like natural selection sculpture from almost nothing a supremely delicate mechanism like the inner structure of the ear?
The trick, so hard to understand, is one that apparently gives evolution no bother.
The eye, for instance, is an organ that has evolved not once but perhaps dozens of times, since insects, octopuses, mammals and other groups all have eyes of quite different structure.


U.S. to Spend $80 Million To Restore a Barrier Island
Ending 20 years of litigation, the Federal Government has agreed to spend $80 million to help restore a barrier island in the Hamptons where more than 200 homes were swept away in a 1992 storm.
The agreement, which was filed this afternoon in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, settles a lawsuit brought by residents of West Hampton Dunes, which was nearly washed into the Atlantic during the storm, in December 1992.

Whitman Approves Stringent Restrictions on Sex Criminals
Convicted sex offenders in New Jersey will now be subject to lifetime supervision under a package of laws signed today by Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman.
Critics, particularly civil libertarians, say that the bills, among the nation's toughest, contain more symbolism than substance and are heading for a certain constitutional challenge.
Even as she signed the nine-bill package, known as Megan's Law, Mrs.
Whitman acknowledged that keeping a tight rein on sex offenders after they have completed their sentences presents legal problems.
But she added: "It would be hollow justice if we wrote laws to protect families and communities only to have those laws struck down in the courts. I am confident this package will pass constitutional muster."

She referred to the cut as "Bikini atoll," and said, "This is Draconian."

Reynolds's appeal of a ruling last May by a Federal appeals court that overturned his 1992 judgment against the international governing body of track and field.

Harsh Report on Iran Opposition Group Draws Ire in Congress
The State Department upset many members of Congress today by issuing a scathing report about a prominent Iranian opposition group without meeting with officials from the group, as more than 100 lawmakers had asked it to do.
Brushing aside Congressional pleas to get the views of the People's Mujahedeen, the State Department concluded that the armed resistance group engages in terrorism inside and outside Iran and is closely allied with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.

Mexican Candidate's Assassin Is Sentenced to 42 Years
The 23-year-old factory worker who admitted that he shot and killed Mexico's leading presidential candidate in March was convicted of murder today and sentenced to 42 years in prison.

Nine Years of Resolve; Trial to Begin in a Daughter's Death
Libby Zion's death in 1984 at New York Hospital was not going to be just another unexplained tragedy, soon forgotten by almost everyone.
Her father, Sidney Zion, would see to that.
For more than a decade, Mr.
Zion, a writer, has been possessed by a desire for retribution, a need to put on trial the hospital, a few doctors and a decades-old medical culture that routinely put patients in the hands of doctors with little experience, supervision or sleep.


Rivers's Healing Status May Ease Knicks Logjam
Doc Rivers said today that he expects to begin the season on the injured list, temporarily helping the Knicks' overcrowded-roster problem.
The Knicks have 14 players with guaranteed contracts, but if Rivers joins Doug Christie, who is recovering from ankle surgery, on the injured list, New York could easily reach the 12-man limit by Wednesday's deadline.
Greg Butler, a free agent, is expected to be released.
The Knicks will also be forced to release Ron Grandison, a free-agent forward who has enjoyed an impressive preseason, unless another injury develops.

Dinosaur Jr.'s Clinic In Anesthesia Rock
There are a few things one should know about Dinosaur Jr., which played on Friday night at Roseland.
First of all, though it performs as a trio, the 10-year-old band currently exists only as a vehicle for the songs, solos and obsessions of its front man, the anti-hero of alternative rock guitar, J Mascis.
Mr.
Mascis is the crown prince of slackers: he functions at the lowest energy level possible in interviews, on the stage and in life.
Life, if one is to believe Mr.
Mascis' songs of dashed hopes and heartbreak, is an ever-widening wound that is best borne under heavy anesthesia.
On Friday, Mr.
Mascis summed up this philosophy best in "Feel the Pain," from his new album "Without a Sound" (Sire).
"I feel the pain of everyone," he sang in a cracking, sleepy voice.
"Then I feel nothing." The juxtaposition between these two extreme states seemed to be a guiding principle for Mr.
Mascis throughout the show.
Swift, dramatic shifts from noise to tunefulness, from fast tempos to slow ones, from simple guitar strumming to big drum bashing made for a show guided more by dynamics than by melody.


Green Point Savings Settles Depositor Suits
The Green Point Savings Bank of Flushing, Queens, said yesterday that it had settled a series of lawsuits by depositors challenging the bank's conversion to public stock ownership.
Under the settlement, the bank will send depositors a coupon for $500 off the closing costs of a mortgage and offer them the right to invest in a five-and-a-half-year certificate of deposit with an interest rate that is 65/100 of a percentage point higher than the bank is providing on its five-year account.

Almost Perfect Marathon Presence
The blue line that marks the 26.2- mile course will be interspersed with silver, and the sky will be full of red, white and blue tributes, but for all the embellishments of the 25th New York City Marathon on Sunday, to Arturo Montero it will just be more of the same.
No one has run all 24 races, but Montero, one of the 55 original finishers in 1970, comes close.
The 58-year-old Clairol mechanic from Stamford, Conn., has missed only one, he said yesterday, because of a hernia operation in 1982.


CHRONICLE
The word "righteous" does not often arise these days in connection with the British royal family.
But it was the key to an honor that PRINCE PHILIP, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, received in Jerusalem yesterday in the name of his mother, the late Princess Alice of Greece.
Princess Alice, a British noblewoman who married Prince Andrew of Greece early in the century, was designated a "Righteous Gentile" by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial organization in Jerusalem, for saving a Greek Jewish family from the Nazis during World War II.
The princess, who died in 1969, at 84, helped several family members escape and hid others for more than a year at one of her residences in Athens.

His fingerprints were then compared by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with those of Mr.
Finkelstein, who in the 1970's had used the name Robert Howard as an alias.

Giants Waiting for the Hard Times to Go
Embarrassed by the team's five-game losing streak, one Giants player said he was hesitant about calling his mother this week because every time he does she gives him an earful about what the team needs to do to win.
Another Giant gets almost three messages a week from friends around the league making fun of the team: "Beep. Nice squad, dude. Beep."
The losing is taking its toll, personally and professionally.
And while no one has given up on the season, the immediate future looks bleak.
Not only is confidence sagging and frustration growing, but the Giants have some key players who are banged up, and the Super Bowl champion Cowboys are waiting for a Monday night matchup in Dallas.


Rooney Faces Intoxication Charge
A former trainer for MIKE TYSON and LARRY HOLMES now working with VINNIE PAZIENZA was charged over the weekend with driving while intoxicated and assaulting a police officer.
KEVIN ROONEY, 38, of Catskill, N.Y., was pulled over in North Stonington, Conn., early Sunday morning for erratic driving, the state police said.
Rooney refused to take a sobriety field test.
As he was being handcuffed, Rooney forced Trooper JOHN PATTERSON to the ground and kicked him, the police said.

New York State Election Choices; State Legislative Races
Few incumbents face serious challenge this year, which reflects more on the state's closed political process than voter happiness with the State Legislature.
Here are our choices in some of the more interesting races in New York City and the surrounding suburbs.
SENATE -- 23d District, Brooklyn and Staten Island: Robert DiCarlo, a Republican who took this seat in a special election in 1993, now seeks a full two-year term.
He stresses that he is a valuable advocate for New York City during closed-door meetings of the Republican Senate majority.
But that value is diminished by his tendency to be a divisive force even within his own party.
We favor his Democratic challenger, Vincent Gentile, an Assistant District Attorney long involved in community and civic activities.


Pollution-Control Efforts Zero In on Pleasure Boats
Car exhaust has gotten cleaner and cleaner over the years, with catalytic converters and other refinements, but motorboat engines still have all the pollution controls of a '57 Chevy.
That would change under an accord announced yesterday by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The E.P.A. said it had reached agreement with marine-engine manufacturers to cut smog-producing hydrocarbon emissions by three-quarters, a step that would help reduce the blue haze that sometimes hangs over lakes and harbors on summer days.
Nitrogen oxides, the other major ingredient of smog, would also be cut sharply.

The Government said it would appeal the decision.
"We plan to appeal the judge's ruling to assure that Cubans wishing to return home can do so at the earliest possible moment," said a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice, Julie Bender.


Dublin Journal; Women's Movement in Ireland Slows to a Crawl
When a prominent leader of the women's movement, Frances Fitzgerald, was elected to Parliament two years ago, both her own career and the movement itself seemed on the rise in a conservative society where gains for women have been slower than elsewhere in Western Europe.
Ms.
Fitzgerald, a 44-year-old social worker who had been chairwoman of the Council for the Status of Women, an umbrella group, was touted even by some of the male politicians as someone who had the potential to become Prime Minister, a job no woman has had.

Iranian Writers Ask for an End To Censorship
A group of dissident Iranian writers has called for the abolition of censorship in Iran in an open letter sent to news organizations, saying, "Writers must be free to create their work and express themselves."
The letter was signed by 134 novelists, publishers and translators, who said again today that they would continue their campaign against censorship in any form.
The letter was sent last week to foreign news organizations and the state-run press.


Getting Ready for the Big Day


A Voice for the Voiceless That Still Thunders
"Frederick Douglass: When the Lion Wrote History" confirms its subject's crucial place in the struggle of America's blacks of his time even as it demonstrates his relevance more than a century after the end of slavery.
Tomorrow night's 90-minute appreciation draws on Douglass's own ringing words -- notably from his masterpiece, "Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Written by Himself" -- to tell the famous story of a young man who escaped to freedom and became a lifelong champion of his people and a hero for whites as well as blacks.
He was not only self-educated, with a love of language that should still be an inspiration to children of any race (he took his surname from Walter Scott's "Lady of the Lake"); he was also self-created.


Facing Social Problems: Proposals by Cuomo and Pataki Often Are Vague
In a gubernatorial campaign heavy with talk about crime and taxes, debate about the social problems that cost New Yorkers billions of dollars each year has been light.
Events like the recent visit of President Clinton focused attention momentarily on the issue.
Campaigning for his fellow Democrat, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, Mr.
Clinton said he would allow New York to begin experimental welfare programs and would press for improving Medicaid payments to the state.
But the welfare waiver would involve only 21,000 of the more than one million New Yorkers receiving welfare grants, and the Medicaid help would require Congressional approval that would be difficult to win.


Review/Fashion; The Incredible Lightness of Beene
In a season when many designers are so confused about what women want to wear in the 90's that they're looking backward for inspiration, Geoffrey Beene is, as always, looking ahead.
His mantra is "modern." His quest is for effortless, weightless clothes that allow freedom of movement.
To demonstrate his point, he's taken to having his shows choreographed on ballet dancers who leap around the stage.
He said he believed the spring collection he showed yesterday was the lightest he had ever designed.
With gossamer fabrics like paper taffeta, silk gazar, horsehair and chiffon, the clothes often appeared to float on air.

Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in subdued trading yesterday, with no follow-through buying from Friday's rally.
The market is again in the grip of the bearish tone that has held it for months, traders said.
The market was weighed down yesterday by a weak dollar and a coming supply of new Treasury securities, which offset the good news from sharp declines in precious metals and the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commoditites.

Over 100 Inmates Escape From Haiti's Main Prison
More than 100 prisoners at Haiti's national penitentiary, including some former police officers being held on charges of human rights abuses, escaped here Sunday, according to Haitian news reports.
International police monitors confirmed the jail break.
Only eight of those who escaped were reported to have been recaptured as of this afternoon.


Sir John Pope-Hennessy, 80, Art Expert, Dies
Sir John Pope-Hennessy, a former museum director, an authority on the Italian Renaissance and the head of European painting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1977 to 1986, died yesterday at his home in Florence.
He was 80.
The cause was complications from a liver ailment, said Alton Peters, Sir John's lawyer in New York City.


For Hunts, a Reckoning Is at Hand
Eight years ago, the Hunt brothers, Nelson Bunker and William Herbert, pitched their corporations into bankruptcy.
Six years ago, they declared personal bankruptcy.
But only late on Friday did the family of Herbert Hunt finally agree in a court filing to hand over the bulk of his property -- more than $40 million in real estate, with back interest, that creditors say he had fraudulently transferred shortly before filing for personal bankruptcy.
In August, Nelson Bunker Hunt's relatives quietly agreed to a similar settlement, worth about $14 million.

Ohio University Fires Head Coach
Ohio University's football coach, TOM LICHTENBERG, was fired yesterday, two days after his team dropped to 0-8 on the season.
Lichtenberg, in his fifth year at the university, will be reassigned in the athletic department after completing this season.
The team has three games left.
Ohio's president, ROBERT GLIDDEN, said Lichtenberg was not fired, but had asked for reassignment.
But at his weekly news media luncheon after the university's news conference, Lichtenberg said: "They don't want to say I got fired. And that's probably not the right word for it, but I didn't ask to give up the football job. In the press conference this morning, they said I asked to be reassigned. I did not ask to be reassigned."


New York State Election Choices; Karen Burstein for Attorney General
Both candidates in the race for state attorney general boast acceptable credentials.
The Republican, Dennis Vacco, is a former U.S.
Attorney in Buffalo.
The Democrat, Karen Burstein, has served as a state legislator, commissioner and judge.
Who would do the better job?
The clear answer is Ms.
Burstein, and we are pleased to endorse her.
Mr.
Vacco has an alarming vision of how he would use the office of attorney general.
He plans to emphasize fighting street crime, which is the job of local district attorneys.
In the process, he would necessarily slight the heavy responsibilities of the attorney general in administrative law and other unglamorous but essential kinds of legal work.
Mr.
Vacco also wants to use the office as a statewide platform to campaign for the death penalty.


Gag Rule Isn't Part Of G.O.P. 'Contract'

Psychiatric Exam Ordered In White House Shooting
The dishonorably discharged Army medic who opened fire on the White House on Saturday with a semiautomatic rifle was today charged with four felony offenses, and a magistrate ordered him to undergo a one-day psychiatric examination.
At a hearing in Federal District Court, prosecutors charged the man, Francisco Martin Duran, with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, destruction of Federal property at the White House, assaulting a Federal officer during his arrest and using a firearm in the commission of violent crime.
If convicted of all four charges, he faces a maximum term of 35 years in prison.

WOMEN are more than twice as likely as men to become infected with the virus that causes AIDS during heterosexual sex, a study by an Italian research group reports.
The study, published in the November issue of the journal Epidemiology, provides further evidence that anatomical and physiological differences between the sexes make women more susceptible than men to contracting the virus, H.I.V.


Moynihan Foe Says Giuliani Pressured Her
Bernadette Castro, the Republican candidate for United States Senate, said yesterday that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani tried to persuade her during a private meeting at Gracie Mansion on Sunday night to "consider distancing" herself from her party's gubernatorial candidate, George E. Pataki.
Ms.
Castro, a long-time friend and financial contributor to the Mayor, told reporters at an impromptu news conference on Fifth Avenue that she refused.
"I'm a member of the Republican ticket," she said.
"George Pataki is the head of the ticket. If I didn't think he would be a good governor, I wouldn't have joined the ticket in the first place."


Questions Seen on Tests For Growth Mutations
NONE of the new studies of growth factor receptors are likely to lead to treatments for skeletal disorders any time soon.
Yet, because the mutations are unusually specific, designing genetic tests based on them should be quite easy.
Who should be allowed to use the tests is far less obvious.
In the case of achondroplasia, the main symptom of the mutation is short stature, though a minority may suffer from hunchback and compressed spinal column, which can lead to health problems.
Dr.
John J. Wasmuth of the department of biological chemistry at the University of California at Irvine said the only legitimate use he could see for the screening test was in those rare cases where there was a risk that a fetus might inherit not just one, but two copies of the dwarfism gene, an event that would be extremely deforming and eventually lethal.


Seiko Consolidates 2 Brands at Martin
The Seiko Corporation of America said yesterday that it had dismissed DDB Needham New York after less than a year handling its Seiko and Lassale watch brands by consolidating those brands, with billings estimated at $10 million, at the Martin Agency in Richmond, which handles Seiko's Pulsar brand.
Cheri McKenzie, Seiko's advertising director in Mahwah, N.J., said the consolidation was made when the company decided "that a single marketing partner would best support our new overall corporate strategy."

The bias-cut satin dress was last spring's surprise hit, crossing over from evening into day when worn under a jacket or sweater.
But satin is not just for dresses.
It was also used for jackets, pants, skirts, vests and shirts in the fall and resort collections.
It showed up in the spring '95 shows in Europe and is being seen in the New York spring shows that started over the weekend.
Henri Bendel has a wide selection of satin clothing and accessories.
Its private-label offerings include a long black bias-cut skirt, $88; a halter vest, $98; jeans in black, silver, brown or bronze, $160, and a shirt in black, magenta, red, yellow, purple, orange or royal, $98.

Wilkins, who averaged 14.3 points a game last season, ruptured the tendon in an exhibition game and will be out all season.

Two men wearing Halloween masks pistol-whipped a nanny outside a home in Flushing, Queens, and then fatally shot a 15-year-old boy in her charge yesterday as he rushed to help her, the police said.
Detective Kim Royster, a police spokeswoman, said the men were apparently robbers trying to force their way into the home at 63-23 136th Street, near Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, on a quiet street where children had been trick-or-treating just a few hours earlier.


McCall Seeks a Balance Of His Resume and Race
"I am very delighted to be here, because this is where it all started," H. Carl McCall, the state's comptroller, said the other day to a small crowd in the heart of Bedford-Stuyvesant.
"My very first job in New York was just a few blocks away from here on Bedford Avenue, at the Bedford Y.M.C.A. I came here as a social worker. Major Owens knows this. He was working in the library."
Mr.
McCall, 58, a Democrat locked in a tight race to hold onto his job, nodded from the platform to Mr.
Owens, now the five-term Representative from Brooklyn.
As Mr.
McCall ticked off the names of other local officials at the rally who are black, he told his audience something he normally does not: New York has never elected a state official who is black.

Croatian Serbs Send Troops to Counter Bosnian Offensive
The leader of the Serbs in Croatia said today that he had dispatched a special police and military unit to assist the Bosnian Serbs in recapturing territory lost in recent days to resurgent Bosnian Government forces from the northwestern town of Bihac.
Milan Martic, the president of the self-styled Serbian Krajina Republic that surrounds much of the Bihac pocket, said in an interview that the Serbian forces now massing would be sufficient to defeat the Muslim-led Bosnian Army, adding, "We will see if the Bihac pocket ends up smaller than it was before this offensive started."

A Woman With an Eye For Talent and Revolt
"Mother of All the Behans" is one of those celebrations of Irish lore, song and dance that often tend to leave the uninitiated feeling a bit left out.
Fortunately, the one celebrating is Rosaleen Linehan, who weaves the tale with such enchantment that she converts Kathleen Behan's rather ordinary life story into a one-woman music hall.
Ms.
Linehan, warmly remembered for her brilliant performance as Kate, the eldest sister, in Brian Friel's "Dancing at Lughnasa," has brought the show to the Irish Repertory Theater with such a twinkle of eye and toe that she makes the audience wish it had personally known her subject, if only better to appreciate her portrayal.

And on streets that were eerily vacant once darkness fell even two months ago, families take late-night walks to buy ice cream at parlors that have been able to reopen because they now have a regular supply of electricity.

Mr.
Mavrodi, 39, was arrested during a police raid on his apartment and spent 70 days in jail, without having been charged, on suspicion of tax evasion.
A court released him on Oct. 12 after his workers collected enough signatures for him to qualify as a candidate in the 109th electoral district, centered in Mytishchi, just north of Moscow.

He has had a productive year, working to reform Albany's dubious debt practices and successfully challenging the Governor and the Legislature on the misuse of pension funds for budget balancing.
In his oversight of city and state finances, Mr.
McCall has been responsible and constructive.

Plane Waiting to Land at O'Hare Crashes in Indiana, Killing 68
A twin-engine commuter airplane owned by a subsidiary of American Airlines, fighting a gusty rainstorm on the way to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, crashed yesterday in a cold Indiana soybean field.
All 68 people on board were killed, officials said.
The American Eagle flight from Indianapolis, nearly an hour behind schedule on the 164-mile trip to O'Hare, went down near Roselawn, Ind., four miles west of Interstate 65 and 30 miles south of Gary, Ind.
Leroy Prohosky, who lives on an adjacent farm, said he heard the plane's engines whining overhead like a dirt bike, then silence.

G.O.P. Defections Bare Party's Rift
A string of defections by prominent Republicans who endorsed Democratic candidates, the biggest in decades, has exposed an ideological rupture in the Republican Party and demonstrated how difficult it has become for the major parties to enforce discipline.
While it is not clear how much effect the endorsements will have on this year's state and Federal races, the fissure exposed by the desertions points to trouble ahead for Republicans as they first try to set legislative priorities for the next Congress and then field a nominee to oppose President Clinton in 1996.


DONNA KARAN GETS NEW $125 MILLION CREDIT LINE
The Donna Karan Company, the New York-based designer apparel and cosmetics company, said yesterday that it had received a new $125 million credit line from a group of five banks led by Citibank.
The new line replaces a $110 million credit line, which was originally set up as short-term financing to provide the company with funds during an initial public stock offering the company planned a year ago.
The offering was canceled when its business slowed, and the company has struggled to find new financing since.
The new credit agreement extends through 1998, which should alleviate the pressure on the company to find additional financing.

Another Shutout in the Progress League
Another Monday, another secret meeting, another report of no progress.
That's where the National Hockey League stood yesterday as it reached the end of the first month of the lockout of its players.
Negotiators for the league and the players' union met in Washington for about five hours and left no closer to an agreement than when they began.


Grace &amp; Rothschild Wins Mobil Account
The Mobil Corporation has expanded its agency roster again by selecting Grace &amp; Rothschild in New York to handle its Mobil 1 motor oil account, which had been at DDB Needham New York for more than 30 years.
Billings were estimated at $15 million.
John McCalla, a spokesman for Mobil in Fairfax, Va., confirmed yesterday a report of the selection this week in Adweek, adding that Grace &amp; Rothschild was awarded the account after a three-month review that was narrowed to that agency and Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro RSCG in New York.
A campaign is expected to begin early next year, he added.


Pfizer Obtains Namic and Its Chief
As a young computer programmer working on contract at the Namic U.S.A.

Indeed, in a dazzling ascent, she was hired to help develop new products at age 25, promoted to president at 29 and became chief executive at 31.
Yesterday, Pfizer Inc., the giant New York-based health care company, announced that it had agreed to buy Namic for about $155 million in Pfizer stock, or about $18 a share.

Giants' G.M. Is a Firm Believer: It's Better Not to Play It Again, Ref
The Giants have been victimized by several incorrect calls or no calls by officials in crucial situations in the last two weeks.
But that hasn't swayed George Young, the Giants' general manager, to change his stance against using instant replay as a means to reverse incorrect calls.
He's still against it.
"It doesn't solve the problem," Young said.
"You're just adding another layer of officials. You're trying to eliminate human error by adding more humans."

"We are all saying to new young acts that we want to sign: 'Look, it's not a stable environment over there. You won't get the attention you need.' "

Big Bang's Defenders Weigh Fudge Factor, A Blunder of Einstein's, As Fix for New Crisis
EVEN though the universe has infinite ways of humbling them, cosmologists are nothing if not resilient and endlessly creative.
They have to be, given their daunting task of standing on the shore of a small world and looking beyond the harbor lights of nearby stars to the arching waves of clustered galaxies, seeking on far horizons glimpses of the entire cosmic history, from beginning to probable end.
For more than three decades, their most satisfying reconstructions of that history have rested squarely on the "Big Bang" theory.
In the beginning, according to this model, mass was compressed into a state of infinite density, an initial singularity.
Then there was a kind of explosion.
Everything -- space itself -- expanded, thinned out and cooled.
At first, all was smooth and virtually uniform.
But around some faint wrinkles, called density fluctuations, matter began clumping into stars, galaxies of stars and clusters of gravitationally bound galaxies stretching across the sky.

Lottery's New Millionaire Says He's Keeping His Old Tastes
A $45,000-a-year toolmaker from an upstate village -- who bowls every Sunday night, has 130,000 miles on his truck and just borrowed money to finish a house he's worked on for ages -- gulped like a Frank Capra character at the television cameras and microphones yesterday and said aw, shucks, to the $18,125,000 New York Lottery jackpot he won over the weekend.
"I'm not going to change my life dramatically," the new millionaire, Fred Jacobs, 42, of Galway, N.Y., said at a crowded news conference at State Lottery headquarters in Schenectady.

Family of Errant Genes Is Found to Be Related To Variety of Skeletal Ills
FORGET the great human heart and brain, the eyes that see sweeping vistas, the lips that declare "I am"; the real thing standing between us and primordial ooze is the human skeleton.
Built of 206 bones, 29 in the skull alone, the skeleton is a living cathedral of ivory vaults, ribs and buttresses -- a structure at once light and strong, flexible and firm.
Yet like those toy kits requiring self-assembly, the skeleton is also so complicated that many things can and do go wrong with it during development.
Disorders that affect the growth of the body's bones are among the most common of all birth defects.
For example, at least one in 3,000 babies suffers from any of 100 different syndromes that cause the sutures of the skull plates to fuse prematurely.


Excesses With Medicaid: Hair Transplants?
State Senator George E. Pataki, the Republican candidate for governor, thinks it is terrible that Medicaid, the health-care program for the poor, would pay for hair transplants.
But would it?
"I think, personally, it's absurd that somebody can get a hair transplant paid for by Medicaid," Mr.
Pataki said recently in an interview with The New York Times.
He raised the example in an effort to underscore the excesses of Medicaid, which is expected to cost the state $5.9 billion this year, a cost that is debilitating the budgets of local governments that share state expenses for the federally mandated program.

Move to Ban Giant Bulls Splits Spain
From prehistoric cave paintings to Picasso murals, bulls have always been associated with Spain's national imagery.
Or so almost everyone in Spain is now passionately affirming since the Ministry of Public Works has condemned dozens of huge metal cutouts of bulls that dot the countryside.
Weighing more than four tons, they stand about 40 feet square and have loomed on hills, plains, cliffs, farmlands and vineyards since 1957 as advertisements for a brandy called Veterano.


Cadets See Aberration, Not Tailhook Scandal
For years, the United States Military Academy has conducted a half-dozen classes a semester on relations between men and women, including frank discussions of sexual harassment and incidents like the Tailhook scandal.

The incident, a half-dozen cadets said, should not be compared with the Tailhook scandal, which tarnished the image of the Navy's officers corps.


After Crackdown, Smugglers Of Chinese Find New Routes
More than a year after the tramp steamer Golden Venture went aground off Queens with a cargo of 300 illegal Chinese immigrants, a Government crackdown on the ship-borne smuggling of Chinese to this country has apparently led smugglers to open a new route through the Caribbean.
So far this year, only two large ships, together carrying just over 300 Chinese immigrants, have been intercepted on the high seas, a sign of the waning success of ship-borne smuggling.
More than a dozen ships were intercepted in the year before, yielding 2,533 arrests.

Czechs Celebrate Traditions Of the Other Classical Crucible
A disproportionately large fraction of the classical repertory stems from small Central European countries that have cultivated great music over the centuries in an intense greenhouse atmosphere.
Austria possesses the most illustrious of these everlasting traditions, but Czech musical history is nearly as remarkable.
The whole panorama of Czech music was celebrated in an absorbing daylong festival in the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center on Sunday.
The festival's title was "400 Years of Music in Prague"; Petr Kotik, director of the S.E.M.
Ensemble, chose the programs in collaboration with Petr Danek, the director of the annual Prague Spring Festival.
There has been at times a national sound in Czech music, but more important there has been an extraordinary diversity of accomplishment rooted in a single place.
As with the Austrian-Viennese tradition, it is really the tale of one city, a cultural colossus with music in its veins.

The police have said that a verbal dispute was involved, that no violence was reported and that no arrest was made.


Beating the Clock
Daylight is a gift of nature, but humans have successively taken it on themselves to measure, subdivide, standardize and even politicize nature's schedule.
Once the motive was to help ancient Egyptian farmers predict the annual Nile flood.
In modern times it is to synchronize everything from train schedules and prime-time television to working hours and private appointments.
Standardization has disconnected our clocks and our lives from strict local solar time as a sundial might measure it.
It has also increasingly put governments in charge of the clock.
That, along with increasing urbanization, made possible the 20th century's great leap forward in artificial time measurement -- daylight savings time.

"One time we were together, and I told him that I was scared to walk by this group of kids," said Ronnie Simmons, 15, who attended Holy Cross High School in Flushing with Joseph.
"He said, 'Don't worry, I got your back.' And I knew he meant it. He was like that."


Investment Adviser Settles Suit by S.E.C.
Galleon Capital Management of San Diego, until recently one of the largest minority-owned investment advisory firms, has settled a suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission accusing it of misappropriating clients' money through a complex arrangement of rebates from brokers who handled the firm's stock trades.
The settlement, announced yesterday, comes after most of the firm's largest clients had pulled their money from Galleon.
Those clients included the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the New York City Employees' Retirement Systems, and the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension Fund.
Some clients said they had moved their accounts because of poor investment results, but people familiar with the firm's operations said most defections came after clients became aware of the pending S.E.C. investigation.

America Can't Afford More Huddled Masses
To the Editor:
"Indecent Proposition in California" (editorial, Oct. 25) would have had a shred of credibility if you had any record in recognizing the negative impact immigration is having on cities and states.
In an era of sharp cutbacks in government services, and when entitlement programs soak up ever greater portions of government budgets, the net burden of high levels of immigration can no longer be supported.
The sentiments of Emma Lazarus's anthem -- to send us your huddled masses -- are simply no longer economically possible or desirable.
American incomes have been stagnant for the last 20 years.
The taxpaying population is in revolt and any new taxes to support transfer payments and new social programs are not politically feasible.
The impact of population growth on cities and states is demonstrable.
California estimates that the net cost of illegal immigration to the state's taxpayers is more than $3.5 billion.
In New York City, the school population has grown by more than 20 percent in the last three years, a phenomenon that is almost entirely immigration-driven.
While immigrants do contribute to the economy, their net impact is negative, especially if they cannot enter the more skilled professions.
As welfare reform becomes more urgent, the competition and friction between illegal immigrants and citizens who must integrate into the work force at lower skill levels will become more intense.
The country can no longer support the present legal immigration of 700,000 people annually, let alone illegal immigration levels that push total annual immigration into the millions.
Quality of life and environmental and economic realities dictate that even our current population of 260 million consumes too much of the earth's limited resources.
A halt to illegal immigration and a reduction of legal immigration are urgently needed.
If both can be accomplished, the natural birth rate of the United States will eventually reverse our population to more sustainable levels.
You place misty-eyed ideology before hard reality in attacking California's Proposition 187.
Some of its provisions may be unconstitutional, but its real import is that it is placing the question of out-of-control immigration policy squarely in the center of public discourse where it belongs.

Bond Prices Continuing To Retreat
Prices continued falling in the credit markets yesterday, as investors reacted to economic reports that showed rapid growth, portending future inflation.

America Can't Afford More Huddled Masses; Unworkable Proposal
To the Editor:
"Indecent Proposition in California" (editorial, Oct. 25) cites many good reasons for opposing the drive to bar illegal aliens from public services.
But your critique, focused like most others on policy issues, ignores the basic point that this whole discriminatory proposal is unrealistic, and should be rejected as unworkable.


Croats Appear Ready to Join Offensive by Bosnian Army
Commanders of Bosnian Croat militias appear to be readying troops and heavy artillery to join an advance by the Bosnian Army against a Serbian-held town in west central Bosnia, a United Nations official said.
The joint operation to capture the town, Kupres, would mark a new high point in the military alliance between the Muslim-led Bosnian Army and the Bosnian Croat militia just as Bosnian forces have made their most significant advances ever against the Serbs.
Bosnian Serbs still control about 70 percent of the country.


Class Notes
Very little is more in tune with popular fashion these days than the notion that private companies can provide public services -- from picking up garbage to educating children -- at higher quality and lower cost than public institutions.
Take the Edison Project, the high-profile, high-risk attempt of the media entrepreneur Christopher Whittle to revamp the nation's schools.
But if Edison's struggle to survive the collapse or sale of the rest of Mr.
Whittle's empire tells anything, it is that the prevailing "government bad, private enterprise good" formulation driving the nation's send-them-a-message politics can speak more to slogans than to solutions.

He had been in poor health for several years, said Robert B. Ford, a media relations manager at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., where Dr.
Fuller worked for 37 years before retiring in 1967.

The Talks Are Quiet, But Skates Are Sharp
No new talks were held or scheduled yesterday in the National Hockey League as the owner-ordered shutdown began its second month.
But several kettles continued to boil on the hot stove of an increasingly fragmented business.
In Toronto, the players' association announced rosters for a union-sponsored tournament, to be held next week, and prepared for a major membership meeting to be held there today.
Participants in the union games will include Glenn Healy of the Rangers; Ray Ferraro and Benoit Hogue of the Islanders, and Stephane Richer and Claude Lemieux of the Devils.


PATAKI REVERSES STAND ON DEBATE AS CUOMO DEMURS
Reversing his position that he would debate Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo in a one-on-one session only, State Senator George E. Pataki, the Republican candidate for governor, said yesterday that he had agreed to a three-way debate with Mr.
Cuomo and B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Fusion candidate.
Mr.
Cuomo promptly declined to attend the Sunday afternoon debate on WNBC-TV, citing his longstanding insistence that he would attend debates only if all six gubernatorial candidates were invited.
Mr.
Golisano said he would attend if invited.

One Killer Job Not Enough? Add a 2d, With Sweat
WHERE were you when the sun came up this morning?
Warm and cozy under the covers, happily oblivious to the bright orange streak rising on the eastern horizon?
To Nina L. Kurtz, such laziness is unthinkable.
Before dawn she was already at the New York Sports Club in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn, standing before a group of men and women who were huffing, puffing and sweating up a storm, eager to bend and jump and kick at her every command.


Out of State, Giuliani Shows Party Loyalty
A week after his dramatic stretch across party lines to support Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani bolstered his Republican credentials today by campaigning for the party's candidates in predominantly Italian neighborhoods of Boston and Rhode Island.
But everywhere he went, it was his endorsement of Mr.
Cuomo that lingered on people's minds.
At Joe Tecce's Ristorante in Boston, a longtime political haunt, the elderly Joe Tecce himself watched Mr.
Giuliani enter to stump for Ralph C. Martin 2d, the Suffolk County District Attorney.
"Best job you ever did to endorse Cuomo," said Mr.
Tecce, who went on to mangle the Mayor's name as Giuliano, as he predicted he would be New York's governor some day.

New Look at Jail Unit Housing Sex Offenders
A state legislative task force took an unusual tour here today, going behind the razor wire fences and thick concrete walls to view some of the most despised men in New Jersey's penal system, inmates being treated for sexual aberrations that they have not been able to control and that many will never be able to change.
They are the violent rapists and child molesters with compulsive disorders who are often driven to commit more crimes once in the outside world unless their behavior can be modified before their prison time runs out.

RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS  Agassi Passes Test  Andre Agassi, who recalled his last appearance at the Paris Open as a "very painful" experience, made a successful return yesterday with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 victory over Jason Stoltenberg.
Faring far worse than the United States Open champion were No. 3-seeded Michael Stich and No. 5 Stefan Edberg, both second-round losers in the $2.25 million tournament.
Lionel Roux, a wild-card entry from France, upset Stich, 6-3, 6-4, and Petr Korda of the Czech Republic surprised Edberg, rallying for a 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 victory.
Agassi's only other appearance at the Paris Open was in 1992 when he lost to Brad Gilbert, now his coach. (AP)


Erstwhile Sitting Duck Nowadays Sitting Pretty
According to the anti-Washington gospel of the 1994 elections, Senator Conrad Burns ought to be a sitting duck.
Among the Republican incumbents, his seat once looked most vulnerable to a Democratic gain that could balance a loss somewhere else.
But so far, his hard work and rich campaign treasury seem to be carrying Mr.
Burns despite weaknesses that might cripple another candidate.

This is how Willie Mtolo's life has changed since he won the 1992 New York City Marathon: He was voted South Africa's sportsman of the year.
Six months ago, he was one of two athletes invited to the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela.
On Sunday, he will run New York again for victory, but at home he runs often for peace and unity.
He organizes charity runs for peace in the townships where blacks were restricted under the racial policies of apartheid, running with a white flag, encouraging whites to enter black neighborhoods, urging people to come together now that law no longer keeps them apart.


Up-and-Down Night Opens Fall Auctions
Neither low estimates nor heavy pre-sale marketing swayed the international group of buyers who packed Sotheby's salesroom in Manhattan last night.
Buyers did their homework before the contemporary-art auction, the first in a two-week round of important fall sales.
When price and quality found common ground, artworks sold, often with competitive bidding.
But when either of those ingredients was missing, the room went dead.
Of the 71 works up for sale, 43 found buyers.
The sale totaled $12.1 million, less than the low estimate of $14 million to $19 million.


Settlement Reached in Schools' Asbestos Case
Nearly all remaining litigation between school districts and building materials manufacturers over damage to school property from asbestos can be concluded if a Federal court in Philadelphia approves a $200 million settlement announced yesterday.
The agreement between lawyers representing thousands of school districts in the class action and the manufacturers, including the United States Gypsum Company, W. R. Grace &amp; Company and several smaller defendants, would leave just three defendants from more than 50 companies sued when the legal battle began in the early 1980's: Pfizer Inc., the United States Mineral Products Company and the Asbestos Products Manufacturing Corporation.

Yanks Sign Bankhead to One-Year Pact
As the most active major league team during a dormant period, the Yankees yesterday signed the right-handed reliever SCOTT BANKHEAD to a one-year $500,000 contract that includes incentives that could double his salary.
Although there have been no games played since Aug. 11, the Yankees have methodically molded their roster since Sept. 22 by signing PAUL O'NEILL and Bankhead and exercising contract options on MIKE STANLEY, STEVE HOWE and KEVIN ELSTER.


Offer Is Made To Buy Mickelberry
Mickelberry Communications Inc., which owns three agencies including Partners &amp; Shevack in New York, said yesterday that James C. Marlas, its chairman, president and chief executive, had proposed to acquire, through a merger transaction, all the shares of its common stock that he does not already own for $3.25 a share.
Based on the number of shares outstanding, the deal would be worth about $9.94 million.


Merck and Swedish Concern Join
Astra A.B. of Sweden paid $820 million to Merck &amp; Company yesterday for a half-interest in a joint venture that will build on the explosive sales growth of Prilosec, the Swedish company's anti-ulcer drug.
The venture, called Astra Merck Inc., will sell Prilosec and other Astra products in the United States.
Astra Merck, based in Wayne, Pa., already has 500 salespeople marketing Astra products.
Analysts said the new company would have 1995 sales of $1.5 billion, including Prilosec and two Astra cardiovascular drugs, Plendil and Tonocard.

Why is your pay so high, an elderly investor angrily asked Leonard G. Levine recently, when your real estate trust's misfortunes have cost so many people their life savings?
Mr.

Mr.
Levine added that his team at the Banyan Management Corporation was merely trying to salvage the investment.


Yankees Asking Fans To Pay Now, Pray Later
Successfully marketing a major league baseball team whose coming season is in limbo because of a strike is a difficult and delicate chore.

The Yankees are attempting to accomplish this, though, by acting as if 1995 is just another season instead of one cloaked in uncertainty because of labor problems.

Excerpts From Candidates' Speeches in the Gingrich-Jones Race in Georgia
Following are excerpts from speeches by Representative Newt Gingrich, the House minority leader, who is seeking re-election in Georgia, and his Democratic challenger, Ben Jones, a former Representative.
They provide examples of the messages each candidate is delivering in his standard campaign speech.
Mr.
Gingrich spoke on Oct. 24 to a Kiwanis Club in Duluth, Ga., and Mr.
Jones spoke on Oct. 25 at Kennesaw State College in Cobb County, Ga.
The speeches were recorded for C-Span and transcribed by The New York Times.
NEWT GINGRICH
Now, let me be quite direct about this.
We have, I think, a crisis of the system at two levels.
One level is that we can't afford the current structure of Government unless we were to massively raise taxes and crush the private sector.
The other problem you have is the current structure of Government doesn't work.
So, you are paying too much for a system that's destructive.
The problem in Washington -- and those of you who might have seen Tim Russert go at me on "Meet the Press" will appreciate where we're at -- the problem in Washington is that they start with an assumption: this Government can't be changed.
Therefore, how do we get more out of the American people?
And they either get more out of the American people by not sending them back their own money -- cutting entitlements, cutting Social Security -- or we get more out of them by raising taxes.

Heart Ills and High Cholesterol May Not Be Linked in Old Age
CHOLESTEROL levels, which so accurately predict risk of heart disease in middle-aged people, appear to have no such predictive value in the elderly, a new study has found.
The study, by investigators at Yale University, included 997 men and women 70 years old or older who were followed from 1988 until the end of 1992.
It is one of the very few studies of cholesterol to focus on people over 65, and in fact the average age of the study participants was 79.
The researchers report that although a third of the women and a sixth of the men had high cholesterol levels, these people did not have any more heart attacks during the study period than those whose cholesterol levels were normal or even low, nor were they more likely to die from heart disease or from any cause.


Indian Police Free 3 Britons Held Hostage
Indian police officers freed three British tourists today when they stormed the hideout of Kashmiri militants in a remote village in northern India.
An American was freed in a separate police raid on Monday.
The four tourists, held for two weeks, suffered no injuries in the police raids, but two policemen and a militant were killed in the pre-dawn shootout that freed the Britons.
The three Britons and Bela Joseph Nuss, the 43-year-old American freed in the earlier raid, had been threatened with beheading by the militants if the Indian Government refused the kidnappers' demands for the release of 10 Kashmiri militants held in Indian jails.

It is also easier to remove the fat from a product that contains a lot of fruit than from, say, a shortbread cookie that relies in great part on fat for its flavor.

G.M. Asks U.S. to Drop Hearing on Truck Safety
In an unusual move, the General Motors Corporation has asked the Department of Transportation to call off a scheduled public hearing over the safety of millions of older pickup trucks made by G.M. and seek an immediate recall, a move that will cause a court confrontation.
The move is apparently an effort by General Motors, the nation's largest auto maker, to avoid more bad publicity about the trucks, which the department recently ruled were defective and fire prone, as well as to force the Government's recall effort into court, where some lawyers and consumer advocates believe the company may well prevail.

Cheap and Chic in Los Angeles
RIOTS, fires, earthquakes, recession.
This city has been pretty badly battered in the last couple of years.
Faced with the end of the halcyon 1980's, local restaurateurs went around moaning, lamenting the big-money days and wondering if the good times would ever come back.
But as catastrophe followed catastrophe something remarkable happened here: The most successful restaurateurs stopped looking backward and started facing reality.
If people were reluctant to spend money, they would simply charge less.
And do it with style.
This change of attitude has created a virtual restaurant revolution.
Many of the old favorites march on, but some have closed to be replaced by new and less expensive places.


AT THE GUGGENHEIM WITH: Doris Lessing; A Portrait Unwinds, As in Life
AS Doris Lessing strolls through the Guggenheim, she is drawn not so much to the modern Italian art, gadgets, furniture and fashions on exhibit as to the sleek railing that coils around the museum, the angles pointed just off the spiral's breaks.
She studies the circles and semicircles of the floor tiles.
"Everything's a little off center, so you feel sick," she says.
"There's something vertiginous about it."
With her own years winding down, Mrs.
Lessing has turned to perhaps the most dizzying perspective of all, the look back over the people, places, loves and sorrows that make up a life.
Her book, "Under My Skin: Volume 1 of My Autobiography, to 1949" (HarperCollins, $25), has just been released to coincide with her 75th birthday.
It takes her from a childhood in Persia and a hardscrabble farm in southern Rhodesia, through her romance with the Communist Party in the 1940's, three children and two failed marriages.
It ends with her arriving in London at age 30, carrying the son from her last marriage and her first book, "The Grass Is Singing," along with the expectation that real life would finally begin.


The Pop Life
Snoop Doggy Dogg
Snoop Doggy Dogg, the platinum-selling gangster rapper and defendant in a murder case, can now add film industry pariah to his list of accomplishments.
His record label, Death Row/Interscope, has been having a hard time finding a theater that will allow it to lease a screen for a public showing of "Murder Was the Case," an 18-minute film based on the Snoop Doggy Dogg song of the same name and directed by the music producer and rapper Dr.
Dre.
Snoop Doggy Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, says "Murder Was the Case" is not about the August 1993 shooting death of Philip Waldemariam in Los Angeles, for which he, McKinley Lee and Sean Smith are to be tried on Jan. 13.
Though the soundtrack for the short film went to No. 1 on the pop charts last week -- once again proving rap's appeal to audiences of all races and classes -- theater owners are worried about a repeat of the violence in some movie houses when "Boyz N the Hood" and "New Jack City" had their premieres, said an executive who is helping to distribute "Murder Was the Case" for Death Row/Interscope.

Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney's office, said the man, Daniel L. Price, 34, shattered the doors with a baseball bat a day after he had sent a threatening letter to the Palestinian scholar Edward Said, a professor at Columbia.

The Central Intelligence Agency's nine-year hunt for Aldrich H. Ames, the convicted spy for Moscow, was led astray by the false scents of Soviet deception as well as the C.I.A.'s own ineptitude, a Senate committee said today.
In a damning 116-page report, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence offered a wealth of new details on the most devastating case of treachery in the intelligence agency's history.
It described a series of wrong turns, blind alleys and dead ends the investigation followed from 1985, when Mr.
Ames first sold secrets to the Soviet Union, until this February, when the C.I.A. career officer was arrested.

But this year, for the first time, most students who live on the College Avenue and Douglass campuses will be able to vote there.
Students at the third Rutgers campus here, Cook College, will have to continue to make their way to off-campus polling places.

Each potential bidder had to disclose its intentions by last Friday, though the details were not known until today.

Armand D'Amato, a Long Island lawyer, admittedly persuaded the Senator's office to send letters lobbying the Navy on behalf of a military contractor and D'Amato client, the Unisys Corporation.
Mailed out over the Senator's signature, the letters were actually written by Unisys employees.

Though the sparring began with the personal attacks that characterized the last weeks of the campaign, both candidates also offered contrasting approaches to issues like crime and education.
Mr.
Bush said he stood for "powerful" ideas, like making prisoners serve a minimum of 85 percent of their sentences and limiting the appeals that death row inmates can make.

Shostakovich's 15 String Quartets Form a Thread
Perhaps it is only natural that classical music listeners regard certain works by certain composers through a bifocal lens, taking account of both the near and distant perspective.
Completists at heart, we apprehend individual pieces as interconnected parts of a larger whole.
But inherently suspicious of the mysticism that sustains such a view, we earnestly hold onto a real-world perspective: that the works are also snapshots of distinct emotional states.
Naturally, certain conditions are required before this split focus takes effect.
The composer must be heroic in the best Romantic sense, a warrior who battles inhuman powers and whose spirit survives blows that would crush lesser mortals.
And however else they might be interpreted, the works must seem to chronicle this lifelong war.
They must also make a reasonably concise set: Beethoven's nine symphonies work this way; Haydn's 104 (or so) do not.

Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who entered national politics to unseat President George Bush two years ago, jumped into the Texas gubernatorial campaign today to endorse Gov.

Calling her "smart, tough and principled," Mr.

For Families, Night of Helpless Grief
Halloween was an evening of helpless grief for the families of those killed in the crash of American Eagle Flight 4184, mourning the sudden loss of loved ones while neighborhood children rang the doorbell over and over, cheerfully demanding trick-or-treats.
News of the crash came differently to each family, and for each it was a different kind of nightmare.
Many family members interviewed yesterday seemed dazed by the crash and the sudden onslaught of relatives, friends, media calls and television crews gathered both inside and outside their homes.
Several had chosen friends or relatives to handle all calls so that they could have a modicum of peace in which to come to terms with the loss.

The Flavors of Earlier Eras
MANY of this fall's best new cookbooks seek to recapture earlier eras.
To reinforce the memories, some have grainy black and white photos that look as if they were peeled from family albums.
BITTER ALMONDS -- RECOLLECTIONS AND RECIPES FROM A SICILIAN GIRLHOOD by Maria Grammatico and Mary Taylor Simeti (Morrow, $20) is the poignant story of a Sicilian woman.
As a child just after World War II, she was sent by her impoverished, widowed mother to live in San Carlo, a convent in the hill town of Erice, known for its confections.
Maria Grammatico's tale, captured in a lively conversational tone by Mary Taylor Simeti, is astonishing for its account of an often joyless, rigid existence -- of peeling almonds and beating sugar mixtures for six hours at a time, of awakening before dawn to prime the ovens and of eating gruel that Oliver Twist might have refused.
But the experience led Mrs.
Grammatico to open a pastry shop in Erice, where many of the historic almond and marzipan recipes of the region are still made.
The book includes 100 recipes.

The Syracuse option offense comes into Saturday's game at the Carrier Dome against Miami with a 32.7-point scoring average, 15th best among Division I-A teams.

Court Rules That Conspiring About Drugs Can Be Crime
Issuing its first opinion of the term, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that conspiring to commit a narcotics crime can be a violation of Federal law even if the conspiracy is never carried out.
The decision, in an opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, was not surprising since it reversed the one Federal appeals court that had differed on the issue from the 11 other Federal appellate circuits.

Defense Blames Mental Trauma For a Shooting
The Lebanese immigrant charged with killing one Hasidic student and wounding three others in a shooting attack on the Brooklyn Bridge suffered from a post-traumatic shock shared by many Arab victims of Mideast warfare and was thus not mentally responsible, his lawyer contended yesterday at the opening of his murder trial.
"He had no more control than a fire knows why it's burning," Eric M. Sears, the lawyer for the defendant, Rashid Baz, said in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
"Eighteen years in Beirut left scars on his personality."

Race for Governor: Cuomo Labels Pataki as Radical
CANDIDATE Mario M. Cuomo (paid for by the New York State Democratic Committee) PRODUCER Axelrod &amp; Associates, Chicago and Washington ON THE SCREEN Black-and-white scenes of State Senator George E. Pataki, Pat Robertson and a newspaper headline reading "George is 100 percent 'right' according to Pat Robertson," then of assault weapons laid out together, as white letters on black background come zooming into view to highlight parts of script over ominous music.
SCRIPT Announcer: "The more you learn about George Pataki's friends, the more you wonder. As a State Senator, Pataki won the top rating from Pat Robertson's radical coalition, which preaches a ban on abortion and wants creationism taught in our schools. And now, the National Rifle Association's endorsed Pataki, who's opposed tougher gun laws, like the ban on assault weapons. The N.R.A., Pat Robertson and the radical right. If George Pataki's their man, can he really be ours?" ACCURACY In 1993, Mr.
Pataki did receive a 100 percent rating from the Christian Coalition, based on four votes: Medicaid funding for abortions, a bill that finances the Medicaid program through aid to local governments, the section of the budget that provided for postponing scheduled tax cuts and a bill on child pornography.
This year, his rating was 83 percent.
Mr.
Pataki supports abortion rights, though he has voted consistently for restrictions.
He says he supports a ban on assault weapons, but in April he voted against an amendment to a gun-licensing bill that included sharp restrictions on a number of assault weapons.
At first, he denied the vote, then said it was procedural and now says it was a partisan vote with the Republican majority on a measure that did not go far enough.
SCORECARD This is one of the harshest ads of the race, produced and paid for by the State Democratic Committee in part because the Governor's media adviser, David Garth, has opposed making such attacks.
But for weeks now, Mr.
Cuomo has sought to define Mr.
Pataki as out of step with a state that retains a strong plurality of Democratic voters likely to reject a strongly conservative candidate, and polls suggest the Governor's attacks have been working.
The risk is that the imputed link between Mr.
Pataki and the Christian right is tenuous, and voters may be put off by the tough tone.

Wisdom at West Point
Two days before West Point's Oct. 22 football game with The Citadel, 600 West Point cadets rallied for a so-called "spirit run" past a line of Army team members.
Cheers were shouted, backs were slapped -- and the breasts of 18 of the 51 female cadets were groped.
Another Tailhook?
No, partly because the run involved a cordon of excited college students, not a gantlet of drunken adult louts, and mostly because West Point was very quick (within 24 hours of the "run") to investigate the incident and contemplate appropriate measures.
That is a lot more than the Navy has ever been able to boast about its response to Tailhook '91.

Personal Health; Sorrow's web: Depressed mother and difficult child.
THE 10-month-old boy was brought to Dr.
Morris Green because his mother thought he might be retarded.
He made very few baby noises and seemed apathetic and unresponsive.
But even before examining the baby, the pediatrician noticed something unusual about his mother.
"She looked very sad, sighed occasionally, did not interact playfully with her son and kept her gaze downward," Dr.
Green recalled in an article in Contemporary Pediatrics.
The baby, too, was very sober and ignored the doctor's friendly smile.
When the infant was offered a colorful cube, rather than grasping it as a child that age normally would, he touched it gingerly, as if it were very hot.


Maurice B. Stein, 58, Who Ran Camp Echo Lake for 30 Years
Maurice B. Stein, owner of a well-known summer camp in upstate New York, died on Monday in the crash of an American Eagle commuter plane near Roselawn, Ind.
He was 58.
For 30 years, Mr.
Stein and his wife, the former Amy Medine, operated Camp Echo Lake, five miles northwest of Lake George in Warrensburg, N.Y.
At his death, Mr.
Stein, known as Morry, was en route to his home in Hartsdale, N.Y., after working on a fund-raising program for underprivileged children at the headquarters of the American Camping Association in Martinsville, Ind., his son Tony said.
Mr.
Stein, a stalwart of the camping industry, was a former president of the American Camping Association and its New York section as well as a former president of the New York State Camp Directors Association.
He was 28 years old when he bought Camp Echo Lake from his wife's parents, who founded it in 1946.
Under Maurice and Amy Stein, the camp expanded to 150 acres and its enrollment grew from 80 campers to about 450, boys and girls ages 8 to 17.
Mr.
Stein also founded the Echo Lake Idea, a scholarship program that for 25 years has been bringing 40 or 50 underprivileged city children from around the state to the camp for a fully paid week's vacation at the end of August.
Mr.
Stein, a native of Bloomsburg, Pa., was a 1958 graduate of Brandeis University.
He received an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1960 and worked for several years in business before buying Camp Echo Lake in 1964.
In addition to his wife and son Tony, who lives in Manhattan, Mr.
Stein is survived by his sons George, of Manhattan, and Eric, of Hartsdale.

Race for Governor: Pataki Says Cuomo Is Buying Election
CANDIDATE: George E. Pataki PRODUCER: Russo, Marsh &amp; Associates, Sacramento, Calif., and Alexandria, Va.
VISUAL: Photographs of Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Shoreham nuclear plant, plus newspaper headlines and highlights of the script over ominous music.
Ends with photograph of Mr.
Cuomo scratching his head.
Politicians of many stripes and the financial markets greeted the idea skeptically.
Mr.
Cuomo contends a takeover would lead to lower electric rates, by eliminating shareholder dividends and Federal taxes the utility now pays.
Mayor Giuliani's proposed budget modification, announced a day after his endorsement of the Governor, does depend on $150 million in new aid from Albany, although he and Mr.
Cuomo insist they never discussed any deal, and no governor can deliver much in the way of state aid without the cooperation of the Legislature.
Mr.
Cuomo has proposed no tax increases.
SCORECARD: Mr.
Pataki is vulnerable to the charge -- by Mr.
Giuliani and other local officials -- that his proposed state income tax cuts would force higher local taxes.
This ad tries to turn that attack around, arguing that Mr.
Cuomo is the taxer who is pitting different parts of the state against each other.
In making that claim, of course, Mr.
Pataki seeks to divide the state further, and energize his base in the upstate areas that have provided a growing share of the electorate.
The ad's anti-tax message could hit home, as does its suggestion that the Lilco plan is an election-year gambit.
But its conspiracy theory may strike voters as hard to believe, and it does nothing to sketch in Mr.
Pataki's own personality or ideas.

Music Notes
Schumann's 2d of 4
The manuscript of Robert Schumann's Second Symphony, which has been in a private collection and unavailable to scholars since 1950, is to be auctioned at Sotheby's in London on Dec. 1.
The auction house expects it to sell for about $1.42 million, roughly the price the manuscript of Schumann's Piano Concerto brought in November 1989.
The record price for the sale of classical music manuscripts was set in 1987, when nine Mozart symphonies sold for $4.5 million.
The manuscript will be on display at Sotheby's in New York City from Tuesday to Friday next week.
If the score is acquired by a library and comes under scholarly scrutiny, it could yield at least subtle changes in the way the music is performed, since it includes alterations and corrections Schumann made as late as 1853.
Modern editions of the work are based mainly on the version that was published in 1847.

Four Unheard Witnesses In Thomas-Hill Inquiry
Tonight "Turning Point" uses the appearance of yet another book on the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill affair as an opportunity for a reprise of the juicier parts of the 1991 confirmation hearings.
The news picked up from "Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas" by Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson (Houghton Mifflin) is that four women who were prepared to give testimony about Judge Thomas's courtship style and reading habits were not heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The authors will be on "Good Morning America" tomorrow.
On tonight's program, "Anita Hill vs. Clarence Thomas: The Untold Story" -- a title that echoes "The Real Anita Hill: The Untold Story" (Free Press), last year's best-selling Hill-basher -- Michel McQueen, the evening's reporter, talks to the women in question.


Holy Bull To Bask In Florida Sunshine
This was moving day at Keeneland Race Course in nearby Lexington, and they were moving a giant from Stall 17, Barn 26: The great gray superstar Holy Bull, marching to his own drum beat and ignoring the hurly-burly of the Breeders' Cup here just 70 miles up the interstate, headed for a winter in Florida.
"You've got to draw the line somewhere," said Jimmy Croll, his owner and trainer, "and I drew it."

Jane Hayward, a curator of medieval art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an authority on stained glass, died on Sunday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx.
She was 76 and lived in Riverdale.
The cause was cancer, said William D. Wixom, chairman of the museum's department of medieval art.


WARY OF EXPENSE, ARABS BLOCK PLAN FOR MIDEAST BANK
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries refused today to support a Clinton Administration proposal for a multibillion-dollar development bank for the Middle East, saying that their own economic problems make it difficult for them to put up the necessary money.
In a rebuff to the United States, the Arab countries said at an economic conference that while they support peace with Israel, they should not be expected to provide the financing for the bank because of their problems with mounting debts and low oil prices.

Fears of inflation and robust economic growth were rekindled in financial markets yesterday by two fresh economic reports, which sent stock and bond prices sharply lower.
Analysts said the new economic data increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would move soon to raise short-term interest rates -- perhaps as early as Friday -- and could move them higher than previously expected over the next six months.

Southerners Facing the New Amid Ghosts of the Old
IN THE TENNESSEE COUNTRY
By Peter Taylor
226 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $21.
"I don't want to live," cries a young girl in Peter Taylor's melancholy new novel, and you shrug benignly: who between the ages of 12 and 20 hasn't felt that way?
But when she adds, "I don't want to grow old in this life," that is something else again.
It is not the stuff of youthful melodrama; it is the stuff of workaday despair: the pileup of losses and adjustments, the longing that nobody's interested in, the knowledge that at points in your life you were allowed to choose, and you chose wrongly.

Continuing a time-honored political tradition, hundreds of lawyers, architects, engineers and construction companies with state contracts are making contributions to one or the other of the candidates for governor in New York -- or, for that matter, to both.

New Baseball League Offers Profit Sharing for Cities and Players
Offering partnerships in the form of an innovative profit-sharing and equity plan for cities and players alike, its founders launched the United Baseball League yesterday, intent on succeeding where virtually every other new rival sports league has failed.
"We think we're going to succeed because of a confluence of factors," Bob Mrazek, a former five-time Congressman from Long Island, said yesterday.
He cited "cities that yearn to have major league caliber baseball, investors who want to participate in a new structure and design for owning a team and enough major league players who are going to choose to play in an entrepreneurial and nonconfrontational atmosphere in this new league."


Playwright's Tough Subject Draws Funny Offers
In "The Waiting Room," three women from different centuries are waiting to see the doctor: an 18th-century Chinese wife whose feet have been bound and deformed, a Victorian lady who has been too tightly corseted emotionally as well as physically and a contemporary American woman whose breast implants have led to cancer.
Each has been abused in the name of beauty, or at least beauty as fantasized by a male-dominated society.
Lisa Loomer's new play deals with everything from medical malpractice to misogyny, while crosscutting through time and space.
Wendy Wasserstein, who saw the play in its workshop last year at the Williamstown Theater Festival, described it as "dark but colorful." "It's not a polite humor and it has a political force," she said.
"It's a play with an issue but it does not deal with it as an issue play."


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; An offbeat corporate campaign is the latest homage to Hollywood.
A COMPANY known, if at all, for prosaic products from coal to cookware is seeking to enliven its dowdy image with a sprinkling of Hollywood stardust.
Hanson Industries, the United States unit of the British conglomerate Hanson P.L.C., is running an unusual campaign to encourage institutional and individual investors to buy Hanson's American depository receipts, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
Rather than following the corporate advertising template of hyperbolically promoting its stock performance, or offering soft-focus paeans to its employees, Hanson is parodying well-known films to purvey information.


Another Defection for Cuban Boxing Team
A member of the Cuban national boxing team took advantage of a one-night stopover in Miami to defect Monday with the help of a former teammate who defected last year.

On the Trail
Developments yesterday in campaigns across the country.
VIRGINIA -- A computer check of state and Federal election commission reports by the Rainbow Coalition has found that more than 40 contributors to previous political campaigns of David Duke in Louisiana have donated a combined $38,000 -- more than twice what they gave Mr.
Duke -- to Oliver L. North, the Republican trying to unseat Senator Charles S. Robb, a Democrat.
A North campaign spokesman, Mark Merritt, said the money from Duke supporters was unsolicited and came as something of a surprise.
The Rev.
Jesse Jackson, president of the Rainbow Coalition, said the crossover suggested "an ideological kinship" between Mr.
Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, and Mr.
North.
Mr.
North called Mr.
Jackson's assertion "fear mongering."
MARYLAND -- Eighty-two percent of black voters in Maryland back the Democratic candidate for governor, Parris Glendening, preferring him 9 to 1 over his Republican opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, The Washington Post reported.
The newspaper said only 9 percent of black voters polled in a random telephone survey of 808 registered voters Oct. 8-11 backed Ms.
Sauerbrey, whom white voters supported 46 percent to 44 percent for Mr.
Glendening.
Mr.
Glendening courted black leaders, winning the early endorsement of Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore by promising expanded state aid and a renewed effort to stimulate economic development in the city.
Blacks make up one quarter of Maryland's population.

As Haiti prepared today to commemorate its first All Souls' Day under democratic rule in more than a generation, relatives were able to mourn openly for the first time the thousands of victims of political repression.
Standing before the Universal Tomb, the mausoleum at the municipal cemetery that honors those dead who have no tomb of their own, they talked quietly to the spirits of the deceased, banging their hands on each of the four walls of the memorial as they spoke.


North Turned Blind Eye to Drug Dealers
To the Editor:
Methinks Elliott Abrams, former Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, doth protest too much when he says it is "false" and "outrageous" to suggest that Oliver L. North, the Republican Senate candidate from Virginia, countenanced the presence of drug traffickers in the United States-supported contra war campaign against the Nicaraguan Government ("2 Reagan Officials Dispute Drug Claims Against North," news article, Oct. 25).


Cut-and-Spend Democrat Lags in Connecticut
William E. Curry Jr., the State Comptroller who is running for governor of Connecticut as a "New Democrat," is the only one among the four candidates talking about creating ambitious new programs.
"This is not about changing governors, but about changing government," he often says.
That message, however, has not been an easy sell for Mr.
Curry, who has never risen above 28 percent in the polls in a state where 38 percent of registered voters are Democrats.

The furlough took effect on Monday, and although officials of the group said they hoped it would last no more than a week or two, it showed the depth of the financial crisis gripping the organization after accusations of financial abuses by some of its leaders.

The Dow Brands unit of the Dow Chemical Company, which markets products like Ziploc bags and Fantastik cleaner, has named Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis and the Ryan Partnership in Westport, Conn., to handle its consolidated North American integrated marketing account, advertising executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity said yesterday.
The account, with billings estimated at $100 million, was previously divided among 10 agencies including Campbell Mithun, which has handled brands like Ziploc and Saran Wrap.
The executives confirmed a report of the assignment in the Daily Fax edition of Advertising Age.
Ann Roehl, a spokeswoman for Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, declined to comment yesterday.

Perot to Help Golisano's Bid For Governor

But this was actually the moment Mr.
Golisano had awaited for more than a month.
In a surprise move, the Texan agreed to appear with Mr.
Golisano on Saturday, at a joint news conference in Manhattan and at a rally later in the day in Rochester.

"This year against Wagner, we threw it 38 times. In all of our games, the passing numbers have dropped off from last year, and there's a major reason for that."

U.S. Spree Bolsters The Dollar
The Clinton Administration went on a billion-dollar global buying spree today to prop up the value of the dollar.
It succeeded, at least for now, in reviving the currency after it had fallen to a new post-World War II low against the Japanese yen.
But other nations did not appear to join in the effort, and there were signs late in the day that the markets were questioning a declaration by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen that the "movements in the dollar are inconsistent" with the strength of the American economy.

2 Escape Bus Heading to Juvenile Detention Center in Bronx
One was 13 years old when he was arrested on charges of fatally shooting a man in Brooklyn last April.
The other, who is 16, has been convicted of arson for throwing a firebomb in an apartment building in upper Manhattan.
Both escaped on Tuesday night from a bus transporting them from court to the Spofford Juvenile Detention Center in the South Bronx.
One turned himself in last night, but the hunt for the other continued.


An Appeals Court With Blinders
The University of Maryland was segregated until 1954, and in a recent court case, officials of the university said they felt obligated to live down its discriminatory past.
In a Federal court in Baltimore, the officials described a modest program for attracting black students who are put off by the school's lingering reputation among minorities.
It sets aside 1 percent of its financial aid budget for high-achieving minority members and lets students of all races compete for the rest.
Both the candor of Maryland's administrators and their dedication to remedying past discrimination are laudable.
The district judge found the plan sensible and effective.
But three judges of the U.S.
Court of Appeals in Richmond have reversed that judgment and, with a blindness that is maddening, held the program unconstitutional.

Three days before the 25th New York City Marathon, the marathon's perennial heated weather debate seems to be tilting away from the Allan Steinfeld sunny-spectator-skies model and toward the colder-the-better runners' position staked out by the marathon's founder, Fred Lebow.
Lebow, who died on Oct. 9, once described the marathon ideal as "a temperature between 40 and 45 degrees and raining." Steinfeld, Lebow's successor as marathon director, prefers balmy weather that will lure huge crowds.
"The runners," he noted, "will be there no matter what."

RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS  Woodforde Upsets Courier  Jim Courier's slump showed no sign of ending when he lost by 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 to Mark Woodforde yesterday in the second round of the $2.25 million Paris Open.
Courier, once the world's No. 1 player but now ranked 14th and seeded 13th in Paris, will finish the year outside the top 10 for the first time since 1990.
He has not won a tournament since August 1993, and this was the second consecutive year in which Courier lost his opening match at the Paris Open.
Pete Sampras and Boris Becker both survived first-set scares by Dutch opponents.
Sampras, the top-seeded player, downed Jacco Eltingh, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4.
Becker, fresh from a tournament victory in Sweden, eliminated Paul Haarhuis, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. (AP) YACHT RACING  One Australia Wins  The new 75-foot yacht One Australia won the third race yesterday of the International America's Cup Class World Championship, but not without a battle to the finish with the all-women's team, America .
The women's team led at the start of the 18.5-mile race off San Diego.
The boat, skippered by J. J. Isler at the start, and later by Leslie Egnot, led six other cup yachts.
But at the fourth mark in the six-stage race, John Bertrand, skipper of One Australia, passed America .
A 17-knot wind, far brisker than the 5-6 knots that prevailed at the first two races of the championship, made the fight for first place all the more dramatic.
One Australia crossed the start line prematurely, and had to re-round.
In the meantime, America  was off to a clean start, well ahead of One Australia on the right side of the course.
After finally passing America , Bertrand found himself in a tough tactical battle, having to jibe back and forth to hold his slim lead in the fifth leg.
At the finish, One Australia was 32 seconds ahead of America  .

Conseco Scales Back $3.25 Billion Bid for Kemper
Conseco, the insurance company that outbid General Electric for the right to buy the Kemper Corporation in June, scaled back its $3.25 billion offer yesterday and asked Kemper to accept $2.96 billion -- about the same as the G.E. offer.
Under the new proposal, Conseco would offer for each share of Kemper a $60 package of $56 cash and slightly more than one-tenth of a share of Conseco stock worth $4.
Last summer, Conseco offered a $67 package consisting of $56 cash and $11 of Conseco stock.
Conseco would issue 4.3 million shares of its stock under the new proposal, less than half the 9.5 million of the old proposal.

Homes also require less glamorous things like insurance, lawn mowers and vacuum cleaners.

Developments yesterday in campaigns across the country.
CALIFORNIA: Spending records continue to fall.
New figures released by the Federal Election Commission show that the Republican challenger, Michael W. Huffington, has raised $27.3 million, almost all from his own fortune, while his Democratic opponent, Senator Dianne Feinstein, has raised $11 million. (The previous record was $26.5 million spent in the 1984 North Carolina Senate contest.) They have spent virtually all that amount.
An analysis by The Los Angeles Times showed that Mr.
Huffington had put almost $20 million into television advertising, out-spending Ms.
Feinstein on such commercials almost 3 to 1.


Charles Busch Takes On a Trouser Role
Christopher, the hero of the utterly winning new comedy "You Should Be So Lucky" at the Primary Stages, is a lonely Greenwich Village electrolysist full of sighing references to diva films like "Laura" and "I Want to Live." But when he first appears, the cinematic quotation that springs to mind is from a very different sort of movie, "King's Row," in which an actor named Ronald Reagan said: "Where's the rest of me?"
That's because Christopher is portrayed by the play's author, Charles Busch, a fabled drag performer who has hitherto seldom set foot on a New York stage without a glitzy dress and heels high enough to induce vertigo.


Dicterow Cancellation
The violinist Glenn Dicterow has canceled his four appearances as soloist with the New York Philharmonic this week and next because of illness.
He was to have played Chausson's "Poeme" and Ravel's "Tzigane," under the direction of Charles Dutoit.
The two pieces have been dropped from the program; instead, the orchestra will play Rachmaninoff's "Isle of the Dead" in addition to Prokofiev's "Love for Three Oranges" Suite and Respighi's "Fountains of Rome" and "Pines of Rome." The concerts are tonight, tomorrow and Saturday at 8 P.M. and Tuesday at 7:30 P.M.

Teen-Ager in Kidnapping Case Tells Court He Ran Away
A Jewish teen-ager who prosecutors say was kidnapped by an ultra-Orthodox rabbi and his wife testified yesterday that he had not been abducted but voluntarily ran away from an "unnormal" home in which his mother regularly beat him.
But in vigorous cross-examination, a prosecutor sought to depict the youth, 15-year-old Shai Fhima Reuven, as someone who was lying to protect the defendants -- Rabbi Shlomo Helbrans and his wife, Malka -- as well as others said to have conspired in Shai's two-year disappearance, which ended last February.

Justices Appear to Favor Employees on a Job-Discrimination Issue
In an unusually lopsided Supreme Court argument today, the Justices signaled their strong disapproval of permitting employers to escape liability for discrimination by coming up with belated evidence that a former employee filing a discrimination suit deserved dismissal for other reasons.
Several courts have recently ruled that employers who find such evidence have a complete defense to that employee's complaint of discriminatory treatment under Federal civil rights law.
Evidence in these cases typically includes a previously undiscovered infraction of work rules or an exaggeration on a long-ago employment application that would have justified dismissal had the employer known of it.

A rapid rise in politically inspired violence in Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire and now Tanzania is forcing the United Nations to consider strengthening the role of its international mission in the region, possibly with the introduction of a protection force.
The Security Council will consider the issue this month.
It will also be the focus of a meeting of refugee and aid organizations in Geneva early next week called by Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.


Haytaian, a Trenton Insider, Seeks Senate as an Outsider
For years before Chuck Haytaian began running for the United State Senate, he was running the New Jersey State Assembly with a forcefulness that left little doubt about who was in charge.
In an age in which party politics has in many places been eroded by individual personality and style, Mr.
Haytaian ruled Trenton as a master of the public gesture and the private deal, a leader who punished the wayward and rewarded the loyal in ways that left the authority of the Speaker beyond any question.

A Set Up, Williams Gets Stung By Reality
Venus Williams, the 14-year-old tennis debutante who made a triumphant transition into professionalism with a straight-set victory on Monday, had the welcome mat abruptly yanked from beneath her tonight by Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the world's second-ranked player.
But Williams did not submit to the Spaniard's greater authority without a stirring fight.
Instead, she put on a bravura show in the opening set, and even had the veteran down and dazed in the second before her youthful enthusiasm evaporated into a 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 comeback by Sanchez Vicario.

Turn the word "mom" upside down and what do you have?
No guessing here, it's "wow," and one might well ask, so what?
So, as Dr.

The women in the audience, most of whom admitted to being over 50, loved it.

He died in his sleep, apparently of a heart attack, the Progressive said.


A Man of Movement Right at Home With Music
Lar Lubovitch is a choreographer very much at home in classical music, popular songs and the Minimalist scores that he was one of the first to use for dance in the 1970's.
All three musical genres, with "The Blue Danube" thrown in more as a fillip than filler, were represented Tuesday night at the benefit that opened a two-week season by the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea).

A New Standard For Lead in Faucets
A national plumbing and water supply industry group has published a long-delayed voluntary standard on how much lead should be allowed to leach into drinking water from faucets, ice makers and drinking fountains, giving consumers who are concerned about contamination a way to pick and choose among fixtures.
But health experts say that the standard for the industry's new seal of approval, which will start showing up on packages on store shelves in about a year, is still too lax to insure that the water is potable.


Ireland and Britain Praise Clinton's Ulster Aid
Ireland and Britain today praised the Clinton Administration's decision to increase economic aid to Northern Ireland as a step toward advancing peace there.
The White House announced late Tuesday that the President had decided to raise aid to Northern Ireland to $30 million a year over the next two fiscal years, up from the $20 million a year that was planned.

That afternoon, he took a one-hour flight to Johannesburg, making his connection for a 10-hour flight to Frankfurt.
After sitting around the Frankfurt airport for six hours, Govender boarded an eight-hour flight to Chicago, arriving late Friday afternoon, feeling stiff and exhausted.
Forty hours later, he ran the Chicago Marathon.


Discovery That AIDS Can Be Prevented in Babies Raises Debate on Mandatory Testing
A finding that it is possible to prevent most cases of AIDS in babies has opened a heated debate over mandatory AIDS testing.
The problem is that to prevent AIDS in a child, infected women must take a powerful AIDS drug while they are pregnant.
And that means identifying pregnant women who, often without knowing it, are infected with the AIDS virus.
The finding arose from a Federal study whose results were so stunning that it was halted prematurely and its results were announced in February, to great fanfare.
They are being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, along with two editorials that raise ethical questions about how to put the discovery into practice.


Journal; Justice for None
With today's publication of "Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas," American blood will come to a new boil over the most rending he-said/she-said conflict of our time.
But not necessarily because of this gripping book's revelations about Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas.
The authors, Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson of The Wall Street Journal, do produce named sources who both corroborate Ms.
Hill's testimony and detail other incidents in which a porno-fixated Mr.
Thomas hit on the more vulnerable (which is to say, black) women in his employ.
This is unlikely, however, to shock a country where a majority tell pollsters they already believe that Mr.
Thomas committed perjury.

A Spy Trader Goes on Trial In Germany
A cold war lawyer and spy trader who brokered freedom for 33,755 East German political prisoners in exchange for $2.3 billion paid to the Communists by the West German Government went on trial today on charges of helping the secret police blackmail former clients into leaving houses and property behind.
The lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, 69, who became a millionaire and was a respected confidant of leaders on both sides of the Berlin wall until its collapse five years ago made his services unnecessary, is the most prominent East German private citizen to be charged with knowingly taking part in criminal wrongdoing by the Communist Government.


Bond Prices Follow Dollar In Decline
Prices of Treasury securities slid yesterday, as they have every day this week, following the dollar's plunge to a post-World War II low against the Japanese yen and the Federal Reserve's latest "beige book" report suggesting that inflation could accelerate.
A weakening dollar causes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities to become less attractive to foreign investors, and as a consequence the yield on the long bond was pushed very close to a three-year high.

F.B.I. Rebuff For Witness In Shooting
The garage mechanic who eventually led investigators to the man suspected of shooting at a van full of Hasidim on the Brooklyn Bridge described yesterday how he frantically tried to tell the F.B.I. that the gunman was in his shop -- only to be rebuffed.
Twice he called; first he was told to give his information over the phone, which he refused to do, and when he called again he was told someone would be sent out to talk to him.
Finally, the F.B.I. agreed to send someone to meet him on a street corner, but no agent ever showed up, the mechanic, Amir Abudaif, testified.

Airliner Turned Over Before Crashing
The American Eagle plane that crashed near here on Monday night took an unexplained dip to the right, recovered, dipped again and turned upside down just before it plunged to the ground, killing all 68 people aboard, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said at a briefing tonight.
The cockpit voice recorder and the the flight data recorder from the airplane, which was on its way to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, showed that the wing flaps, which can be used to increase lift, were extended 15 degrees.
It also showed that as the plane began descending from 10,000 feet, probably in response to instructions radioed to the pilots from the ground, it picked up speed.
Then, an alarm sounded, indicating that it was moving too fast to have its flaps extended.


The Birthday Gift That Keeps on Giving


Editors' Note
An article on Oct. 24 about The National Enquirer's coverage of the O. J. Simpson case compared that tabloid's performance with those of several mainstream television stations, newspapers and magazines.
It cited false reports or missteps by some of those organizations.
As one example, the article reported that The New Yorker magazine, in the July 25 issue, speculated that a Los Angeles police detective, Mark Fuhrman, planted a bloody glove at Mr.
Simpson's estate.


U.S. Embargo of Cuba Violates U.N.'s Wishes
To the Editor:
The United States has asserted itself as the key player in the United Nations, utilizing it as a bulwark in creating multinational forces.
The United States has prided itself on the cohesiveness of these coalitions.
I do not want to debate its role in any of these actions; I merely seek to point out the hypocrisy of continuing an embargo against Cuba when the General Assembly last week voted 101 to 2, with 48 abstentions, to condemn the embargo.


Abortion Foe Is Guilty of Murder In Deaths of 2 at a Florida Clinic
A Florida jury took only 20 minutes today to convict Paul J. Hill of two counts of first-degree murder for shooting to death a doctor and an escort outside an abortion clinic last summer.
On Thursday, the jury of six men and six women will consider whether to recommend that Mr.
Hill, a former Presbyterian minister and a militant opponent of abortion, be executed in Florida's electric chair.


Endowment Ends Program Helping Individual Artists
The National Endowment for the Arts, wrestling with nearly $3 million in budget cuts that followed Congressional rebukes over works it backed, has eliminated the system that allowed local nonprofit organizations to earmark $1.3 million in Federal grants for individual artists.
The change, which endowment officials describe as a strictly budgetary response to a shrinking fiscal pie, has raised a furor among nonprofit arts agencies.
They contend the endowment made the cuts in part to avoid the political fallout that has come from helping artists whose work is unconventional and sometimes controversial, and that it disproportionately hurts individual artists rather than institutions.

Review/Fashion; Lauren Takes a Cue From Cool Beauties
RALPH LAUREN is back on home ground.
After forays to Indochina and medieval England in his last two collections, the spring show yesterday was a return to more familiar territory.
Taking inspiration from cool Hollywood beauties like Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn, he showed clothes that were quiet and understated in the softest of colors and the finest of fabrics.
He used opalescent tones of pink and blue for satin and cashmere, chose pastel hues for floral silk chiffons and put white linen collars and cuffs on black dresses and sweaters.


At $3.6 Million, Warhol's 'Marilyn' Is a Star Again
In three and a half minutes, Andy Warhol again catapulted to the top of the art market last night.
At Christie's brilliant auction of contemporary art, Warhol's "Shot Red Marilyn," the famous 1964 silk-screen of Marilyn Monroe with a repaired bullet hole over the left eyebrow, fetched $3.6 million, nicely above Christie's estimate of $2.5 million to $3 million.
The painting, one of the most famous images in contemporary art, was sold to an unidentified telephone bidder.
This was not just any image of the actress, but the one that fetched a Warhol record of $4.01 million at Christie's in New York in 1989, at the height of the market.
The buyer then, Masao Wanibuchi, a Tokyo-based tailor and collector, was the seller last night.
And everyone considered the 1994 price, just 10 percent less than its record, a triumph.
"It's the recognition we were waiting for," said Doris Ammann, a Zurich-based dealer who ran the business with her brother Thomas Ammann, a major Warhol collector, who died last year.
"It was a wonderful surprise."

After the cage of apartheid began to open up and the borders of his existence were no longer the pocked roads of Soweto, Vusi Makhubela found a peach-colored house in a white promised land with rose bushes and a two-car garage.
It was there that he knelt with his family in a corner of his bedroom to thank the ancestors for the family's good fortune.
He sprinkled tobacco on the carpet, because the ancestors must have their snuff, and marked the sacred spot with his deceased father's wooden walking stick.
Outside he planted a tiny sapling, which he named Watch Us Grow.


Food Industry Groups Sue to Stop U.S. Testing of Ground Beef
Seven food industry trade associations have filed a lawsuit to stop the Department of Agriculture from testing ground beef for bacteria that may be responsible for as many as 500 deaths a year.
At a news conference on Tuesday, several of the associations asserted that the testing program was illegal because the Agriculture Department lacked the authority to regulate bacteria in meat.
In addition they said the program was unfair because the sampling size was too small to reflect accurately or guarantee the safety of ground meat.


Shades of the Go-Go 80's: Takeovers in a Comeback
The deals are not as big, the fees are not as fat and the personalities are not as flamboyant.
Still, corporate takeovers are back.
With two months to go until the end of the year, 1994 is on track to be the second-biggest year for mergers and acquisitions in history.
As of Oct. 31, deals valued at $284.4 billion were announced, according to the Securities Data Company, a Wall Street research firm.
That is just shy of the $292.9 billion announced in all of 1989.
The record is $335.8 billion in 1988.

Judge Rules Fiske Removal Was Ethical
A Federal appeals judge has ruled that no ethics rules were violated by Judge David B. Sentelle, who dismissed the Whitewater independent counsel shortly after having lunch with the counsel's harshest critic in the Senate.
The counsel, Robert B. Fiske Jr., was replaced three months ago by a special three-judge panel headed by Judge Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
The panel instead chose Kenneth W. Starr, a Solicitor General in the Bush Administration who has been critical of President Clinton.


Fed Report Said to Point To Rate Rise
With unemployment falling most places and every region of the American economy growing, manufacturers are beginning to raise prices, the Federal Reserve said in a report released today.
Private economists interpreted the report, prepared with contributions from each of the 12 regional Fed banks, as another sign that the central bank is likely to raise interest rates again soon.
Today's report on the health of regional economies, known as the beige book, pointed to accelerating economic growth in the regions surrounding Minneapolis, Chicago, Dallas and Philadelphia, and steady growth almost everywhere else in the country.
The only conspicuous exception to the Fed's overall optimism lay in New York State and the Connecticut and New Jersey suburbs of New York City.
The region's economy continued to recover in October but the pace of that growth slowed, the Fed said.

Rowland Leads in Bundled Donations by Linked Contributors, Study Finds
Large campaign donations by groups of linked contributors, a phenomenon known as bundling, accounted for more than 9 percent of the money raised through early last month by John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate for governor, according to a study released today by Common Cause, the nonpartisan government watchdog group.
Executives and employees at 13 companies gave Mr.
Rowland $264,650 out of a total of $2.83 million raised, the group said.
Executives, employees and spouses related to just two interconnected companies, USCO Distribution Services of Naugatuck, and the Shannon Hotel Group of Florida, gave Mr.
Rowland $66,750, the report said, by far the highest amount contributed to any one candidate in the race.

The announcement came as Snapple, a Long Island success story that once was a Wall Street darling and the toast of iced-tea fanciers, reported that its third-quarter profit had plunged 74 percent on 6 percent lower sales.

Earth Wind and Fire's Ethic Survives
If virtuosity could save the world, Earth Wind and Fire would have done the job by now.
From 1975 to the early 1980's, Earth Wind and Fire was one of the most popular bands on Earth, singing about love and backing its utopian wishes with music that fused gospel sentiments, funk syncopation, pop melody, jazz harmonies and Latin rhythms.
At its peak, Earth Wind and Fire came up with music that was both ingenious and embracing, proffering hope and reassurance through cross-cultural synergy.
It was generous music, with an abundance of harmonizing voices and deftly deployed horns.
But it couldn't stand up to the corrosive 1980's, when best-selling black pop polarized into bare-bones, confrontational hip-hop or plush come-ons.
Now, Earth Wind and Fire is an oldies act, but still popular enough to sell out two nights at the Beacon Theater.
"We're going to take you back to the 70's," Philip Bailey declared on Tuesday.
It's a reconstituted band.
Maurice White, the band's founder, producer and main songwriter, no longer tours with it; he has taken with him his kalimba, the African thumb piano that was a band trademark.
Along with Mr.
Bailey, the current lineup includes only two other longtime members, Verdine White on bass and Ralph Johnson on vocals and percussion.

In a case that has already strained relations between Paris and Teheran, three Iranians went on trial here today for the 1991 slaying of Shahpur Bakhtiar, an exiled former Iranian Prime Minister.
French prosecutors are expected to argue that the killing had Iranian Government approval.
One of the three men is charged with killing Mr.

Six more Iranians, including two who supposedly took part in the killing, are to be tried in absentia.

Steven Hoffenberg, the brash New York financier accused by Federal prosecutors last year of running one of the largest swindles of recent times, has agreed to out-of-court settlements in the two most significant civil fraud suits against him.
But those settlements offer little hope to the thousands of people who had invested more than $415 million in Mr.
Hoffenberg's failed flagship company, the Towers Financial Corporation, from 1988 to 1993, because it is unlikely that the money can be collected.

N.H.L. Players Threaten to Reduce Playoffs
While the National Hockey League chopped 10 more games from its damaged regular season today, its locked-out players union met here and discussed the possibility of retaliating by threatening not to play some post-season games.
Such a move would hurt owners more than players because playoff games generate higher ticket prices and profits, as well as more television revenue, under the terms of the league's television contract, which is heavily weighted toward playoff games.

The device, Norplant, prevents pregnancy for five years with one insertion and had already been promoted as a breakthrough in contraception for teen-agers because it would not require daily pill taking.
But it has raised concerns among specialists in family planning that its use might have some unwanted consequences.

Bank Plan Would Rescue Co-ops Hurt by Recession
Throwing a financial lifeline to scores of cooperative apartment buildings in New York City, a consortium of banks has put up $100 million to help rescue co-ops that were hit hard when the real estate market collapsed in the late 1980's, and to help new buyers obtain mortgages.
Officials estimated that the program could involve 6,000 to 7,000 apartments in 150 to 200 buildings.
Many are in middle-income buildings in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn that were brought to the brink of collapse after their sponsors went bankrupt when apartment sales fell far short of expectations.

Even as the Helmsian hordes of the religious right thunderingly denounce pornography and licentiousness, even as the latest sex survey contends that Americans are not really very promiscuous, television pursues a scenario that might be titled "Sex Unplugged." Obviously, the stuff still sells, so barriers continue to be challenged in what is, after all, a gloriously free market.
Sort of.
Television is hardly alone in battering once traditional taboos.
Take, for instance, male frontal nudity.
In the theater, this used to be limited to the artsy avant-garde or touchy-feely counterculture musicals like "Hair." But suddenly New York stage actors are casually strutting the boards not only giving but showing their all (e.g.: Terrence McNally's "Love! Valour! Compassion!")


For This Jewelry, A Jewel-Box Shop
THE new boutique called Elizabeth Locke at Peipers &amp; Kojen, 968 Madison Avenue (at 76th Street), is possibly the smallest on the avenue, at 200 square feet.
"It's a jewel box itself," said the architect Stover Jenkins, who lined the walls with mahogany and designed the bronze display cases.
"Like the jewelry, its grandeur is packed in a small volume," he said.
"It all came down to proportion and materials."
Elizabeth Locke designs classically inspired, one-of-a-kind hand-hammered gold settings for pieces she finds on her world journeys: ancient coins, antique Italian micromosaics, 19th-century Venetian glass intaglios.

Sports of The Times; Can Foreman Try to Rope A Dope, Too?
IN two months, George Foreman will be 46.
Even in a boxing era when the marquee is more important than the man, that's old.
And it's not as if big George has been a winner or even been busy.
When he challenges Michael Moorer for two of the world's three heavyweight titles Saturday night in Las Vegas, Nev., he will be in a ring for the first time since he lost to Tommy Morrison 17 months ago.
Over the last four years, he has had only five bouts; he also lost to Evander Holyfield in his 1991 title shot.


The Siren Song of the Sports Center
IN an era when a school's athletic centers can be a bigger student draw than its educational programs, New York architects are being commissioned to design ever more spectacular gyms.
The most recent to open is a $12 million, 60,000-square-foot athletic center for 3,000 students at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J.
It was created by David Finci, a principal of the recently merged Hillier/Eggers Group in New York, now the fifth-largest architectural firm in the United States.

Hanover Ensemble Plays Schumann
The Hanover Band, a British period-instrument ensemble that has been toiling in the fields of early Romanticism since 1980, offered its concert at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday as a benefit for the Royal Society for Nature Conservation.
That, at least, was the official billing, and to make things sufficiently ceremonial, the performance was attended by the Duke of Kent, who is listed as the orchestra's patron, and Sir David Attenborough, who is the nature society's president.
The orchestra's unofficial agenda, though, was to celebrate the release of its set of Schumann symphonies by BMG Classics, and for the occasion the 74-member enemble and its conductor, Roy Goodman, gave a performance of the Fourth (Op. 120) that was the highlight of an uneven evening.
Using the 1841 version rather than the more common revision of a decade later, Mr.
Goodman drew bright string and brass sonorities, crisp attacks and unified ensemble playing from his band.
And in the finale, the players followed his animated beat with an enlivening rambunctiousness.


Pritchard Season Over
Denver placed wide receiver MIKE PRITCHARD on the injured-reserve list yesterday, ending his season.
Pritchard, 25, was a key off-season acquisition by the Broncos, having caught 201 passes in his first three pro seasons with Atlanta.
But on Sept. 23, he suffered a lacerated kidney in practice and was hospitalized for 11 days.
He has been unable to work out and has missed five games.
Pritchard underwent a CAT scan yesterday.
It showed that his kidney was healing but that a slight laceration remained. (AP)

President Ernesto Perez Balladares, a wealthy businessman who took office in September, has said modernizing the economy and reducing poverty are his top priorities for Panama, where more than half the 2.5 million people live in poverty and unemployment is officially about 14 percent.

Market Place; Big Winners, Big Losers In Snapple's Life Story
As a public company, the Snapple Beverage Corporation may not make it to its second birthday.
But its short life story is a fascinating one.
Those who got in before the company was sold to the public made more than $1 billion.
Those who got in within the first few weeks Snapple was public did very well as it became one of the hottest offerings in years.
But almost all those who bought Snapple more than six months after it went public will emerge poorer for the experience.
Some, mostly the public owners of the stock, will lose more than half the money they invested.

U.S. Says Many Arab Lands Back Aid Bank
The Clinton Administration insisted today that its hopes of establishing a multibillion-dollar development bank for the Middle East were not dead and that many Arab countries were open to contributing to it.
Although Administration officials acknowledged that several Arab countries had not committed money to the bank, they said these countries had given a green light to the idea at a conference in Casablanca by setting up a study group on how to structure and finance the bank.

Mr. Ames Exposed More Than Spies
It is now clear beyond doubt that Aldrich Ames turned the old cold-war game of spy versus spy into a total rout -- in the Soviets' favor.
According to a Senate Intelligence Committee report, Mr.
Ames managed to betray most U.S. and allied espionage operations in the Soviet Union from 1985 on.
His treachery resulted in the exposure and rolling up of over 100 spy operations, the "loss of virtually all of C.I.A.'s intelligence assets targeted at the Soviet Union," the deaths of at least a dozen prized Soviet agents and the exposure of other Soviet agents who were then forced to feed false information back to Western intelligence.


Political Choices in New Jersey; Balloting for the House -- and Homes
Two Congressional races in northern New Jersey rate special notice.
In one, a one-term incumbent has a tight contest.
In the other, the seat is open.
Eighth District (parts of Essex and Passaic Counties): This seat has been Democratic for decades, but a Republican, William Martini, a lawyer and former Assistant U.S.
Attorney, is giving Herb Klein, a first-term Representative, a stiff challenge.


Nude Cellist and Video Chaos, in Reprise
Seoul-Nymax: A Celebration of Arts Without Borders is an ambitious monthlong festival that sprawls through South Korean contemporary dance and electronic arts, classic and new multimedia work and the art of Fluxus, the post-Dadaist movement of the 1950's and 60's here and abroad.
The festival got off to an intriguing start on Oct. 8 with a program that featured a concert by Vytautas Landsbergis, the piano-playing first president of free Lithuania.
But "Drama 20/21," a comprehensive tribute to Fluxus that suggested both its history and its meaning today, promises to have been the oddest event in the festival.
The program, at Anthology Film Archives on Tuesday night, was for the most part a celebration of the blithe, wired spirits of the 1960's.
It offered a series of high jinks on a stage covered with electronic equipment, preserved for posterity by an audience armed with still and video cameras and tape recorders.
But the evening began with an homage to Charlotte Moorman, the topless video-cellist of the 60's, that proved to be as nuanced and touching as it was funny.


Lowell Johnson, 82, Business Consultant

BUSINESS DIGEST
The Economy  Corporate takeovers are back, but without some of the flash and excess of the 1980's.
This year is likely to be the second biggest for mergers and acquisitions, after $335.8 billion in 1988.
Companies that slashed costs in the early 1990's are now looking to increase their revenue, and acquisition is an easy way to do it.  [ Page A1. ] Manufacturers are beginning to raise prices as the recovery picks up speed, the Federal Reserve said in its September survey of regional economies, known as the beige book.  [ D1. ]

Psychoanalyst Loses Libel Suit Against a New Yorker Reporter
A jury in Federal District Court here may have finally ended the long-running saga of Janet Malcolm and Jeffrey M. Masson.
It ruled today that while two of five disputed quotations Ms.
Malcolm attributed to Mr.
Masson in a 1983 profile of the psychoanalyst in The New Yorker magazine were false and one of those was defamatory, none were written with the recklessness required for libel.
The verdict, from a panel of seven women and one man, culminated -- and may well conclude -- nearly 10 years of litigation in which the case reached the United States Supreme Court once and juries twice, consumed a fortune in legal fees and triggered a debate over what constitutes quotations and the license reporters may take with them.

The tribute, which is open to the public, will be held in the Newman Theater, with additional seating in the Shiva, Anspacher and LuEsther Theaters, where there will be video monitors.
There will also be loudspeakers in the lobby of the Newman and on the sidewalk outside.

Bosnians and Croats Continue Pounding Serbs
Contingents of the mostly Muslim Bosnian Army and the Croatian militia advanced overnight and today in fighting around the Bosnian Serb-held town of Kupres, following up on the most significant Serbian setbacks of the war, local media reports said.
The official Croatian news agency reported tonight that units of the Bosnian Croat militia, the Croatian Defense Council, were overrunning Bosnian Serb forces south and west of Kupres and had surrounded the Serbian-held village of Rilic, driven the Serbs from Donji Malovan and seized "significant" quantities of weapons and ammunition.


Corrections
An article on Tuesday about Consolidated Edison's guilty plea in a case involving the release of asbestos in a 1989 steam pipe explosion in Manhattan referred imprecisely to the admissions made by a former company executive, Constantine J. Papakrasas.
He pleaded guilty to failure to report the asbestos release to a Federal agency, not to having concealed the information.
And while Con Edison has acknowledged that more than 200 pounds of asbestos was released in the explosion, Mr.
Papakrasas did not say tests immediately after the blast showed that such an amount was released.


Improvising In the Style Of the 1960's
The pianist Rachel Z performed the Herbie Hancock composition "Eye of the Hurricane" in the middle of her first set at the Iridium on Tuesday night, and it swung.
Her group, Dave Liebman on soprano saxophone, Ron Carter on bass and Lenny White on drums, dug into the rhythm of the piece.
Mr.
Carter, who was on the original recording, prodded the rest of the band into a bristling, exciting performance.
Rachel Z is a disciple of the literate, harmonically probing jazz that was produced in the 1960's, and her improvisations rang with the sounds of McCoy Tyner and Mr.
Hancock.
At their best, they had a sense of play to them.

It's Quantity Rather Than Quality at Nets' Center Spot
Butch Beard, the first-year coach, might have to make the decision with his allocation of minutes.
Willis Reed, the general manager, could concoct a last-minute trade and save Beard the trouble.
Either way, the Nets need to take a long, hard look into their forest of big men and begin whittling.
No less than five players are competing for minutes at the center position, and after the 7-foot Benoit Benjamin it is anyone's guess who will secure playing time this weekend as the club leaves for a three-game Texas trip to begin the regular season.

"It's a collaboration between the wood and myself," says the M.I.T.-trained architect turned sculptor.
The elegant reliefs succeed as both sculptures and pictorial compositions.
Brosk sets up a powerful tension in each piece by combining warm, fine-grained old cherry with cool, dense dark slate.
His solo exhibition, through Nov. 19 at the Stephen Rosenberg Gallery in SoHo, is of wall sculptures, though Mr.
Brosk also accepts commissions for furniture and large outdoor installations.

Strike Prevents Delivery of San Francisco Daily Newspapers
Employees of this city's two major daily newspapers, longtime rivals that have limped along under a joint operating agreement since 1965, went on strike Tuesday night as 2,600 reporters, editors, drivers, press operators and paper handlers walked off the job.
They had been working without a contract for the past year.
The work stoppage at The Chronicle and The Examiner, the first at the newspapers since a 52-day walkout in 1968, began a day after the original Halloween strike deadline set by eight unions had been extended for a flurry of last-minute negotiations.
But the talks failed, and while hundreds of thousands of papers for Wednesday were printed, few if any reached readers' hands.


Foreman Shedding Nice Guy Profile

Saying he regretted that he had taken it easy on opponents, Foreman implied that he would try to kill the heavyweight champion Michael Moorer in their bout here Saturday night.

Israeli Woman Sues for Chance to Be a Combat Pilot

A civilian pilot who loves to fly and had once written to NASA about becoming an astronaut, she was not even considered for the air force because Israel bars women from combat.

A Playwright's Post-Beckett Period
Twenty years ago, Marina Carr, Ireland's most celebrated young playwright, was a girl of 9 putting on plays in the garage of her home in the hamlet of Pallas Lake, deep in the quiet of the rustic Irish Midlands.
Her family, she says, was one of "rural literary pretension." Her mother, whose first language was Gaelic, wrote unpublished poems in that language.
Her father, Hugh, is a minor playwright.
Miss Carr had no high hopes, but she knew she liked words and playacting.

"Are any of you going to require Mr. Simpson and his lawyers to solve these killings and identify the real killers?" the lawyer, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., asked potential jurors this morning.

Dow Off 26.24 in 3d Consecutive Loss
Stock prices tumbled yesterday for a third consecutive session, despite a series of efforts by the Federal Reserve to support the falling dollar.
Stocks rose in early trading when the Fed, acting as agent for the Treasury Department, bought a billion or so dollars and sold German marks and Japanese yen in the currency markets.
But this action was not enough to prevent losses for the day in both stocks and bonds.
A weak dollar increases the possibility of higher inflation and discourages investment from abroad.


Japanese Pass Bills On Electoral Reform
After more than four years of battling, the lower house of Parliament today passed the final versions of bills to set up a new electoral system and to toughen campaign financing laws, part of a long-promised effort to clean up Japan's scandal-haunted politics.
Approval of the bills, which included detailed outlines of the 300 new electoral districts, means that the bitterly contested laws can take effect in December.
As a result, the next parliamentary elections will be held under the new system, and thus could profoundly alter the balance of power in Parliament and further realign the battered party system.

Cowboys Have Easy Rumbles In the East
They lost their head coach, who is sunning himself in Florida, and still the Dallas Cowboys haven't lost a beat.
When their offensive coordinator bolted to the nation's capital to try and pull the Washington Redskins back to respectability, the Cowboys didn't worry.
If someone dropped a bomb in the middle of their locker room, it seems, the Cowboys wouldn't worry.
An incredible amount of talent and skill and work ethic have made the Cowboys almost indestructible.

Tight end Jay Novacek, one of the best in the business, has missed games because of stomach injury, and the beat goes on.
They lose the Pro Bowl offensive tackle Erik Williams for the season after a car wreck, and still nothing slows them down.

AWAY FROM HOME WITH: Liz Carpenter; With Three, She Gets Nine Inch Nails
LIZ CARPENTER is having a great book tour.
Sure, there are parties in every city, given by social and prestigious names -- "Age blesses you with a bounty of friends," she said -- but that's not it.
It's just that after a long drought, she's enjoying adult conversation, is happily ignoring the vagaries of who's who in the rock world and has wiped the word "homework" from her vocabulary.
Well, at least for a couple of months.
Ms.
Carpenter, at 74, is the unexpected mother of three teen-agers, and her new book, "Unplanned Parenthood: The Confessions of a Seventysomething Surrogate Mother" (Random House), is a tale of how it all came about.
It's as down-to-earth as its author, which means it's mostly funny, sometimes hilarious and occasionally outrageous.
For although Ms.
Carpenter, with her comfortable figure, halo of gray hair and sincere blue eyes, looks like the grandmothers-who-used-to-be, she isn't.
Even in her native Texas, a state not short of characters, she's in the upper echelon of the breed, and that has nothing to do with the fact that she was bitten by a mad dog at age 6.

Martin Stryker, 51, Blood Plasma Expert
Dr.
Martin H. Stryker, an official of the New York Blood Center who helped make the clotting factors derived from blood plasma safe for hemophiliacs, died on Sunday in Long Island Jewish Hospital in New Hyde Park, L.I.
He was 51 and lived in Jericho, L.I.
The cause was complications from gall bladder surgery, said his wife, Margaret.


With its fourth Miller Lite campaign in three years, an agency hopes consumers are thirsty for change.
IT would be far too harsh when discussing advertising for Miller Lite to repeat the familiar remark about mercurial weather -- that those who dislike it should stick around because it will change any minute.
After all, there's nothing wrong with a rainstorm being suddenly replaced by a rainbow.
And ad changes can be good, too.
Few consumers would still want to be watching the "Miller Lite All-Stars," that irksome gang of aging former athletes, has-been comedians and never-were celebrities who once brashly promoted the beer brand.


Kormeada Journal; The Unforgiven in Ethiopia: Its Refugee Families
Fanta Belete had lived in Eritrea for 17 years when Ethiopia fell to rebel troops in 1991.
He gathered his wife and children and joined an exodus of more than 200,000 people expelled by the Eritrean nationalist rebels, who were allied with the Ethiopians who won the war.
Many of those forced to leave were soldiers of the defeated army or Ethiopian civil servants who had worked for the ousted Marxist Government of Mengistu Haile Mariam.


Offensive Defense Mark
After wading through stacks of records, the National Football League confirmed yesterday that Minnesota cornerback Anthony Parker is the first defensive player to score touchdowns in three straight games.
Parker, getting his first chance to start after five injury-plagued seasons, returned an interception 41 yards for a touchdown against Tampa Bay on Sunday, returned a fumble 23 yards against Green Bay on Oct. 20 and an interception 44 yards against the Giants last Sunday. (AP)


CHRONICLE
The novelist HERMAN WOUK, 79, made a rare public appearance yesterday at a luncheon at the National Press Club in Washington.
He and his wife, BETTY SARAH WOUK, still keep a house in the capital, where he lived for a number of years while researching his two World War II novels, "Winds of War" and "War and Remembrance." Now they live in Palm Springs, Calif., which, Mr.
Wouk noted, "is sometimes described rather unfeelingly as God's waiting room."
The title of his talk was "Education of a Writer," and he described "the strange arch of my work that goes from gag writing for Fred Allen to World War II and Israel."


Cowboys' Smith Is Unhurt in Auto Mishap
The Dallas Cowboys running back EMMITT SMITH escaped injury in a two-car collision yesterday morning.

Retired Admiral Assails Senator Over Sex Harassment Complaint
In an unusual personal attack, the former commander of the Navy's Atlantic Fleet has lashed out at Senator Patty Murray for trying to delay his retirement because of what she said was his mishandling of a sexual harassment complaint.
Senator Murray, Democrat of Washington, led an unsuccessful effort to hold a hearing on the officer, Adm.
Henry H. Mauz Jr., before he was retired at four-star rank.
A Navy lawyer, Lieut.
Darlene Simmons, had accused Admiral Mauz of failing to protect her from reprisals by other officers after she made accusations of sexual harassment.
Admiral Mauz denied this.


Fuss Over Photos of Mitterrand's Other Child
Breaking a French taboo on press revelations about the private lives of public figures, Paris-Match magazine published photographs today of a young woman whom it described as President Francois Mitterrand's daughter, who was born out of wedlock.
The magazine's decision promptly set off a stormy debate, but not about Mr.
Mitterrand's morals.
Rather, Paris-Match was roundly criticized by French politicians and journalists for dragging the French press toward the muck-raking practices of British and American tabloids.


Speeder Hunted After Father and Son Are Killed
They shared the same name and did almost everything together.
And on Wednesday night, the police said, the father and son died side by side when their car was hit by a vehicle that sped through a red light.
The collision threw Jesse Solomon, 67, and his 41-year-old son, Jesse Jr., from their seats as the other driver fled the scene.
The accident, which injured two other people, was one more instance in which a bad driver took someone's life, the police said, and this time it left a woman mourning both her husband and son.

Developments yesterday in campaigns in New York and New Jersey. NEW YORK
Governor: Al Gordon, chairman of the state Democratic Party, filed a complaint with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics accusing Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of using his Congressional franking privileges to help Mr.
Pataki.
Mr.
Gordon said that while none of the mail mentioned Mr.
Pataki by name, the messages were coordinated with those of the gubernatorial candidate.
Zenia Mucha, Mr.
Pataki's spokeswoman, said, "Al Gordon has lost every marble he's ever had in that puny little brain of his, and this sets a new stand for desperation."


Tall Ships and High Expectations in Bridgeport
Anna Prizzia, 17, grew up dreaming about a life at sea and a career involving ships, especially tall ships.
Today, she was on hand with her classmates from the Bridgeport Aquaculture School, a magnet school, as several tall ships arrived at Captains Cove Seaport here for a convention of the American Sail Training Association.


Group Shows: One Groovy, One Graphic, One Grating
Group shows are a mixed blessing.
Designers showing together with corporate sponsorship risk being morphed into one blob of trend and fabric, while designers who may never show get the chance to offer a concise and tantalizing morsel of their works.
Group shows can never be better than the sum of the parts, but when sponsors pick strong designers and let them show a range of work in one block, these shows are a real service.

Sports of The Times; Antidote For Reality: Box Scores
YOU want to know why Americans are so disillusioned with politicians this year?
That's what the front page said yesterday, and I just figured it out.
No baseball.
No hockey.
In normal times, we depend on our daily fix of sports to keep us amused.
Deprived of our rituals, some of us have inadvertently been exposed to political candidates.
We turn on the tube and listen to some guy in California explaining why he's against foreigners coming to this country, but he has got some kind of moral dispensation to hire an illegal alien.
In New York, a candidate has commercials that blatantly urge Jews not to vote for his black opponent.
In Montana, there's a guy running for re-election who's proud of voting for lobbyists who buy him supper.
How long has this been going on?


Critic's Choice/Film; Calm During a Storm: Celebrating Bresson
These days, Robert Bresson may be the least-shown of master film makers.
His signature style is the clear-sighted film that serenely explores emotional and social upheavals, like "Diary of a Country Priest," the 1950 tale of a quiet priest's religious crises.
"The Devil, Probably" is a late, little-known Bresson film that takes the same calm approach to a world crumbling from the inside out.
The film was shown at the 1977 New York Film Festival, then virtually disappeared from the United States until today, when it begins a weeklong run at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.
The film, set in contemporary Paris, begins with a newspaper account of a young man's suicide, then flashes back to the final six months of his life.
Charles is 20 and in despair over a meaningless life.
With his head hanging down, and his long hair parted in the center and hanging over his face like curtains, he seems a fragile, Christ-like creature.
He has lost interest in the causes that consume his closest friends.
One leads an environmental group; another hands out anti-clerical pamphlets in church.
And when Charles finally sees a psychiatrist, the advice he gets is the most dangerous of all.
Who controls such a world?
"The devil, probably," says a man on a bus engaged in a typical Bressonian philosophical argument.


A Psychiatrist Who Falls For a Knife-Wielding Psycho
B movies used to look cheaper than their higher-class counterparts, but today they can have the antiseptically affluent look of a television show.
Not to mention the cast: "A Passion to Kill" stars Scott Bakula ("Quantum Leap") as a California psychiatrist who falls for his best friend's wife (Chelsea Field, the mom in "Andre," the summer's pet-seal movie) despite the warnings of his ex-girlfriend (Sheila Kelley of "L.A. Law").
"A Passion to Kill" also has the abundance of close-ups and medium shots that suggest television or video is its natural home.
It does have a B-movie screenplay (by William Delligan) with some inadvertent merriment.
The fun is enhanced because we know Diana (Ms. Field) to be a knife-wielding psycho and David (Mr. Bakula), despite his psychiatric training, hasn't a clue.
David seems to be better at racquet sports and drinking orange juice out of the carton than he is at fathoming the mysteries of the human mind.

Mohammed Ali, his hands and feet caked with dried gray mud, hiked up his flowing white robes and waded into a murky canal running by the smoldering remains of this farm town where at least 400 people and possibly as many as 600 perished in floods and fire this week.
"I have been here since dawn," he explained, as he plodded down the embankment.
"We usually find the small children in groups of three or four. Most of them drowned. But the adults are so badly burned we often do not know who they are."

Mamet's Lesson in Sexual Harassment
For David Mamet, conversation is a blood sport and words are lethal weapons.
In "Oleanna," his incendiary play about sexual harassment, a college student and her professor pace around his office hurling words at each other, actions that inspired knock-down-drag-out verbal fights in theater lobbies when the play was first produced.
But that was in 1992, when the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings were still fresh in our minds.
Since then, sexual harassment has sometimes dominated the news, as in the Tailhook and West Point scandals, or in Paula Jones's accusations against President Clinton.
And the issue has even become fodder for popular entertainment, as in Michael Crichton's best-selling novel "Disclosure," coming up as a Christmas movie.
Now this faithful, flat-footed screen version, directed by Mr.
Mamet, offers a reminder that "Oleanna" was always more effective as a debate topic than a work of drama.
Its two characters, Carol and John, are puppets manipulated by their creator, which makes "Oleanna" less volatile today than when it was the only sexual-harassment game in town.


Anderson Wants a Peek at the Prize Before Nets Take On the Champions
Kenny Anderson said he might ask Kenny Smith, his close friend and backcourt counterpart with the Houston Rockets, to show him his championship ring on Friday night.
There is nothing wrong with peeking at basketball's ultimate accomplishment, Anderson, the Nets' point guard, reasoned.
And since his club is in Houston for its opener against the defending champion Rockets, well, what's the harm?


Campaigns Focus on 2 Views of West
When the Democrats won the West in the 1992 Presidential election, they took it as a mandate to phase out century-old Government subsidies that were used to lure people and industry to the trackless corners of America's public lands.
Almost immediately, Republicans called this shift "a war on the West," and said it would cost Democrats what had been their best showing in the region in 30 years.
The slogan transferred easily to bumper stickers throughout the rural West, and has become a mantra in this year's midterm elections.


Redistricting Heats Up Election Races; Giuliani's Real Motive
To the Editor:
William Safire presents a distorted picture of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's endorsement of Mario M. Cuomo in the race for New York governor (column, Oct. 27).
Casting the move as the latest round in a personal feud, Mr.
Safire depicts a vindictive Mayor betraying the Republican Party to spurn Senator Alfonse D'Amato, his onetime sponsor and now bitter foe.

Detroit Sets Truck Records As Vehicle Sales Jump 8.9%
Drawn by the fresh curves of some 1995 vehicles and the reduced prices on 1994 models, customers continued to flock to new car dealerships in October, buying 8.9 percent more cars and light trucks than were sold during the brisk period a year earlier, the auto makers reported today.
During October, the first month of the 1995 model year, sales of cars rose 2.9 percent, to 738,221, while sales of light trucks -- pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles -- rose 18.8 percent, to 525,285.

Oliver Mayer's "Blade to the Heat" is a one-alarm play, but it is getting a four-alarm production at the Joseph Papp Public Theater.
It begins with the growling of wild beasts and ends with a boxing match as brutal as you are likely to see on a stage.
In between, the lights throb, the bloodthirsty crowds roar and two drummers, as if possessed, beat a mad tattoo on the congas.
Flashbulbs rip holes in the darkness, already fouled by clouds of smoke.
Even the scene changes are explosive: the stagehands seem to be running for their lives.

Downhill After the Los Angeles Riots
"Am I losing my mind? Am I sick?" worries John Boyz (James Le Gros), the unemployed, 30-something narrator of Peter McCarthy's brave but misguided contemporary satire, "Floundering." The Los Angeles riots have barely subsided, and John, who lives in Venice Beach, is haunted by what he calls a "pervasive feeling of doom." His edgy mood is made worse by his morbid habit of obsessively replaying his own homemade videotapes of the riots.
Prominently featured in those videos is Merryl Fence (Nelson Lyon), a Los Angeles police chief who suggests a monstrous caricature of the real-life Daryl F. Gates.
John seems almost eager for disaster to strike, and on one especially terrible day it finally does.
In the space of a few hours, he discovers that the Internal Revenue Service has put a lien on his savings account, his unemployment compensation has run out, and his brother has fled a drug rehabilitation clinic.
Seeking solace from his girlfriend, Jessica (Lisa Zane), he finds her in bed with another man.

Give 'Em an Eph! Oozing Excellence at Williams
When it comes to athletics, there is little humility to be found on this idyllic campus.
Rather, the Ephs (the college was founded in 1793 by Col. Ephraim Williams) take for granted victory after victory and championship after championship.
Tomorrow, the unbeaten football team that has outscored six opponents by 238-38 plays host to Wesleyan in its first Little Three game.
Williams has won its last 14 Little Three games.
In fact, Williams teams have defeated Amherst and Wesleyan so often that the Ephs are no longer awarded those Little Three plaques, at $14 each.


Champion Account Goes to Merkley
The Champion Products division of the Sara Lee Corporation, which markets sportswear and other casual apparel, said yesterday that it had named Merkley Newman Harty in New York to handle its account, previously at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising in New York.

After a two-month review, Merkley Newman was chosen over two other New York-based finalists, Angotti, Thomas, Hedge and Deutsch Inc.


Ireland's Premier Assures Protestants in North of Their Rights
Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said today that his Government was prepared to approve a radical change in the Constitution of the Irish Republic to assure the people of Northern Ireland, with its Protestant majority, that they would never be subsumed into a united Ireland against their will.
Mr.
Reynolds said that he hoped his promise, made publicly and specifically for the first time, would assuage Protestant fears and speed the peace proposal he advanced last December with Prime Minister John Major of Britain.
He said he hoped that in return, Britain would give up its claim to sovereignty, something he said he thought was possible.


On Stage, and Off
Jerry, Yes Almost. Tina, No for Sure.
Casting plans for musicals usually exist somewhere between bright idea and official announcement.
The name for that limbo is rumor, and there are two in town about casting right now.
The "Jerry Lewis is replacing Victor Garber as the Devil in 'Damn Yankees' " one seems headed out of limbo.
"Jerry's had lunch with the producers and director," a man involved in the production said.
"He's interested and they're interested, as long as he wants to do serious acting, not the gags and the buck teeth." Other ideas batted around "Yankees," he said, were Joel Grey or "someone of color, like Greg Hines," which is a fairly cynical expression of the theory that a black star can revitalize a box office by drawing black theatergoers, as Vanessa Williams did for "Kiss of the Spider Woman."
Which brings us to rumor No. 2.
Tina Turner replacing Vanessa Williams?
Denied -- believably.
"No, honestly, we haven't even been approached about it," said Roger Davies, Ms.
Turner's manager.
"Tina doesn't even want to work until 1996. She's living in Europe now." And Mary Bryant, a spokeswoman for the show, which is produced by Garth Drabinsky, said: "It sounds like an old rumor getting recycled. Garth used to talk about getting Vanessa, or Tina Turner, or Cher, or Janet Jackson, or Diana Ross, when Chita Rivera left."


Embryo Sheds Light on Dinosaurs' Origin
In a discovery that should begin to round out knowledge of the full life cycle of dinosaurs, paleontologists exploring the Gobi Desert of Mongolia have found the first fossilized embryo of a meat-eating dinosaur.
Only six or seven other dinosaur embryos are known to science, and none is as exquisitely preserved as this one.
Curled up and resting in part of its oblong egg, the specimen looks very much like a tiny dinosaur on the half-shell.
With tail and all, the fully extended embryo would probably measure eight inches long.
But it is still in the fetal position, the head tucked near the knees.
A hand is over the face.
Except for the missing pieces of the tail and the top of the skull, everything about the skeleton seems complete, with individual vertebrae, pelvic bones and limbs all well formed and clearly identifiable.


Despite the Distractions, Ward Keeps Riding High
McLain Ward's world is horses.
At the age of 19, he has some remarkable accomplishments to his credit, and he plans to have many more in the years to come.
He plans this despite the distractions caused by his father's recent indictment on charges of being part of a group charged with killing horses to collect insurance benefits.
The indictment is something Ward avoids discussing even with casual friends on the circuit, or at shows such as this week's National Horse Show at the Byrne Meadowlands Arena, the most prestigious of all United States equestrian events.


17 Warrant Evaders Are Arrested in Raids at Their Homes
In a new crackdown on those who fail to show up for court appearances, 17 people wanted for crimes from vandalism to robbery were arrested in early-morning raids yesterday at their homes in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.
Many of the offenders were rousted from their beds.
And as a result of the arrests, officers got information on one unsolved killing and several drug locations, said Capt.
Thomas J. Palazzo, commander of the 72d Precinct.


The 2 Wizards of the Smoke-and-Mirror Trade Guiding Cuomo and Pataki
One never talks to the press, and the other threatens not to but can't quite stop.
One works exclusively in his socks and eats only fried food, and the other is a rogue and a connoisseur.
One builds a campaign around a single, simple slogan and the other is the master of a million nuanced insinuations.
And in the last week of the New York governor's race, the strategists for the two main candidates are as different as the television commercials they have devised for their clients.
For George E. Pataki there is the reclusive Arthur Finkelstein, and for Mario M. Cuomo the unavoidable David Garth.


Raise the Hurdle for College Athletes
People who worry about education -- and how colleges exploit athletes without providing it -- will find some alarming news in "The Last Shot: City Streets, Basketball Dreams," Darcy Frey's new book about the sports obsession in America's poorest neighborhoods and public schools.
It is by now a familiar story that students who neglect their studies in quest of sports stardom end up jobless and without degrees when their college scholarships expire, even while the colleges themselves earn millions in revenues.

Cutting Legal Aid Costs
Like all cities, New York is constitutionally obliged to provide legal help for indigent defendants.
Unlike most cities, New York contracts the work to a private organization, the Legal Aid Society.
Despite a history of dedication to an often thankless job, the society has grown fat with age.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has correctly chosen to pare the fat.
That will cause the society financial pain.
But it may also bring about new ways of dealing with the city's immense criminal caseloads and better justice at lower cost.
Two factors moved the society into the Mayor's line of fire.
One was the city's budget crunch.
The other was the society's foolish two-day strike in September.
The strike, which Mr.
Giuliani halted with a threat to fire the society, strengthened his hand just at budget time.
Now he calls for a cheaper system -- $12.5 million less than the current budget of $79 million -- and a modern legal services contract to replace the one first signed in 1966.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; These days, getting out the vote means getting in your face.
JUST as advertisements for political candidates have evolved over the years to reflect changing attitudes, so, too, have advertisements that urge Americans to vote.
Earnestly straightforward public service announcements, appealing to people in sincere, measured tones to perform their civic duty, have been supplanted by sharper messages, more sophisticated and visceral, that seek to amuse, surprise or even shock.


Eli Lilly Deal Is Approved By the F.T.C.
The Federal Trade Commission gave conditional approval yesterday to Eli Lilly &amp; Company's $4 billion purchase of PCS Health Systems, the nation's biggest prescription drug benefit company, and made clear that it would keep similar deals under surveillance for possible antitrust violations.
In a consent order, Lilly agreed to keep the PCS system, which it is buying from the McKesson Corporation of San Francisco, open to drugs made by competitors.
Lilly will also build a "fire wall" to prevent it from competing unfairly by obtaining pricing information submitted to PCS by other drug makers.


Prasad Hopes to Avert Painful Stitch in Time
After 11 miles, Nadia Prasad of France felt the pain so sharply that she stopped running and doubled over.
Two or three miles later, the pain returned and she stopped again, breathing deeply and attempting to touch her nose to her knees.
Every runner has dealt with a stitch in the side.
But this was no training run.
This was the middle of the 1993 New York City Marathon.
"It felt like a knife poking me in the side," Prasad said in a recent telephone interview from her home in Boulder, Colo.
"I had started too fast, then I didn't know how to grab the water bottles. I was scared of them. I was drinking too fast and I got a stitch."


6 Astronauts Are Launched Into Space
The refurbished space shuttle Atlantis rocketed into orbit today on a planned 11-day mission to study Earth's atmosphere, particularly the effects of solar radiation interacting with man-made chemicals on the ozone layer high in the atmosphere, which protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet radiation.
It is the third shuttle flight in as many years to carry an array of environmental-science instruments called the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science, or Atlas.
On Friday, the astronauts are to deploy and later retrieve a German-built satellite for further atmospheric studies.


Bringing Action to Blind Theatergoers
Sitting on a chair at the back of the Marquis Theater, Laura Congleton watched "Damn Yankees" and described what she saw.
"Joe takes the pen," she said very softly, speaking into a tiny microphone.
"Signs the book. They shake hands. Applegate looks at the book and smiles." In the audience, four people listening to her on headsets understood, though they could not see.

Inside Art
A Gift From the Panzas
The Italian industrialist Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo and his wife, Countess Giovanna, continue to be strong international supporters of contemporary art.
This week, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles announced that the Panzas had given the museum 70 works, created over the last 12 years by 10 Los Angeles artists.
Among the artists are Lawrence Carroll, Jeff Colson, Gregory Mahoney, Peter Shelton, Mark Lere and Roy Thurston.
"I have been collecting Los Angeles artists for 30 years," Count Panza said in a telephone interview this week.
He joined the museum's board in 1980, and four years later he sold the museum 80 works of Abstract Expressionist and Pop art from his collection, for $11 million.
They included paintings and sculpture by Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg and Robert Rauschenberg.

A Scratch Nets Lukas An Extra Cup Edge
Two days before the Breeders' Cup series, Wayne Lukas's chances of scoring a sweep of the 2-year-old races got an unexpected boost today when a fever forced the withdrawal of Call Now, his chief threat in the Juvenile Fillies.
Nobody gets rich giving an edge to Lukas, especially this year when he comes roaring into the Breeders' Cup with a full deck: favorites in the two races for juveniles, including Flanders in the fillies and Timber Country in the colts; Chimes Band and Harlan in the Sprint, and Tabasco Cat in the Classic.
And the jockey on all his favorites will be Pat Day, the king of Churchill Downs.

Democrats Count on Little-Known Candidate for 'Insurance' in Senate Edge
The Democrats desperately need an insurance policy for next Tuesday's midterm elections, and they think they may have found one in Ann Wynia, their little-known Senate candidate in Minnesota.
She alone among the 13 Democrats who are running for Republican-held Senate seats this fall seems to have a real chance of winning.
The party's hopes in Wyoming, Delaware and Montana have withered in recent weeks, but if Ms.
Wynia can knock off her Republican rival, Representative Rod Grams, the Republicans will need to pick up eight Democratic seats, not seven, to take control of the Senate.


At the Bar; New television stars in the O. J. Simpson case galaxy: the lawyer-commentators.
One day not long ago, a local lawyer, Jay Jaffe, approached Roger Cossack, another member of the bar, in Nate and Al's, the venerable Beverly Hills delicatessen and agora.
"Rog, my ratings are higher than yours," Mr.
Jaffe declared.
"Nationally, but not internationally," Mr. Cossack replied.

Schools in Paterson Lagging On Standards, Report Says
Three years after the state took control of the ailing Paterson school district, student achievement still lags far behind state standards, according to a report by independent auditors released today.
The report, by the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen &amp; Company, found that in two of the district's three high schools fewer than 75 percent of the students passed the state high school proficiency test.
The report also found that attendance figures in the district were low, while the dropout rate was 17.6 percent.


Saluting -- or Doing In -- the Suburban Muse
There were actually a lot of women in her era that despised the notion of Laura Petrie, the highly saluted muse of this season.
So what if she wore pants?
She never used foul language or double-entendres.
She wasn't sexy or dangerous.
She certainly never wore anything provocative; she and her husband even slept in twin beds.
It seems that everyone, from Isaac Mizrahi, hawking dresses on the Nick at Nite cable channel, to the young design team of Finis, have had something to say about Laura Petrie.

Coach at Iowa State (0-7-1) Will Resign
JIM WALDEN, whose Iowa State football team is likely to face its first season without a victory since 1930, said last night that he will resign after the season.
Walden, in his eighth season as coach of the Ames, Iowa, university, said he was making the announcement to give the university a jump on finding a replacement.
Iowa State (0-7-1) finishes the season against Kansas State, Nebraska and Colorado -- all ranked in the nation's polls.


Williams Grand Jury to Review Blood Test
Grand jurors investigating an automobile accident involving a Cowboys offensive lineman, ERIK WILLIAMS, will be allowed to review a blood-alcohol test that was given after his admission to a hospital.
State District Judge MIKE KEASLER on Wednesday denied a request from Williams's attorneys to throw out the grand jury's subpoena for the test results.


The Race That Invective Forgot
Without a calendar, one could hardly guess that an election was in the offing.
On this brilliant autumn afternoon in the russet foothills of the Appalachians, Senator Robert C. Byrd was doing what he does best: waxing poetic about the glories of his state while he inaugurated something else in his name, the Robert C. Byrd Highway.


Unpaid Bills Hinder Work Of N.A.A.C.P.
The finances of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People are so fragile, several members of its board of directors have disclosed, that the association still owes hotels in Chicago and Indianapolis for its last two national conventions.
As a result of its poor credit, these board members say, the association is being forced to pay major expenses, like hotel room charges and air fares, in advance.
But because it cannot make these payments, they say, the 64-member board cannot even consider meeting to discuss a proposal to dismiss the group's chairman, Dr.
William F. Gibson.


Indonesia's Phony Cleanup
Indonesia's rulers see this month's Asia-Pacific economic summit meeting as a terrific opportunity to improve an international image stained by repression in East Timor and other serious human rights abuses.
How much more flattering to display a statesman-like President Suharto playing host to his counterparts from the U.S., China, Japan and a dozen other countries and touting the opportunities of the world's fourth-most-populous nation and one of its most vibrant economies.
Both images of Indonesia are true.
But its crude effort to shove all human rights problems out of camera range only highlights the repressive character of the regime.


Warm Weather Slowed Retail Sales in October
Mother Nature seems determined to keep merchants guessing about their prospects for the all-important holiday sales season, which officially begins the day after Thanksgiving.
The nation's chain stores said unseasonally balmy weather in several parts of the country contributed to slowing sales in October, the same reason they gave for September's weak performance.


Candidates Lament Tone, But Attack Just the Same
They lamented the bitter tone of the campaign and insisted that they wanted to talk more about issues, but the two candidates for New York State comptroller fired off a steady stream of personal attacks tonight in the last of six televised debates.
H.
Carl McCall, the Democratic incumbent who three days ago appeared with supporters accusing the Republican, Herbert London, of engaging in racial attacks, was silent on that issue tonight.
But he opted instead to rip into his opponent for what he portrayed as Mr.
London's stand against abortion rights and gun control.


Newman's Early Steps On the Path to Maturity
Sometimes it seems that no decade of American art has been as thoroughly excavated as the 1940's, that famously halcyon time when Abstract Expressionism was on the rise and the tiny New York art world crackled with excitement.
Some of these excavations -- like the illuminating exhibition devoted to the Indian Space Painters held at Baruch College a few years ago -- add new information and broaden the sense of artistic participation.
Others rehearse the progress of the artists most frequently associated with the period, reinforcing the notion that this sea change was the work of a handful of geniuses.
"Barnett Newman: The Sublime Is Now," the beautiful exhibition of Newman's early work at the Pace Gallery, presents more than 50 drawings and small paintings dating from 1944 to 1949, and falls somewhere between the two types.
The show, organized in collaboration with the Walker Art Center and the St.
Louis Art Museum, follows one of the movement's giants as he clears the path to his mature style, those planes of flat, saturated color broken by hard-eged bands or feather-edged zips that we call Newmans.

Yes on the Nassau Charter
Of all the choices facing Nassau County voters next Tuesday, none bears more directly on their future than Proposal No. 1 -- a charter revision that would create a new 19-member legislature to replace the six-member Board of Supervisors, which has held sway in the county for almost 100 years.
A switch to a county legislature was made inevitable more than a year ago when a Federal judge declared the Board of Supervisors and its weighted voting system an unconstitutional violation of the principle of one person one vote.
If Proposal No. 1 fails, the court will impose its own, possibly more expensive plan -- throwing out not only the proposed 19-member legislature but also other reforms proposed by the bipartisan Charter Revision Commission.
These include an independent budget review office, a line-item veto for the County Executive and a stricter county ethics code.

A Jury Is Selected In the Simpson Case
After weeks of often tedious questioning, 12 jurors -- eight black, two Hispanic, one white and one identified as half white and half American Indian -- were selected for the O. J. Simpson murder trial.
Although lawyers repeatedly told prospects that race was not an issue in the case, it was clearly a compelling concern during jury selection.

A Brain on Ice, a Dead Toad and Voila!
DESPITE the chivalry of its title, "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" will not strike anyone as chiefly Mary Shelley's invention.
Its principal architect is Kenneth Branagh, who does not hide his light under bushels, not even bushels of classic literary stature.
In a dazzling display of hubris, Mr.
Branagh takes on the godlike, idealistic young scientist's role while also directing this "Frankenstein" as an overheated romantic fable.
For a film of such lavishness and chaotic sprawl, creating-a-monster quips are obvious but inevitable.
"Frankenstein" is a cogent reminder that Mr.
Branagh's reputation as a film maker rests primarily on seductive popularizations of Shakespeare ("Henry V" and especially the star-studded, visually glamorous "Much Ado About Nothing").
An extravagant entertainer, Mr.
Branagh has a flair for capturing the mass appeal of familiar texts, so "Frankenstein" sounds reasonably well suited to his talents.
But this material is easily caricatured and dauntingly overexposed.
The monstrousness of "Frankenstein" extends to nearly 30 other films, not to mention a permanent place in the pantheon of Halloween masks and pop-cultural archetypes.

Immigration Issue Flares Anew in Senate Race
The California Senate race, already in turmoil over the issue of illegal immigration, was thrown into even greater confusion today by a case of mistaken identity.
A report by a San Francisco newspaper said that Government records indicated that Senator Dianne Feinstein, locked in a neck-and-neck re-election race with Representative Michael Huffington, apparently employed a Guatemalan housekeeper in the early 1980's who was in the United States illegally.


Redistricting Heats Up Election Races; 2 Margins of Error
To the Editor:
In this final week of the 1994 election campaign I would beg the media to stop using two misleading phrases when presenting poll results.
(1) Do not talk about "a statistical dead heat" if the gap between the candidates is 2 percent or more.
The phrase implies that a two- or three-point lead is the same as no lead.
Not true.
If a well-conducted poll shows one candidate two points ahead, the probability (not the certainty) is that he or she is ahead.

14 Latin Artists Exist Separately In a Bronx Show With Light Touches
"Cartographies" at the Bronx Museum of the Arts is a frustrating exhibition with decent ingredients but no center.
The show, organized by the Winnipeg Art Gallery in Manitoba, brings together 14 Latin American artists, several of whom have shown in New York.
They are an eclectic bunch, often thought-provoking, in one case genuinely exciting.
But neither the specific works nor the essays in the show's vague, buzzword-filled catalogue suggests why they were deemed suitable company.
Given the lack of a unifying theme, one is left to judge the artists one by one, and generally speaking, the lighter their touch the better they look.
It's refreshing to encounter a political metaphor as understated as Maria Fernanda Cardoso's "Flag," a checkerboard pattern of guava candies forming an emblem both sweet and insubstantial, or to find gender issues as deftly explored as they are in the work of Jose Leonilson, whose crudely sewn dresses and wall hangings stitched with provocative inscriptions are "women's work" quietly in revolt.


Diner's Journal
What's Sauce for the Guests. . . .
Why leave all the great New York experiences to the tourists?
That's what I thought as I sat by the window at the Sea Grill, watching a little girl with golden curls attempt a figure eight in the middle of the Rockefeller Center ice-skating rink.
The Sea Grill is one of those restaurants that New Yorkers tend to visit only when they have out-of-town guests in tow.
That's a shame.
The service is extremely solicitous: "Would you like some more of the lovely cheese toast?" our waiter kept asking. (Yes, we would.) The busboy replenished the water in the glasses each time we took a sip.
The seats are commodious and comfortable.
The sound level is civilized.
And the menu, as retooled by the new executive chef, Edward Brown, is impressive.

Bosnian Army and Croats Drive Serbs Out of a Town
In their most significant military success since the war here began, Bosnian Army and Croatian military units captured the town of Kupres today, driving out the Bosnian Serb forces who overran it in April 1992 with the help of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army, local news reports said.
Croatia's official news agency reported tonight that units of the Bosnian Croat militia, the Croatian Defense Council, had advanced northeastward into Kupres along a main highway, overrunning Serbian defensive positions and reaping significant quantities of abandoned Serbian weapons and ammunition.


Art in Review
Luc Tuymans
David Zwirner Gallery  43 Greene Street (near Broome Street)  SoHo  Through Dec. 3
Appealing as they sometimes are, Luc Tuymans's small, beautifully made paintings leave a lot to be desired.
One problem is the air of Conceptual reticence and rather pretentious humility that hangs over these greenish, grisaille works, which, invariably, seem based on appropriated photographs whose sources or whose import never quite come into focus.
Far more tenderly and sincerely painted than the works of Gerhard Richter, they still have some of Richter's chilly you-figure-it-out nonchalance, although the discrepancy between a "felt" surface and a more distanced image may be one of Mr.
Tuymans's goals.


BRISTOL-MYERS TO BUY CALGON VESTAL FOR $261.5 MILLION
The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company agreed yesterday to buy Calgon Vestal Laboratories, which makes skin care and infection control products, from Merck &amp; Company for $261.5 million.
The deal is valued at about two and half times Calgon Vestal's 1993 sales of $105 million, spokesmen for the two companies said.
Bristol-Myers Squibb said Calgon, which is based in St.
Louis, would be combined with its Convatec unit, based in Skillman, N.J.
The announcement followed the sale in June 1993 of Calgon Water Management to English China Clays P.L.C. of Britain for $307.5 million.

Redistricting Heats Up Election Races
To the Editor:
The competitiveness of next week's Congressional elections reflects, in part, the results of the 1991-92 redistricting, as is well known.
Unsurprisingly but importantly, how much competition each state experiences reflects whether, when the redistricting statutes were passed, that state was a one-party monopoly or had divided government.


2 Shops Resign Footwear Accounts
Two New York agencies said yesterday that they had resigned the accounts of two marketers of casual footwear and apparel.
Ammirati &amp; Puris/Lintas resigned the Boks casual footwear and apparel division of Reebok International Ltd. because, the agency said, it wants to concentrate on "core accounts" like Burger King.
Billings on the Boks account were estimated at $1 million, although when a predecessor agency, Ammirati &amp; Puris, was awarded the account in March 1993, billings were estimated at $9 million.


Legal Vacuum in Haiti Is Testing U.S. Policy
Two weeks after 20,000 American troops arrived here, soldiers raided a warehouse looking for a suspected arms cache and took the Haitian owner of the business, Gerry Mourra, prisoner.
That was on Oct. 2.
Patrick Woolley, Mr.

Even now, a month after his arrest, Mr.

The City Council voted yesterday to punish one of its members who defied Speaker Peter F. Vallone by voting against the $31.6 billion budget that the Council negotiated with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani four months ago.
At Mr.
Vallone's request, the Council voted overwhelmingly to remove Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge of Manhattan as chairwoman of the Council's Contracts Committee and to strip her of the $5,500 stipend that goes with the position.


MCA's Impatience With Wary Parent
The top two executives of MCA Inc. arrived in Japan with a bold proposal to invest in an American television broadcast network.
They left feeling, to use the words of one of them, as if they had been "treated as children" by their corporate parent, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company.
And the bad feelings persist nearly two months later.
MCA's 81-year-old chairman and chief executive, Lew R. Wasserman, and 59-year-old president and chief operating officer, Sidney J. Sheinberg, had made the 14-hour flight to Osaka on Sept. 17 for the meeting.
They were appalled by the welcome they received the next morning.
Matsushita's president, Yoichi Morishita, appeared two hours late -- and only after lower-level Matsushita executives had made clear that they would not consider the proposal.


What Rebound, Stupid?
Despite steady growth and low inflation, polls show that voters, especially the middle class, are unhappy and may not reward the Democrats.
Have they forgotten economic growth?
No, but higher interest rates have spoiled the benefits of growth for many Americans.
Contrary to the prevailing consensus, the growth record in this period of expansion is poor.
Total real growth in the first three years after recessions in 1970, 1974 and 1982 averaged nearly 16 percent.
But from 1991-94, total growth will barely reach 10 percent.
Expansions have been rewarded at the polls in years of high growth: 5.3 percent in 1964, 5.4 percent in 1972, 7.8 percent in 1984.
No such good year has occurred this time.


A Papal Best Seller -- and One That Wasn't
Mark Twain discovered the hard way that the Pope doesn't sell in America.
With his usual blindness in business matters, Twain decided in the late 1880's that a memoir of Leo XIII, the current Pope, would be a natural best seller.
There were 20 million Catholic Americans; how could they not buy a book that the Pope implied -- and his supernumeraries proclaimed -- was required reading for every Catholic?
Twain was feeling cocky.

John Colman Whitwell, who in 42 years at Princeton University became an expert in applying statistical methods to chemical engineering problems, died Oct. 28 at Applewood, a retirement and nursing home in Freehold, N.J.

A Warning Sign Surfaces Between Reeves and Young
His brutal honesty is what makes everyone around Dan Reeves respect and admire him.
Honesty is a priceless commodity but sometimes it can be painful to endure.
Now Reeves's trademark has put the Giants in this predicament: For the first time, someone in the Giants' organization has publicly criticized the job General Manager George Young has done with free agency.
And, for the first time, there are signs of a certain amount of incompatibility between Reeves and Young that many in professional football thought would eventually surface.


Restaurants
Most restaurants stumble through their opening days like people who have been forced out of bed too early in the morning: grumpy and uncoordinated, they act as if they wish you would just go away.
Monkey Bar was different.
The restaurant landed on East 54th Street so smoothly that in its first week it already felt as if it had been there forever.
The patrons that filled both the raucous bar and the sedate dining room also had a possessive air, as if they had always been there.
They seemed to have moved in en masse overnight, and it was impossible not to speculate that a nearby restaurant was sitting empty, wondering where all its customers had gone.


Abroad at Home; Change Of Character
If you liked the 1992 Republican National Convention, with its bashing of the un-Christian and the un-straight, you'll love the 1996 convention.

Last time we had Pat Robertson and Pat Buchanan.
We had the Republican Chairman, Rich Bond, warning that if Bill Clinton was elected, Jane Fonda would be sleeping in the White House "as guest of honor at a state dinner for Fidel Castro."


Police Say Woman Admits to Killings as Bodies of 2 Children Are Found Inside Her Car
In a turn of events that some people in her town expected but few wanted to believe, a South Carolina woman who reported that her two little boys had been abducted by a carjacker was arrested and charged today with two counts of murder in their deaths.
According to the arrest warrant, 23-year-old Susan V. Smith confessed to the murders of her sons -- 3-year-old Michael Smith and his 14-month-old brother, Alexander.


Branagh Brings Cagney to the Streets of Belfast
When Tommy Black (Paul Ronan), an unemployed young man from a Protestant neighborhood in Belfast, opens his mouth, what often comes out is dialogue lifted intact from the James Cagney movies he spends his spare time studying on home video.
Tommy, who lives with his widowed mother (Patti Allison) and dour brother (Neal Jones) in a working-class neighborhood, is the highly symbolic main character in Kenneth Branagh's socially pointed melodrama "Public Enemy," which is having its American premiere at the Irish Arts Center.
The play, which predates the films directed by Mr.
Branagh, takes place in the mid-1980's, when the strife in Belfast was worse than it is today.
One way Tommy has avoided being caught up in the warfare that divides the city is by spinning a fantasy of himself as a latter-day Cagney character.
In the play's opening scene, he wins a talent contest in a bar by doing an impersonation of the Hollywood legend singing and dancing "Yankee Doodle Dandy." But it quickly becomes clear that Tommy's identification with Cagney is more than a crowd-pleasing daydream.
It is an obsession that has spun dangerously out of control.

But Albany airport was going to be closed to commercial air traffic for much of the morning to accommodate Mr.
Clinton's arrival.
So Mr.
Pataki, his wife, Libby, and several aides packed into the campaign's Chevrolet Suburban Wednesday night and made the roughly two-hour drive from his Putnam County home.

Rem Koolhaas's New York State of Mind
NEW YORK CITY'S most inspiring architect lives in London, works in Rotterdam and has yet to build a thing on the North American continent.
But for the next three months, Rem Koolhaas has the stage at the Museum of Modern Art, where New Yorkers can see for themselves how their city continues to shape the world even as their own architecture has slipped below world-class standards.
Considering all the fanfare this show has generated, including lavish spreads in the fashion glossies, "O.M.A. at MOMA: Rem Koolhaas and the Place of Public Architecture" turns out to be relatively modest in scale.
Confined to one top-floor gallery in the Modern's department of architecture and design, the show presents models and drawings for five projects designed in the last five years by Mr.
Koolhaas and his Office for Metropolitan Architecture (O.M.A.).
Three additional models, depicting urban plans, are displayed on the landing outside. (Models for three private houses are on view in the museum's Education Center on the ground floor.)

Despite growing unemployment in Russia and the widespread practice of companies not paying their workers for long periods, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia has called for a "more rigorous policy of economic reform to insure stability" (news article, Oct. 28).
What this means is that impoverished working people and pensioners will be expected to tighten their belts even further.

Critic's Choice/Film; Still Scary, Now in Mint Condition
Sometimes a cigar isn't just a cigar: for instance, when Stanley Kubrick's camera gazes up at the face of Gen.
Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), the militaristic madman obsessed with "precious bodily fluids" and casually responsible for having triggered Armageddon in "Dr. Strangelove." The cigar-chomping general offers a hilarious if unsubtle image of masculine paranoia, which took on epic proportions in Mr.
Kubrick's scathing doomsday comedy.
In a post-cold war climate, "Dr. Strangelove" remains a supremely scary classic.
Thirty years have done little to date its rogues' gallery of guided missiles and misguided commanders, all of them conspiring to destroy the world in the most businesslike possible fashion.
Kubrick's chilliness remains every bit as disturbing as the threat of nuclear war, but it also inspires awe.
So does the fact that with a fastidiousness some of his own characters might have appreciated, Mr.
Kubrick has rephotographed every frame of this film with a Nikon camera to create a mint-condition print for its 30th anniversary.


Greyhound Will Resist Bankruptcy Action
Greyhound Lines Inc. said today that it would "vigorously oppose and resist" a move by dissident bondholders to try to force the struggling company into bankruptcy protection.
A small group of bondholders, who say they hold at least 25 percent of Greyhound's convertible subordinated debt, filed a petition for involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy late Wednesday night in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, where Greyhound is based.
The filing came a day after bondholders rejected the company's latest proposal to restructure its debt.

Prices of Treasury securities were reasonably steady yesterday, although the yield on the long bond edged up to a two-and-a-half-year high.
Investors remain concerned that inflation could accelerate, causing them to lose value on fixed-income investments.
Yesterday's report showing new- home sales in September were the highest in six months, even as mortgage rates climbed to two-year highs, added to their concerns.

Leslie Fay's Lawyers Deny Wrongdoing
The law firm of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges vigorously denied allegations yesterday of impropriety in its representation of the Leslie Fay Companies in the apparel maker's bankruptcy-law proceedings.
At the same time, the firm urged the Federal bankruptcy judge, Tina L. Brozman, to deny a motion that it be disqualified as the company's counsel and be forced to forfeit part of the $5.3 million in fees it has billed.
In a written response to a motion filed last month by the Federal bankruptcy trustee, Arthur J. Gonzalez, the firm said the charges were "premised on mere speculation."


Nazi Executioner and Jew Reunited
Genghis Cohn is a comic ventriloquist in Germany in the 1930's.
He asks his audience, "How do you kill a Jewish comedian?" Answer: "Same as any comedian. You don't laugh at his jokes." Not quite.
Cohn, whose act has died in many a seedy club, finally dies himself at Dachau.
Jump to 1958 and a picturesque village in Bavaria with a new civic center offering special programs of American musical films.
The police chief, proud of the lowest crime rate in Bavaria, is Otto Schatz, who is not eager to recall his war years in Hitler's SS.
As it happens, Schatz was Cohn's executioner.
Suddenly the police chief is confronted with a series of local murders, the male victims invariably having died with a smile on their faces immediately after sexual intercourse.
Schatz is nonplused.
Then, when the ghost of Cohn visits him to offer sardonic assistance, he goes positively, as Cohn would have it, meshuga.


Run-In Will Cost Jet $10,000
The National Football League fined Donald Evans, a Jets defensive tackle, $10,000 today for a run-in with the referee Bernie Kukar during Sunday's game against the Indianapolis Colts.
First offenses for abusing a referee usually draw a maximum fine of $5,000, but Greg Aiello, the N.F.L.'s director of information, said of Evans, "He verbally abused the referee and shoved him away and then continued and charged the referee and further abused him verbally."

It was 9:30 A.M. and Elizabeth P. McCaughey, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, had already downed a hamburger and two bagels and given the family chihuahua a bath.
This was, after all, a big day.
The woman billed as her ticket's policy expert said she is usually buried in documents.
"Do you ever look at this one?" she said at one point, holding up the Annual Statistical Report from 1992 of the New York State Department of Social Services.
"It's a gold mine."

Texas' as a Mini-Series
A mini-series -- "Lonesome Dove," say -- normally begins on television and later turns up on videocassette.
On Wednesday, though, a mini-series called "Texas," based on the novel by James A. Michener, will get its start not on a network but in video stores.
Only after at least 90 days as a rental title will it be shown on ABC, home video's partner in the enterprise.


Jury Recommends Death Penalty for Abortion Foe Convicted in 2 Killings in Florida
A jury recommended today that Paul J. Hill die in Florida's electric chair for killing an abortion clinic doctor and an escort.
The verdict came just a few hours after the defendant, in his first words to the panel, said, "You may mix my blood with the blood of the unborn and those who have fought to defend the oppressed."
The six men and six women on the jury took four hours to decide whether the crimes warranted the death penalty or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
They convicted Mr.
Hill of the murders on Wednesday after only 20 minutes of deliberation.


Family Values and Love In Vietnam Aftermath
Set in a small Mississippi town and centered on a children's battle over a tree house, "The War" is an allegory about love, death, pacifism, family values and the spiritual and physical wounds of Vietnam.
To no small degree it is also about movie stars, who have the power to transform platitudes into warm, affecting insights when they make their presence sufficiently persuasive on screen.
"The War" has the benefit of two such presences: Kevin Costner, who is at his most disarming in the role of Stephen Simmons, a Vietnam veteran having trouble returning to his wife and children (the year is 1970), and Elijah Wood, who plays his son.
Mr.
Costner's folksy sincerity is enough to lure the Spanish moss right off the live oaks, and he works hard in the potato fields the way only a major movie star can.
He's effortlessly appealing, and Mr.
Wood holds up his end of the story with equal assurance.

Two Bruised Jets Tailbacks Try to Heal for Bills
Johnny Johnson is feeling better.
So is Anthony Johnson.
But the Jets' battered tailbacks again sat out practice today and remained questionable for Sunday's game against the Buffalo Bills at Giants Stadium.
On the sidelines, Johnny Johnson, normally the starter, strode 100 yards at a time, and his strained right hamstring held up.
He said he would try to play Sunday.
Anthony Johnson, recovering from a slight separation of the left shoulder, said the same.
Adrian Murrell, the other tailback, will miss the game because of a sprained knee.

Jazz Opens N.B.A. Season Without Wright
A day before its season opener, the Utah Jazz yesterday waived LUTHER WRIGHT, the 23-year-old center whose National Basketball Association promise has never been realized.
The 7-foot-2-inch Wright, who starred in high school in Elizabeth, N.J., and who had a solid college career in his three years at Seton Hall under Coach P. J. CARLESIMO, was a first-round draft choice (18th over all) by the Jazz in 1993.
He has had health problems and trouble keeping his weight under 300 pounds since entering the N.B.A.


A Jury Is Chosen to Hear The Simpson Murder Case
Nearly five months after he was charged with murdering his former wife and her friend, O. J. Simpson finally came face to face today with the 12 men and women who will judge him.
The selection of the jury was completed with a burst of speed late in the afternoon on what was to have been only the first of a number of days of peremptory challenges, in which lawyers for the opposing sides may exclude prospective jurors without stating a reason.


Lawyers Defend Billing System That Got Colleague in Trouble
After a Federal jury convicted a lawyer on mail-fraud charges connected to billing practices that are common throughout the profession, the legal community trembled.
So when a Federal appeals court reversed the conviction earlier this week, lawyers sighed with relief, then sought to explain how a generalized bill on a fake letterhead could be in a client's best interests.
The lawyer in question, Armand P. D'Amato of Long Island had been retained in the mid-1980's by the Unisys Corporation, a military contractor, to lobby his brother, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, and others.
At Unisys's request, the lawyer submitted bills over two years totaling $120,000 that were vague and on stationery with a letterhead naming one of his partners, but not himself.


Crash Inquiry Focuses on Ice And Steering
The American Eagle airliner that crashed here on Monday, killing all 68 people aboard, took just 36 seconds to fall out of the sky from more than a mile and a quarter above the ground, first tipping 77 degrees to the right, recovering to 59 degrees, then flipping upside down and plunging at a 45-degree angle, a Federal safety official said tonight.
With the cause of the rollover still not clear, James E. Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, also announced that American Eagle had ordered its pilots flying the kind of plane that crashed, a twin-engine turboprop, to stop using the autopilot in weather conditions like those on Monday afternoon, when ice can build up on the wings.


Hasidic Students Describe Brooklyn Bridge Nightmare
Testifying in a Manhattan courtroom yesterday, three passengers described in harrowing detail the terror, chaos and shock when a van carrying 15 Hasidic students across the Brooklyn Bridge came under gunfire in March.
The students were returning to Brooklyn from a Manhattan hospital where their religious leader, the late Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Schneerson, had just undergone successful eye surgery.
But in what the prosecution says was a sudden and unprovoked burst of gunfire, their joy and relief turned into a nightmare, as the windows in the van were shattered and a rain of bullets smashed through it, killing one student and wounding three others.

For the last six years Jane Hammond has made paintings using a repertory of 276 appropriated images and six predetermined colors, with mostly deadly results, but her recent paintings are starting to shed their visual stiffness.
Her compositions are looser and more casually layered, her surfaces brushier, her palette less emphatically limited.
Her images, often used more sparsely or on canvases shaped (a little like Elizabeth Murray's) to suggest hands, feet or open books, interact more suggestively.


Clinton Campaigns Upstate With an Eye on the Nation
President Clinton, making his fourth campaign trip for Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo and his first to upstate New York, cast Tuesday's gubernatorial election and similar races around the country as contests between forward-looking Democrats and negativist Republicans who, he said, want Americans to "vote your anger."
"Yes, there is frustration in the electorate," Mr.
Clinton acknowledged at a clamorous, partisan rally on the Albany campus of the State University of New York.
"But you know, the first thing you try to teach your children as a parent, once they really begin to be aware of the world, is not to make an important decision when you're mad.


Spare the Rod When Treating Troubled Youth
To the Editor:
It is troubling that you would devote so little space to the youth sentenced to eight years in the California Youth Authority for defacing property with graffiti (news article, Nov. 1).
Michael Faye, the young American sentenced to caning in Singapore, received front-page coverage day after day, and Singapore was admonished for its inhumane punishments.
While I share in the disdain for Singapore's methods, Michael Faye is free today, while the California boy has eight more years of incarceration.
Where is the front-page article on that, and why are we so afraid to examine and criticize our own methods?


Corrections
An article yesterday about Rwanda misstated the United Nations' estimate of the number of people displaced by violence there.
It is 1.8 million, not 11.8 million.


Spare the Rod When Treating Troubled Youth; Prisons Don't Work
To the Editor:
Washington and the state governments are falling all over each other to approve billions of additional dollars for more prisons and police, even though 74 percent of all prison space in the United States was built in the last 10 years.
The march toward more prisons and longer sentences is truly bizarre in the face of its clear lack of effectiveness.


Young &amp; Rubicam Gets Teflon Account
E.
I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company has selected Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. in New York to handle its Teflon finishes business in North America and Mexico, with billings estimated at $7 million.
For more than 20 years, N. W. Ayer &amp; Partners in New York handled the account, which includes the Silverstone and Silverstone Xtra brands of nonstick cookware, in North America.
Y.&amp; R., which already handles Du Pont brands like Lycra, was awarded the Teflon account Wednesday after a two-month review that also included Ayer and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi/Rumrill Hoyt in Rochester.


Rural Social Commentary With a Difference
The images that Doris Ulmann made in the South in the 1920's and 30's occupy a curious position in the history of documentary photography.
Ulmann's subjects, among them the mountain people of Appalachia and the blacks of the Gullah region of South Carolina, were staples of socially concerned photography during the New Deal era, whether Margaret Bourke-White's sensationalist reportage for Life magazine or the more measured documentary work of Walker Evans and other photographers working for the Farm Security Administration.
But Ulmann's soft-focus portraits, presented in richly expressive prints made using the platinum process, are distinctly unlike the sharp, detailed images favored by her contemporaries.
A diverse selection of Ulmann's powerful but rarely seen images, at the 292 Gallery in SoHo, is a pleasure to see for its own sake, and also valuable as a challenge to the widespread notion that only the sharp-focus approach of Modernism is appropriate for social analysis and critique.


U.N. Envoy Pessimistic About Holding Orderly Election in Haiti
A United Nations envoy to Haiti reported today that the security and the political stability of the country were still shaky and might remain that way for some time.
While civil unrest has declined markedly since United States troops landed two months ago, police and paramilitary forces might be inadequate to oversee elections, said the envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi.
Elections for 2,000 local officials, 9 of the 27 Senators and all 83 Deputies are to take place by late January but no date has been set.

THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo; Close Races Are Turning More Jittery
How would you expect a jittery campaign year to end?
With a bad case of the jitters, of course.
It isn't only that candidates seem to be jumping out of their skins.
Gov.

John Marty, the Democratic challenger for the statehouse in Minnesota, still searching for the right message, is on his fourth campaign manager.

Sally A. Knapp; Singer and Actress, 68
Sally A. Knapp, a singer and actress who appeared in numerous productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, died on Tuesday at Gwinett County Hospital in Georgia.
She was 68 and lived in Atlanta.
The cause was an aneurism, said Tedi Dreiser Godard, a friend.
Miss Knapp was a leading actress with Dorothy Raedler's Masque and Lyre Light Opera Company, which later became the American Savoyards.
She starred in many of its productions, as well as in television commercials.


Accord Reached on L.I. To Save Pine Barrens
New York State has reached agreements on the first land purchases in the Long Island pine barrens under a 1993 law intended to preserve a 50,000-acre core area and regulate development in the surrounding 50,000 acres.
Under an agreement negotiated for the state by the Long Island chapter of the Nature Conservancy, the state will pay $1.4 million for 141 acres in Westhampton.
The owner, a developer, was seeking final approval to build a clustered housing development on the property.


U.N. Assembly Approves Call for End to Bosnian Arms Embargo
The General Assembly adopted a resolution today urging the Security Council to lift an arms embargo on the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The resolution, which passed by a vote of 97 to 0, with 61 abstentions, also asks member states of the United Nations to help Bosnia exercise its "inherent right of individual and collective self-defense." Because of misgivings that lifting the embargo could itensify the war, the resolution did not get as much support as its backers hoped.


U.S. Is Shifting Trade Emphasis Away from Japan; More Growth Predicted for New Markets
Suffering battle fatigue after two years of fighting Japan over trade issues, the Clinton Administration is putting a new emphasis on the emerging markets in the rest of Asia and Latin America -- areas that it believes will greatly outstrip Japan as consumers of American exports.
The change in emphasis will become evident over the next month, as Mr.
Clinton flies off to two trade meetings, first with Asian leaders in Jakarta, Indonesia, and then with Latin American leaders in Miami.
Already, Mr.
Clinton's top economic aides are brandishing charts and graphs to prove their point that growth in American exports to those regions will dwarf exports to Japan over the next 15 years.
This should be the case even if every trade barrier the United States has complained about in Japan is dismantled.

U.S. Is Shifting Trade Emphasis Away From Japan; A Focus on Rest of Asia, Latin Nations
When Edgar S. Woolard Jr., chairman and chief executive of E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, delivered a speech by satellite to the company's Asian offices recently, not once did he mention Japan, which accounts for half of the chemical giant's Asian sales.
Mr.
Woolard instead gushed on about new opportunities in China and elsewhere in the Far East, to the annoyance of company employees in Japan.
More and more, American companies seem to be less mindful of Japan, lured instead by faster-growing, less-developed markets in China and elsewhere in Asia.
Japan is perceived as an already mature market in which it is expensive to operate, with strong domestic competitors and numerous regulations and other barriers.


Perot to Back Lautenberg Over Republican Candidate
Ross Perot will endorse Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, the Democrat seeking re-election, and will campaign with him this weekend, advisers to both men said early today.
A Perot endorsement could give the incumbent a boost with an independent bloc of voters that he and his Republican challenger, Chuck Haytaian, have avidly courted.
David Eichenbaum, Mr.
Lautenberg's campaign manager, said that Mr.
Perot would endorse the Senator and join him on the stump, though specific arrangements had not yet been made.
A senior official in the New Jersey branch of United We Stand, America, the organization founded by Mr.
Perot, confirmed that there would be an endorsement of Mr.
Lautenberg.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that "only the time and place have to be confirmed."


A Papal Best Seller -- and One That Wasn't
Last month Alfred A. Knopf published Pope John Paul II's "Crossing the Threshold of Hope," a question-and-answer book for which it paid nearly $9 million and which soon showed up on the best-seller list.
The huge sum has made the book's commercial fate the latest measure of the Pope's popularity, and that of his papacy -- a state of affairs that sends disquieting signals about the Roman Catholic Church today.
Even as polls of American Catholics show deep dissent from his positions -- a 1992 poll, for example, showed that 67 percent favor opening the priesthood to women -- John Paul II remains hugely popular.
Why?
Various explanations have been offered.
He is charismatic, and a master of the world tour and the vast open-air Mass.
In a culture of mendacious politicians and instant celebrities, he is appealingly countercultural: this world leader is no floating waffle.
And many people believe his worldview is the true one.


Natural Virus Said to Check Brown Tide
A discovery by scientists may help Long Island fishermen who have been plagued for nearly a decade by brown tide, a mysterious, troublesome algae growth that turns sea water the color of coffee and chokes the life out of waterways where shellfish once thrived.
The scientists report that they have isolated a number of viruses that live in the sea water and can destroy the microscopic brown tide algae.
While the results are preliminary, the scientists say the discovery may lead to the use of the viruses to help prevent the spread of brown tide.

As always with Ms.

PATAKI REVISITS BASE OF SUPPORT IN UPSTATE CITIES
Returning to his base of support with his paramount campaign message, State Senator George E. Pataki, the Republican candidate for governor, swept through four upstate cities today with an entourage of Republican candidates and county executives who reaffirmed his call for deep tax cuts and reduced state spending.
"Mario Cuomo's politics, the politics of higher taxes and fewer jobs, is the politics of the past," Mr.
Pataki said on the sunwashed steps of the State Capitol this morning, seeking to present a vision of hope even as he slashed at Governor Cuomo.
"Our politics, our politics of lower taxes and more jobs, is the politics of the future."

A Lyrical Search for Joy in Russia at Its Bleakest
The sloped, snowy, trap-door-riddled stage now in the Opera House of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where the extraordinary Maly Drama Theater of St.
Petersburg has arrived, is a magical and dangerous thing.
It can devour men whole and regurgitate them in unrecognizable forms.
Beneath it, we are told, lurks an infinitude of human feces; yet it also coughs up a wonder-inspiring host of multi-color balloons.
In "Gaudeamus," a singular combination of scatological satire and exquisite lyricism with which the legendary Russian company is now touring the United States, the director Lev Dodin and his set designer, Aleksei Porai-Koshits, have created a mesmerizing portrait of a corrupt, rotting world redeemed, however fleetingly, by fantasy.

TENNIS  Navratilova Fights Back  Martina Navratilova, overcoming careless errors and the power of Amy Frazier, rallied for a 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory last night to reach the semifinals of the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland, Calif.
Navratilova, the No. 2 seed playing in her next-to-last tournament, made repeated mistakes in the first set and was within two games of losing the match at 4-4 in the second.
At one point, she turned to Coach Craig Kardon and spread her arms, palms upward, as if to say, "What can I do?" But she suddenly turned those errors into winning shots and Frazier fell apart, losing eight of the last nine games, including her last four service games.

Zap! Futuristic Fighter Show Is Alien to Canada's Culture
Alien-battling guardians of the planet have just taken a body blow from a national broadcasters' regulatory body that ruled that "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," the popular Los Angeles-produced children's show viewed in more than 30 countries, is too violent for Canadian television.
As a result of the decision by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council, YTV, a youth cable channel, has canceled the series and Global Television, a commercial television network, says it's talking with the producer about ways to make the show conform to Canadian criteria.

These Marathon Men Are Keeping It Safe
The New York City Marathon is a small business.
So small that its big decisions have been made from a rear table at the Brasserie restaurant on East 53d Street by Fred Lebow, the soul of the race, who died of brain cancer on Oct. 9; Charles McCabe, a banker; Jack Rudin, a real-estate magnate, and Allan Steinfeld, Lebow's former assistant and now his successor.
The "Good Taste Committee," a kind of informal board of directors, has ruled since 1976 on the propriety of potential sponsors, and labored to cut red tape with city agencies in order to ease the marathon's five-borough path.

Twenty-two of the 30 men and women who have won the New York City Marathon had lunch at Chemical Bank's headquarters yesterday, and two more are expected for ceremonial events today.
But the goal of having 25 at the 25th marathon on Sunday seems beyond reach, partly because two winners of early women's races could not get time off from work, and partly because Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya, the 1987 winner, seems to have dropped off the face of the earth, or at least the world of running.

On the Trail
Developments yesterday in campaigns across the country.
VIRGINIA -- Two new polls show that the race for Senate in Virginia is still unsettled in the final days and Senator Charles S. Robb may be gaining ground.
Both suggest that the Democratic incumbent has overtaken his Republican challenger, Oliver L. North, but the leads are within the statistical margin of sampling error.
The surveys were conducted by the Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research company and the Virginia Commonwealth University.
Scott Keeter, a director of the Virginia Commonwealth poll, said that the most notable difference in the last two polls was a decline in the percentage of voters who said they trust Mr.
North to tell the truth -- from 37 percent last month to 26 percent this time.
One explanation, Dr.
Keeter said, could be Nancy Reagan's comment last week that Mr.
North "lied to my husband and lied about him." MICHIGAN -- Detroit's largest black-owned newspaper, The Michigan Chronicle, has sent shock waves through state political circles by endorsing Gov.
John Engler, a conservative Republican, for re-election on its front page.
While polls have shown Mr.
Engler far ahead of his challenger, former Representative Howard Wolpe, the Governor has been even less popular than most Republicans among black voters.
Indeed, he received only 13 percent of the vote in Detroit in 1990.
The Chronicle, which has historically endorsed Democratic candidates, described Governor Engler as having shown a lack of "compassion" toward blacks, but said Mr.
Wolpe had failed to describe how he would improve Michigan's economy.
The editorial said black Americans want "our civil rights recognized, but we also want to see a better return on our tax dollars."


Gazans Eject P.L.O. Leader From Funeral
Gazans poured into the streets today for the funeral of an Islamic militant leader killed in a car bombing on Wednesday, accusing Israel of assassinating him but also venting their rage against Yasir Arafat.
They denounced the leader of the new Palestinian Authority as a collaborator with the Israelis and shoved him out of a mosque as he tried to join the religious service.
According to some reports, Mr.
Arafat was treated so roughly by angry Muslims at the Omari Mosque in Gaza City that they knocked off his trademark head scarf.
"This is your peace, Arafat!" people shouted at him.
"It's all liquidations and assassinations!"

The music would slow and a space would be opened for her to seize a phrase and take it to church with sassy shouts and gospel melismas, as a rumbling piano and backup vocals buoyed her shivering cries.
At such rare moments, the gospel roots of the queen of soul took the musical reins.
Ms.
Franklin's concerts are notoriously uneven, but on Thursday she was in fine voice and in high spirits.
Early in the show, which was presented by the Hard Rock Cafe of New York, with the proceeds benefiting several of Ms.
Franklin's favorite charities, she joked of having given up smoking and of controlling her weight through a combination of "Slim Fast and young men."

Jobs Figuring Large in Diplomacy
In a pre-election bid to show that its strategy of commercial diplomacy is paying off for American workers, the Clinton Administration announced today that the McDonnell Douglas Corporation would manufacture 20 commercial aircraft for China at its plant in Long Beach, Calif. -- rather than let the Chinese produce the aircraft themselves in Shanghai.
President Clinton made the formal announcement at a campaign stop in front of hundreds of McDonnell Douglas employees near the aircraft maker's plant this afternoon.
He appeared with California's two Democratic Senators, Dianne Feinstein, who is in a tight race for re-election, and Barbara Boxer.

As Beach Areas Become Populated, a Debate on Hunting Intensifies
Duck and goose hunting season has arrived in Connecticut and with it an increasingly heated debate over whether the state's shoreline has become too densely populated to allow hunters to shoot waterfowl on or near public beaches.
Many shoreline residents and year-round beachgoers say laws permitting duck and goose hunting along Long Island Sound are antiquated, established decades ago when the beaches became virtual ghost towns after Labor Day.

Pope Visits Sicily Amid Alarm Over the Mafia
On his first trip since poor health forced him to cancel a journey to the United States, Pope John Paul II tonight began a weekend visit to Sicily, where alarm is growing over threats to priests from the Mafia.
The 74-year-old Pope, who broke a thigh bone in a bathroom fall in April, emerged unaided from his plane here, without the cane he has often used since his fall.
But he seemed uncertain of his footing as he descended the few steps to the tarmac.
As is usually the case on papal trips inside Italy, he did not kneel to kiss the ground.

In Liberal 14th, Rivals Target the Right
In New York City's hottest Congressional race, the man to beat -- or beat up on -- is not Bill Clinton, whom Republicans across the country are running against and Democrats are running away from.
Here in the 14th District, it is Newt Gingrich, the Georgia conservative who will likely become Speaker of the House if his party gains control.
The old Silk Stocking district on Manhattan's East Side, redrawn two years ago to include heavily Democratic chunks of Queens and Brooklyn and a finger of the Upper West Side, has a liberal tradition that was only strengthened by the reshaping.
And Representative Carolyn B. Maloney regularly reminds voters there that her Republican opponent could help hand Mr.
Gingrich a promotion.

ARMS TRAFFICKING TO BOSNIA GOES ON DESPITE EMBARGO
Even as the United Nations discusses lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina, the embargo appears to have become largely a fiction, openly flouted.
Helped by the ready availability of arms and military components in the former Soviet bloc countries and by an apparent American readiness to turn a blind eye, Croatia is now building or assembling everything from battle tanks to MIG-21 fighter aircraft and acting as the main conduit for the flood of weapons reaching Bosnia.


Complaints To Review Unit About Police Increase 46%
The Civilian Complaint Review Board yesterday reported a 46 percent increase in complaints of police brutality and other abuses in the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 1993.
The board and the Police Department received 2,190 complaints through June, including reports of 220 beatings, 24 uses of flashlights as clubs, 15 pistol-whippings and 153 threats of force.
At the same time, reports of offensive language by the police, like ethnic or racial slurs, decreased 9 percent, to 255 incidents from 281, the board said.

The woman, Susan V. Smith, had waived her right to appear before a judge inside the vaulted, turn-of-the-century Union County courthouse to hear the charges read.
She waited instead inside the sheriff's office next door.
But as Mrs.
Smith was driven away, her head buried in her lap, she could not escape the jeers and epithets hurled at her by about 200 townspeople who had gathered to condemn her.

Judge in White House Attack Weighing Curbs on Remarks
Federal prosecutors argued today that there was no need for an order to restrict public comment in the case of a man accused of raking the White House with semiautomatic rifle fire a week ago.
The order is being sought by lawyers for the man, Francisco M. Duran.
They had asked a Federal magistrate-judge, Deborah A. Robinson, to stop Government officials from making any comment about the case to reporters.
Leigh A. Kenny, Mr.
Duran's lead lawyer, said in legal papers filed today that news accounts about the case could hamper her client's ability to get a fair trial.
She bolstered her argument with 250 pages of photocopied news accounts about the shooting.


In Their Own Words
ROSS PEROT  The former Presidential candidate released a letter endorsing Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, the incumbent Democrat, for re-election in New Jersey.
Here is an excerpt:
"You and I have known each other for a long time, back to the days when we were both working to build a fledgling industry. I know that politics has not been your career, and that you chose to serve in order to provide a better future for all of our people and to give something back to your state and country. You are one of the few members of the Senate who knows how the real world works and we need to keep you there working for us."  A HAYTAIAN SPOKESMAN
Larry Purpuro, a spokesman for Chuck Haytaian, the Republican candidate for Senate, offered this response to the Perot endorsement.
"Senator Lautenberg has called Mr. Perot an 'autocrat' who is 'unfit' for office and now he seeks the man's support. Mr. Lautenberg's solicitation of Perot's endorsement is consistent with the rest of his duplicitous election-year tactics."

On the Trail
Developments yesterday in campaigns across the country.
GEORGIA A funny thing has happened to Newt Gingrich on his way to becoming House Speaker, minority leader or whatever position of power he expects to hold after the election.
Amid indications that the race against his Democratic challenger, Ben Jones, is closer than he might have liked, Mr.
Gingrich, the House Republican whip, has canceled a planned trip to campaign for candidates in California tomorrow; he will instead concentrate on his own re-election campaign in Georgia's Sixth Congressional District.
Mr.
Gingrich says he is comfortably ahead in the largely Republican district, north of Atlanta.
But Mr.
Jones says Mr.
Gingrich's decision to spend more time at home is evidence that the challenger's low-budget campaign has caught on.


JOBLESS RATE FELL AGAIN IN OCTOBER TO A 4-YEAR LOW
The job market improved in October as the unemployment rate eased to 5.8 percent, another four-year low, and hourly wages rose by the largest amount in more than a decade, the Labor Department reported today.
Payroll gains were relatively modest, though, with the economy adding 194,000 jobs last month, well below the quarter of a million jobs added during a typical month this year.
California, which has lagged far behind the rest of the country, was particularly impressive, with unemployment dropping to 7.7 percent from 8.3 percent.
Employment in New York and New Jersey was virtually flat.


Cuomo Unveils An Infomercial

A Revival With Early Minimalism
In "Marimba," which the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company revived on Thursday night at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea), Mr.
Lubovitch seeks variety within unity.
Mr.
Lubovitch was one of the first choreographers to be attracted by the music of the composers who came to be known as Minimalists.
The recorded accompaniment for "Marimba," which dates from 1976, is Steve Reich's "Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ," an entrancingly crystalline piece but one that develops at its own unhurried pace.
Mr.
Lubovitch respects its formal structure yet is never enslaved by it.
The dancers are first seen in a huddle, from which they step forward in slow motion.
As they progress, they cling to one another at times, only to disentangle themselves.

LAUTENBERG ASSAILED ON FAMILIAR THEMES In his first race for the United States Senate 12 years ago, Frank R. Lautenberg raised the question of whether his 72-year-old opponent, Congresswoman Millicent Fenwick, was past her political prime, questioning "her ability to do the job." Six years later, he sought to convince voters that his rival, Pete Dawkins, was out of touch.
Now, as Mr.
Lautenberg seeks a third term, those issues are again a part of the race, only they have now been turned against the 70-year-old Democratic incumbent.

On Wednesday, two men in leather jackets strode into his Hunts Point office, told his secretary to lie on the floor and threw him on a couch.
Then, one put a gun to his left temple and shot him to death.

F.A.A. Warns Airlines on Autopilot Use in Ice
The Federal Aviation Administration today advised operators of 150 airplanes like the American Eagle plane that crashed near here on Monday to stop using the autopilot in icy conditions and to retract the flaps while in a holding pattern.
The agency issued those instructions as advice only, noting that the National Transportation Safety Board was still in the early stages of its investigation of the crash and that no cause had been established.
But the recommendation shows the agency is seriously considering the possibility that icing was a factor in the crash.
"We want to err on the side of safety," said Sondra Allen, an agency spokeswoman.
"These are procedures that make sense at this point in the investigation."


Job Report Jolts Bonds; Rates Rise
Solid gains in jobs and wages jolted the Treasury market yesterday, driving long-term interest rates to their highest level in more than three years.

Despite the recession in Japan, auto parts manufacturers there are improving their already superior quality and productivity faster than their competitors in North America, according to a study of 71 component plants in nine countries.

As a result, the survey's results imply that domestic manufacturers may not be competitive when the market turns down.

Musicians Take On the Challenge of Old Age
The trumpeter Jonah Jones didn't show up for the Highlights in Jazz concert at Pace University on Thursday night, so the trombonist Al Grey, who was there to listen, took his place.
Mr.
Grey, playing a borrowed bass trombone (he usually plays a tenor trombone) and, using a clear plastic cup as his plunger, put together a solo on "C-Jam Blues" that was a miracle of blues ideas, bent and throttled notes and vocalizations.
It was as if he had sung his solo.
In its casualness and its willingness to lead the audience through its adventure, the music seemed communal, the audience and performers like old friends.
The concert was meant to feature some of the older musicians in jazz, and Doc Cheatham, the irrepressible and formidable 89-year-old trumpeter, opened the concert, aiming his trumpet at the ceiling as if he were thanking some higher power.
He performed lightly brushed and delicate solos, which he interrupted with his coy singing.
Backed by Chuck Folds on piano, Bucky Calabrese on bass and Jackie Williams on drums, he worked his way through "Rosetta," "I'm in the Market for You" and "Miss Brown to You."

Federal statutes would not be affected.

The City of New York warms up on a Sunday in early November like no other day of the year.
The weather may be hot or cold, but the day belongs to the New York City Marathon -- a 26.2-mile exhilaration.
The riveting event is a grueling exertion by some 28,000 runners.
Supporting them are more than a million cheering spectators, maybe two million, rooting for a relative or a friend somewhere in the pack, or just rooting for the pack.
Momentarily, a supercharged city is mellow.
The mass of marathoners is stunning in itself, streaming through the streets and struggling across the bridges.
But the mass of spectators -- fans, family and friends from near and far -- is key.
Ask any runner.
When exhaustion strikes, the cheers keep coming, lifting the dead-tired another block and then another mile and finally to the finish line.
"I've never seen people cheer like that," said Kenya's Ibrahim Hussein when he won in 1987.

3 Suspended For Groping At West Point
The United States Military Academy announced yesterday that three West Point football players who had groped female cadets at an October pep rally would be suspended from the team for the rest of the season.
But Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, criticized the punishment as too lenient and a Pentagon official said many more players must have been involved.
In addition to the suspension from the team, the three cadets were restricted to academy grounds for 90 days and given 80 hours of marching discipline.

Although many passengers express concern over flying in propeller-driven planes -- and some liken such flights to "riding on the back of a mosquito" -- a growing number of people are finding that propeller aircraft are the only type of planes flying to their destinations.
Major airlines are replacing jets with propeller planes on more and more routes as a way to cut costs in an industry that lost $12.8 billion over the last four years.

Russian Emigres Inundate Musical Life in Israel
In 1991 Avner Biron, a flutist and conductor of a small orchestra of friends and semi-professional musicians in the town of Rehovot not far from here, regretfully dismissed most of the ensemble's players.
There was an opportunity to improve the group significantly by using first-chair players from major orchestras: specifically, the Russians were coming.
Now the 33-member Israel Camerata of Rehovot, as Mr.
Biron's ensemble is called, is 90 percent Russian and is one of the most highly regarded orchestras in Israel.
Not far away, in Ramat Hasharon, a suburb of Tel Aviv, another chamber orchestra was formed four years ago, entirely composed of women.
Only one of the 13 string players -- the concert master, Vera Vaidman -- is not a recent Russian emigre.


On the Trail
Developments yesterday in campaigns in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
NEW YORK  Governor State Senator George E. Pataki sought to regain the initiative with a visit to the Staten Island boarding house where Thomas Grasso strangled an 81-year-old man in 1991, a murder the Republicans have used to ridicule Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo's opposition to the death penalty.
Mr.
Cuomo, meanwhile, assembled on the same stage three New York City mayors who may not agree on any other issue except their support for the Governor's re-election.
Comptroller Two more moderate Republican officials withdrew their support for Herbert London, their party's candidate for comptroller, accusing him of running a racially divisive and inflammatory campaign against the Democrat incumbent, H. Carl McCall.
City Councilmen Charles Millard and Andrew S. Eristoff joined the Republican county leader, State Senator Roy M. Goodman, in denouncing Mr.
London.
CONNECTICUT  Governor A state judge ruled that the Middlebury Police Department did not have to release a report on a domestic incident between John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate for governor, and his former wife.
The reason, the judge said, was that his former wife made allegations of criminal conduct that have not been corroborated.
NEW JERSEY  United States Senate Senator Frank Lautenberg denounced the National Rifle Association for mailing out endorsements of his Republican opponent, Chuck Haytaian, as Mr.
Haytaian accused his rival of accepting $2 million in contributions from other special interest groups.
Mr.
Lautenberg also said his endorsement from Ross Perot, the former Presidential candidate, proved he was an independent voice.

Both face wily Democratic incumbents, Lawton Chiles of Florida and Ann W. Richards of Texas, and both are in neck-and-neck races just four days before the elections.

The pitcher, whose career has been in decline, has 15 days left of a 60-day drug-related suspension that was interrupted by the players' strike and will serve an additional 168 days, the balance of the 1995 season, on the suspended list.

Death of an Aviator
"I want to be an astronaut," Lieut.
Kara S. Hultgreen told The Miami Herald last year.
"Most of the astronauts are Navy jet test pilots first. If you're not given the same opportunities, you can't compete on the same level."
Lieutenant Hultgreen earned the same opportunities.
She also incurred the same risks.
On Oct. 25 she was killed in a crash off Southern California, the 10th F-14 aviator to die in a training accident in that notoriously ungainly aircraft since 1992.
The cause is not yet known, but some of her fellow aviators offered a quick, unfounded and appallingly insensitive opinion.
Lieutenant Hultgreen died, they said in faxes to several California news organizations, because she was a woman -- and as such not up to playing on their team.

A Safer Russian Army
The Clinton Administration has made remarkable headway in its efforts to help Russia dismantle its nuclear forces.
Washington's engagement in this enterprise has reached levels that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.
The U.S. has built housing for former Soviet missile controllers; Pentagon officials now give virtually the same briefing on U.S. nuclear policy to Russia's Parliament as they give to Congress.
Unfortunately, Washington has not yet given equal attention to the need to downsize Moscow's non-nuclear forces.

A Rescue for 3 Georgia Plants as Sara Lee Exits
Diane Barnette scudded across the factory's maple floorboards, sewing machines buzzing like a swarm of hornets, stopped to scrutinize some T-shirts and spoke of the day the factory was to shut.
"It was a very, very traumatic day," she said, her blond hair bobbing above the din.
"They said that if they didn't find a buyer or some other arrangement, they would close it on Sept. 6. It hit us pretty hard. I guess we were in denial that this would happen." And it didn't, thanks to a local bank and a group of entrepreneurs.
For Ms.
Barnette, who rose from a sewing machine operator earning $1 an hour 24 years ago to plant manager today, and for the 200 seamstresses here who start at $4.25 an hour, the impending shutdown bordered on the apocalyptic.
"Everybody in this town has some connection with this place," she said.
"Really, you had a certain group of people here, this is what they do. This is what they know."
But the incessant drumbeat of international competition and the imperatives of the plant's owner, the Sara Lee Corporation in Chicago, signaled that the old mill in this north Georgia town of 12,000 was no longer needed, and that another small factory had to go.
Last June, Sara Lee, considered one of the best-managed consumer products companies, announced that to improve profits it would cut the number of plants making knitwear, fleecewear and men's and women's underwear.
"We were getting out of private label apparel manufacture, things like sweatshirts for the Gap, active wear." said Nancy Young, a spokeswoman.
"We decided to get out and announced this closing in August."
For the 230, mostly women, employees at the Cartersville factory of Spring City Knitting, a Winston-Salem, N.C., subsidiary of Sara Lee, and the 110 workers at a sister factory in Milledgeville about 120 miles away, unemployment seemed as inevitable as a rushing thunderstorm.
Jerry Kemp, a lean 45-year-old Kentuckian who moved to Cartersville years ago as a Sara Lee vice president, had other ideas.
The year before Mr.
Kemp and three partners formed Springtown Inc., which bought a former Sara Lee plant in Wrightsville, Ga., where 350 workers made men's underwear.
When news of the closing hit here and at a more modern plant in Midgeville, he agreed to buy them and to try to make a go of all three former Sara Lee plants.
"I like this area and wanted to raise my family here," said Mr.
Kemp, the father of two teen-agers.
"I wanted to get into business by myself."
He approached some friends, who had also spent their careers in the apparel business, and they poured their savings into the company.
Mr.
Kemp became its president.
"We all had a good understanding of what it would take to make this work," he said, "but probably the hardest part was putting together the financial package and making this competitive internationally." He sees tough times ahead for the apparel industry in the United States, particularly as global trade is liberalized.
Indeed, apparel industry employment has fallen 18 percent in the last decade, from 1.185 million workers in 1984 to 970,000 today, according to the American Apparel Manufacturers Association.
And over the same period, the association says, apparel imports climbed 159 percent, to $28.2 billion, not including foreign fur, rubber, leather and plastic apparel.
Under an unusual agreement, not yet final, Sara Lee donated the three factories to the state, which plans to enter into a lease-purchase agreement with Mr.
Kemp's company, Springtown Inc.
Eventually Springtown will own the factories and keep the local workers on the job.
Mr.
Kemp and his partners had some misgivings.
The Milledgeville plant could quickly make small batches of a wide range of knitwear and active wear and could be profitable.
But in Cartersville, "we decided to take a gamble," Mr.
Kemp said.
"This is a high-cost operation to run," he added.
"It's old. It's not automated. But because of the management, the people, and because we ourselves were here, we decided it was worth taking a chance."
David Dautel, Springtown's chief financial officer, said that the company had applied for two loans from the state for $250,000 each for the Milledgeville and Cartersville plants.
The state grants the money to the localities, which, in turn, lend to the company at below-market rates.
The loans are repaid over five to seven years to the localities, which can then relend the money to others.
Putting the deal together involved persuading a nearby bank, the Trust Company Bank of Northwest Georgia, in Rome, that he and his partners could make a go of Sara Lee's old plants.
David Johnson, the bank's senior loan officer, said: "I'd say the first question we asked was 'If they couldn't do it, why can you?' " After all, Sara Lee had a reputation for knowing how to run plants efficiently.
But the bank, Mr.
Johnson said, was encouraged because Mr.
Kemp and his partners had spent their working lives in the business, Sara Lee's existing contracts were inherited by Springtown, the market and cost projections looked good, and interviews with Springtown customers were positive.
"We asked them who is their primary market," Mr.
Johnson said.
"If they are making for Russell, that's a pretty strong company. If they're making for Jockey, that's a pretty strong company. We will call the company and ask how comfortable they are with the company -- can they produce a quality product at a competitive price?"
He said that the fact the bank was lending to Springtown in Cartersville, which is on the fringe of its usual business territory, was an expression of confidence.
"Our interest is in Cartersville," he said.
"It is a viable employer. It has great potential and is important to the community there."
While Mr.
Kemp wants plants that can produce garments that were not being made by others, he said he was also determined to save jobs, even if it appeared risky.
"They're good people here, and a lot of these jobs are in towns where there's not a lot of opportunity," he said.
"Just writing this off is just not right."
In starting an apparel company, Mr.
Kemp and his partners, like mice scampering between the legs of elephants, are trying to find niches in the market and to compete aggressively.
It is not easy, he admitted.
"First," he continued, "our niche is in active wear and underwear, mostly contract manufacture," for other labels.
"We want people like the Gap or Jockey or Calvin Klein. When they want a lounge or a fashion kind of underwear, we're the people who come to mind."
Mr.
Dautel, the financial officer, said that the company's expectations for the Cartersville plant hinged on transforming it into an efficient headquarters with a computerized inventory system and into the central distribution point for the company's other two factories.
And while the Georgia plants are the core of his company, Mr.
Kemp acknowledged that it needed lower-cost foreign operations to survive.
For that, Springtown recently bought a small plant in Honduras.
"Our thinking is long term, we wanted to be both domestic and offshore," he said.
Although it is yet early, the company is off to a good start, Mr.
Kemp said.
"Business is strong," he said.
"We hit it on an upswing. We have a good reputation, and we try to service the business we have well. We've been fortunate. We have people who believe we'll be successful."
And, he said, the company is depending as well on the strength of its work force.
"The folks in all these plants have been very supportive," he said.
"They've hung in there. I wouldn't have even considered it without having them. They're really what makes it happen."
Ms.
Barnette finished her whirl through the factory, from sewing room to inspection tables, to bundling and packaging.
"All in all, it's not a bad place to work, or I wouldn't have stuck around for 24 years," she said.
"If this had closed, it would never have opened again."

From a cobblestoned block away, the raucous chatter of a packed saloon booms out, the noise of drinkers downing cocktails like "Greyhound," "Orgasm" and "B-52." At Jo's Bar, where burritos and burgers are menu staples, young Americans gather to celebrate being expatriates in a city that for them is cheap and chic.
But to the citizens of Prague, who for the last five years have watched Americans settle in to make money, dispense advice and in the case of the 20-somethings have a good time, the novelty of the newcomers is wearing off.

Bronx Group Is Challenging A Planned Merger by Chase
A Bronx community group has challenged an unusual application by the Chase Manhattan Corporation to merge its bank in Connecticut into its lead bank in New York City.
The group, Inner City Press/Community on the Move, said in a filing with Federal bank regulators that the merger should be denied because Chase does not lend enough in minority and low-income areas of the Bronx and upper Manhattan.
The Federal Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to meet the credit needs of communities they serve and allows regulators to block mergers for banks that do not comply.
The challenge by Inner City Press could delay Chase's plans if the Government sees merits in the group's claims.

A New York State Tax Amnesty, but Not for New Yorkers
In a little-publicized program that expires at the end of this month, New York State is taking a carrot-and-stick approach to tax amnesty.
The carrot: penalties will be forgiven for those who confess and file delinquent returns for 1986 through 1993.
The stick: new computer prowess makes it possible to catch nonfilers who could escape notice a decade ago.
And when the state succeeds, it is assessing hefty penalties and interest, tax professionals say.

Dow Plunges 38.36 After Jobs Report
Once again Wall Street took fright at news that Main Street was doing well.
The Government's report yesterday that the unemployment rate had fallen to a four-year low rekindled fears that a too-strong economy would produce an inflation rate that would hurt stocks and bonds.
Stocks dropped even though the dollar stabilized and the earnings season was coming to a close with a surprising number of companies reporting results that beat Wall Street's expectations.


Reviews/Fashion; Klein and Karan: Clothes That Do the Job
Runway shows in their current incarnation could borrow the title from Dorothy Parker's anthology of fiction, "Here Lies." Many women will never wear those clothes.
But Calvin Klein and Donna Karan represent a certain truth: that working women need to be taken seriously, and that they need clothes that will do the job.
On the closing day of the New York collections, the two designers demonstrated why women have turned to them for relief from a cacophony of fashion messages.
Clanking discordant music shrieked like a cat being plucked at Mr.
Klein's show.
Even Fran Lebowitz, his good friend, winced and plugged one ear as Kate Moss emerged in a stern black suit.
But even though the music went on throbbing, Ms.
Lebowitz dropped her hand eventually.
The ears, of course, adjust.


Dreaminess Just Behind The Twang
Nanci Griffith may be the closest thing to a figure from a Eudora Welty novel that pop music has produced.
Born and reared in western Texas, this 40-year-old singer and songwriter has the aura of a homespun farm girl with poetry in her soul and wanderlust in her eyes.
While her voice has a hard Texan twang that evokes a stubborn willfulness and true grit, behind that twang is a childlike dreaminess.
That quality comes to the fore in ballads like "There's a Light Beyond These Woods (Mary Margaret)," Ms.
Griffith's plaintive reminiscence of an adolescent friendship.

Murdered Children: In Most Cases, a Parent Did It
It seems an unthinkable crime: mothers killing their children.
But statistics show that in the United States, when young children are slain, the parents are usually their murderers.
And in the past two weeks alone, three mothers have been charged either with killing their children or conspiring with the men in their lives to do so.
In Union, S.C., Susan V. Smith's tearful pleas to the man she said had driven away with her two young sons brought national publicity, but the local police said on Thursday that she had confessed to killing them.
Yesterday she was charged with their murder.

Remembering Megan
Children are more apt to be sexually abused in the home than outside it.
Even so, the threat posed by an unknown predator terrifies American families the most.
That is the reason for the community-notification provision that is now part of Federal law -- and for the New Jersey bills that inspired it.
The nine-bill package known as Megan's law, signed by Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey this week, contains some of the nation's most stringent restrictions on sex offenders.
Community-notification laws have been struck down as unconstitutional in five states, but upheld in Washington State.
Perhaps New Jersey's can surmount any legal challenges that are almost certain to come its way.
But however much it appeases the genuinely righteous anger of those appalled by the death of 7-year-old Megan Kanka last summer, allegedly at the hands of a twice-convicted sex offender named Jesse Timmendequas, Megan's law may not be the protection its supporters think it is.


Lautenberg Attacked on Age and Incumbency
In his first race for the United States Senate 12 years ago, Frank R. Lautenberg raised the question of whether his 72-year-old opponent, Representative Millicent Fenwick, was past her political prime, questioning her "fitness" and "her ability to do the job."
Six years later, in one of the most acrimonious political campaigns in New Jersey history, he sought to convince voters that his rival, Pete Dawkins, was out of touch.


Let Me Tell You
Last year, I invited students at the Alternative Junior/ Senior High School here to participate in a writing project called "Let Me Tell You." Founded 24 years ago for teen-agers with severe learning and behavior problems, the school accepts students who are unwanted by their home school districts or have failed at other institutions.
More than 30 young men and women took part in the writing group, and for our final project I asked them to discuss issues that directly affect their lives.
Here are some excerpts.
Keep Positive I am 90 percent African-American.
My desires and my goals are to be a choreographer, an actor, a singer, a writer, a model, an African-American activist.
To keep myself motivated, I pick role models.
I put inspiring themes on my bedroom wall.
To be positive, you have to think positively.
I am determined.
I know times are going to be hard.
I know I have strikes against me.
I have come a long way.
I want to take further steps.
Being a teen-ager and black in the world today is very hard.
You never know what's going to happen.
We live in a world of racism, hate, prejudice and other problems.
Today for me and for others we need more racial pride and more racial identity.
You Can't Win P eople think that because I take Ritalin my brain is messed up.
Just because I handle things differently and my thoughts might be on another cloud from yours does not mean I'm messed up in the head.
To me life is just a game you can't win.
Why can't you win?
The answer is clear to me: you are not supposed to win because the object is not to win.
The object is just to play for fun.
I could never express myself very well through words -- that's why I turned to music to show other people how I feel.
Other people never really get my ideas though.
When I look at the world today, I see hunger, pain, misery, drugs and crime.
Making a Future People call me C-Dog.
I have been to hell and back.
I have been shot in the leg.
I could have died.
I have been to every school in Rochester.
My mother and I have been through some tragic things.
My father died when I was 11 months.
My life was going downhill, but I'm in a comfortable school now, and I'm about to try and turn my life around.
My mother works two jobs.
I'm still alive.
I want to go to college.
The real issues in the world today are crime, guns, us, our community.
I know why people are killing each other.
People are killing each other because they don't have a future.
People live on the streets today, and no one cares about them.
Ever since I was in third grade I was a follower, but now that I have seen what is going on in the world I strongly believe I can be a leader.
It's hard.
I have to keep on pushing myself.
I want to graduate and make my family proud, and most important I want to make myself proud.
-- Collice, 17 I Prefer Animals I am a very polite person.
I like to practice different languages.
My favorite music is jazz.
I like pop and blues, too.
I spend most of my time working at my house.
I like to play basketball in my backyard or play football in the street.
I am not a perfect person, but who is?
I like animals better than humans.
At times an animal is my best friend.
My favorite subjects in school are science and social studies.
I like everything that is natural.
Lately I have been thinking about the way drugs go around.
I think people should go to church and put their money in church instead of drugs or cigarettes.
Most people today are greedy, and that's why I do not care for money.
Animals are not greedy.
Animals are not wasteful.  -- Patrick, 15 One Dream I want to make it in the world.
Maybe I can be an actor or a singer.
I want to be somebody for my people.
When I get older I want to do something that nobody can do but me.
This is my one dream.
I have learned that if you want something in this world you have to take the initiative and work to the best of your ability.
One other thing I have learned is that I am no different from a grain of sand on the beach.
Attitude I could care less about being on an honor roll.
At this school before lunch we have 10 minutes of free reading.
I have started a book.
I have enjoyed reading the book.
I am getting toward the end, and I don't like the thought of coming to the end of the book.
My favorite kind of music is heavy metal.
My favorite group is Slayer.
I think a lot of my attitude comes from the music I listen to.
I'm not saying music gives me a bad attitude -- just sometimes music goes with the mood.
The most important thing in my life is my family.
At this time in my life my family is having a lot of problems.
My family puts a lot of pressure on me, and right now I'm trying not to let that bother me too much.
Childhood Walking through the outside air, the cold spring is all in my hair.
It is dark.
It is wet.
It is gloomy.
The ground is wet and soggy.
It is like I am dark and secluded, not in a violent sense, in a sad sense.
I like to sleep.
Sometimes I wish I would never wake up.
I want to sleep under water.
My wish is to be blind and deaf so I could never see or hear the wrong doing.
Childhood brings memories.
I lost my childhood the day I was born.
I was always on my own.
Maybe in some way I was happy as a child, not in the sense of anyone being nice, but in the sense of so much happened.
-- Jason, 16 Face It Drugs, crime, drugs are everywhere today.
People fight and kill and hurt others for a buck.
It is hard trying to make it in this lifetime.
I don't believe drugs and crime will stop.
Today we have to learn to live with murder, rape, robberies, fights.
We have to learn to deal with them.
We have to stop turning our heads the other way.
We have to face the facts of life.  -- John, 19

Mayor's Future? It's Ahead
Ever since Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani crossed party lines and endorsed Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, some Republicans have speculated about his political ambitions.
Mr.
Giuliani confronted the subject yesterday on his weekly radio show on WABC-AM (770) when a caller named Mark asked him to state his intentions for higher office.
"So what I've always followed in my career is: You do not rule things out that you can't speculate about at this point. So the fact is, the choice I made for governor was made based on the job that I have to do for the next three to three and half years as Mayor of New York City. I was elected to take care of the interests of the people of New York City, to do the best that I can to do that. . . .
"I'd like to be a successful mayor. And I'm not thinking beyond that."


Senator's Employee Lacked Work Papers, Agency Says
Clearing the official record but further muddying the political scene, the Immigration and Naturalization Service reported today that a Guatemalan woman was in the country illegally when she was employed as a housekeeper by Senator Dianne Feinstein from 1980 to 1982.
Immigration officials said a search of the records of the housekeeper, Annabella del Rosario Legrand-Cabrera Realegeno, showed that during much, if not all, of the two years that she had worked for Ms.
Feinstein, a Democrat who was the Mayor of San Francisco at the time, she held no visa or work permit.


Reviews/Fashion; The V-Shaped Jacket of the 1940's Makes a U-Turn
Richard Tyler was born in Australia, his headquarters are in Los Angeles and his heart is in Hollywood.
He made his name by designing for entertainers, and his love of the movies really came through in the spring collection he showed Thursday night
He was thinking about 1940's Hollywood, he said before the show, about a time when actresses like Katharine Hepburn and Marlene Dietrich wore broad-shouldered, narrow-waisted jackets.


Gooden Suspended for 1995 After Additional Drug Tests
Dwight Gooden, continuing to test positive for cocaine use, received a career-jeopardizing penalty yesterday.
A free agent who is no longer a member of the Mets, Gooden was suspended for the entire 1995 season.
The pitcher, whose career has been in decline, has 15 days left of a 60-day drug-related suspension that was interrupted by the players' strike and will serve an additional 168 days, the balance of the 1995 season, on the suspended list.


In Search of the First 'Pumpion-Pye'
To the Editor:
Re "Consider the Pumpkin" (editorial, Oct. 31):


Voters Agree They're Tired of Being Taxed, and Congress Gets the Blame
Along the highways of southeastern Pennsylvania, from the multiethnic blue-collar subdivisions of industrial Norristown, Allentown and Bethlehem to the malls and living rooms in the tonier villages of the Lehigh Valley and the Main Line, people who plan to vote in next week's elections are peeved about one issue above all others: taxes.
Property taxes, income taxes, Social Security and Medicare taxes, cigarette and alcohol taxes, trash collection taxes -- all are on the rise, the result of budgetary strains from City Hall to the White House.
So ubiquitous are tax increases that the issue has emerged as the common, largely nonpartisan denominator of voter discontent and the root of the anti-incumbent fervor evident in many polls.

Not Guilty Verdict for Taylor
Brien Taylor, once the blue-chip pitcher of the Yankee farm system, is hoping that the injuries clouding his future will be resolved as favorably and decisively as the criminal proceeding against him was on Thursday.
District Judge Horton Rountree of Carteret County in North Carolina found Taylor not guilty of two misdemeanor charges relating to a scuffle the left-hander was involved in last Dec. 18 near his home in Beaufort, N.C.
Taylor, who turns 23 next month, is recovering from arthroscopic surgery to the left shoulder he injured in the incident and is not expected to pitch in a game until at least February.
He was baseball's top draft pick in 1991, when he received a record bonus of $1.55 million.


Picasso X Has Puissance Pizazz
McLain Ward and his magnificent mount, Golo 63, were gunning for a world record and their second Puissance victory in two weeks tonight.
They got neither.
Picasso X, a 9-year-old Hanoverian bay gelding ridden by Thomas Buholzer of Switzerland, was the only one of the five horses remaining in the second jumpoff to clear the winning height of 7 feet 2 inches at the 111th National Horse Show.


Bronx Christmas Tree Seller Is Fatally Shot in His Office
The day after last Thanksgiving, as Glenn Walker set up Christmas trees for sale on a Bronx lot, two men in leather coats strode up and demanded $3,000 to let him stay in business.
A week after he refused, firebombs on successive days were hurled into his lot and $6,000 in trees went up in smoke.
Mr.
Walker, who lived in Florida but had come to New York for years to sell watermelons in summer, pumpkins in the fall and trees at Christmas, declined to cooperate with police and fire investigators and the case, widely publicized and featured on a national television program, went unsolved.

A Fugitive Appears in Mexican Ads
A fugitive Mexican banker who has eluded an international manhunt for almost two months re-emerged this week, but only in Mexican newspapers.
Though he remains on the run, Carlos Cabal Peniche declared in an audacious "open letter to public opinion" published in full-page ads in several Mexico City papers Thursday that he was retaining control of his businesses, including the Del Monte Fresh Produce Company of Florida.
Mexican officials promptly dismissed the claim as impossible.

College Is Returning Statue to Okinawa
A statue taken from Okinawa by victorious American marines at the close of World War II will be returned by Rollins College, a small liberal arts school in Florida to which an alumnus donated the work in 1946, the college's president said on Thursday.
In March, Shizuo Kishaba, president of the Ryukyu-America Historical Research Society in Okinawa, visited Rollins and asked for the return of the three-foot bronze.

Republican Candidate Loses Officials' Support
Accusing him of running a racially divisive campaign for state comptroller, two more Republican officials from Manhattan yesterday withdrew their support for their party's candidate, Herbert London.
The officials -- City Councilmen Charles Millard and Andrew S. Eristoff -- joined the Republican county leader, State Senator Roy M. Goodman in criticizing Mr.
London's campaign against the Democratic incumbent, H. Carl McCall.
In particular, they criticized a recent newspaper ad placed by London supporters calling Mr.
McCall "non-Kosher" and a television commercial, which was prepared but never broadcast, that began with the words "Kill the Jews?" followed by pictures of Mr.
McCall, who is black.


Bridge
The first National Par Contest was played Sunday night, with 301 entrants playing in their own homes, eyes glued to computer screens.

The Breeders' Cup Is Now a World Cup
From Lure, who has won two Breeders' Cup races in a row without winning a championship, to Best Pal, who has paid more than $1 million in supplemental fees without getting anything back, 91 horses were primed today for the 11th Breeders' Cup series at Churchill Downs.
In seven races with $10 million in purses, and with betting that will exceed $80 million in 46 countries, they will run for the honors already claimed by the vacationing Holy Bull.
He is in residence at Gulfstream Park in Florida, the winner of 8 races in 10 starts this year and the pre-emptor of the title Horse of the Year.
But in his place will come a herd of star horses from the United States, Canada, England, Ireland and France.


Should Allen Ginsberg Want to Starve?
To the Editor:
Re "Allen Ginsberg, Millionaire?" by Michael Blumenthal (Op-Ed, Oct. 29): The implicit assumption that artists should starve, indeed should want to starve, is an outdated, punitive notion held over from the 19th century, when capitalists supplanted the aristocracy and the church as patrons of art.


Should Allen Ginsberg Want to Starve?
To the Editor:
Michael Blumenthal asserts falsely that Allen Ginsberg "made friends with Castro" (Op-Ed, Oct. 29).
In 1965 Mr.
Ginsberg visited Cuba and was shortly expelled because of his un-Communist behavior.


Another Fatal Plunge Has Cornell Asking Whether Its Gorges Inspire Student Suicides
Despondency is common at American universities at final exam time, or just when the cold fall weather sets in, or even when the new semester gets under way, bringing with it the fear of failure, the sense of isolation or just the peculiar hopelessness that sometimes grips young people who would appear, otherwise, to have everything to live for.
And so, when a 21-year-old former student at Cornell University took his own life yesterday morning, it was not a very uncommon occurence.
Campus officials said the young man, Dustin D. Klingbergs of Chardon, Ohio, died when he leapt into a steep, rocky gorge that runs the entire length of the hilly Cornell campus.

Tennessee Campaign Is Central To Republicans' Senate Hopes
Republican hopes of winning control of the Senate rest heavily in Tennessee.
The party needs to take at least seven seats now held by Democrats to win a majority in the Senate, and two are at stake here, notably the one held by Jim Sasser.


Accusations At U.A.W.
The Labor Department is investigating accusations that the leading candidate for president of the United Automobile Workers union may have improperly influenced the awarding of contracts for workers' eye-care benefits, The Detroit Free Press reported today.
An investigator for the department's racketeering section in Detroit, Craig Woodhouse, declined to confirm whether an investigation was in progress.
But The Free Press reported that at least 11 people had been questioned by investigators about possible ties between Stephen Yokich, the candidate who is now a union vice president, and Avery Sterling Jr., owner of Sterling Vision Shoppes Inc. of Mount Clemons, Mich.
The Free Press said that the 11 people spoke to it on the condition of anonymity.

In the last week, both the Government of President Aristide and the United Nations, which authorized the American military intervention in Haiti that began on Sept. 19, have expressed dismay at the lack of security around the country.

A picture caption on Thursday about Chuck Haytaian, the Republican candidate for United States Senate in New Jersey, misstated his current positon and referred incorrectly to a campaign event in Iselin, N.J.
Mr.
Haytaian is Speaker of the State Assembly, not majority leader of the State Senate.
At Iselin, he spoke from his campaign bus, not from a train.
In some editions, because of an editing error, the related article misstated Mr.
Haytaian's tenure as Speaker.
He has held the post for three and a half years, not seven.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: Nissan 300ZX Turbo; No Age Restrictions Apply
IT'S a big country, and Americans are big people.
We like Big Macs, Big Gulps and Biggie Fries.
We like our cars big, too -- even the small ones.
This poses a challenge in building a "world car," a vehicle that can be made and sold globally with only small concessions to local tastes.
The Japanese are masters at this, but Detroit has never been able to make Americans fall in love with Opels adored by Germans, or set foreigners swooning over the Pinto or the Chevette.

In a Glum Election Season, Politics as Unusual
FOR at least 25 years, since he won the vice presidency of the Bronx High School of Science's student body in a hot election, Arthur Z. Schwartz has been passionately interested in politics.
The next few days are his World Series.
But this season, the fan in Mr.

"I'm a boomer," said Mr.
Schwartz, who is 41 years old.
"My wife and I are both professionals. We have two kids I love to play with and a house I hate to leave. It would be disruptive to my family and my law practice. And I'm just as shy as I was in high school about walking up to people and asking them to vote for me. And yet . . ."

Winning at the Transition Game
After one game, one victory and 120 points, the Knicks believe they can become a more explosive offensive team.
New York's running game was in high gear during Friday's 120-107 season-opening victory against the Boston Celtics at the Boston Garden.
The Knicks scored 54 points on either dunks or layups, using a transition game that looked far more potent than the methodical New York offense that averaged 98.5 points last season.

What a Soap Opera: Buddy Ryan, the Eagles and a Basin of Water
A day before his Cardinals team was to take the field against his former Eagles team, Buddy Ryan sat in an overstuffed chair in a meeting room of an airport hotel today getting his feet washed by a local sportscaster who vilified Ryan during his tenure in Philadelphia.
It wasn't an act of subservience that Howard Eskins was performing, but more like an act of charity.
Eskins, who works at KYW Channel 3 in Philadelphia, was fulfilling the sports fantasy of a man who donated $800 to the Eagles' fund-raiser for leukemia and Ryan, for agreeing to having his feet washed, was receiving a free pair of boots.
Eskins also had to apologize for all the negative things that he had said about Ryan in the past.

In the past three years 24 passengers have been killed on such flights, most recently when a helicopter crashed in July.
That accident, which killed three people, was one of two helicopter crashes in a single week, and the 11th crash in just six months in which people were killed or injured while touring Hawaii by air.

Illness Linked to Ice Cream Appears in 28 States
The outbreak of salmonella linked to ice cream from Minnesota has spread to at least 28 states, officials of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this week.
The Federal health agency, based here, said laboratory analysis has confirmed 489 cases of salmonella linked to ice cream products produced by Schwan's Sales Enterprises of Marshall, Minn.
Officials have said the ice cream might have been contaminated when it was carried in a tanker truck that previously held raw eggs, a common source of the bacteria that cause salmonella.


Dengue Fever
To the Editor: The report about dengue fever (Travel Advisory: "Dengue Fever Cases Rise in Puerto Rico," Oct. 16) omitted facts vital to anyone considering a trip to Puerto Rico: Neither the local government of Puerto Rico nor the Federal agencies based here sees the need for travelers to avoid Puerto Rico because of dengue fever.
For that reason, no travel advisory has been issued.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have stated quite clearly that the chances of a traveler's contracting the disease is very remote.


Oct.2-Nov.5: 36-Second Plunge; A Storm, a Plane Crash And 68 People Dead
Why American Eagle flight 4184 to Chicago dropped out of a stormy sky and plowed into an Indiana soybean field Monday may not be known for months.
But a buildup of ice on the wings of the twin-engine turbo-prop aircraft is an early suspect in the crash, which killed all 68 people on board.
Another area of inquiry is the plane's autopilot system, which was on just before the doomed aircraft began rolling to the right in the freezing temperatures, flipped over on its back and plunged to earth in 36 seconds.

Taking A Stroll Down 'Sunset Boulevard'
THAT SOUND YOU HEAR is the whoosh of tickets along the route of "Sunset Boulevard." With a $32 million advance sale and more publicity than its producers probably even wanted (starting with the first lawsuit), it has finally reached Broadway.
Now in previews at the Minskoff Theater, it opens on Nov. 17 with Glenn Close as the haunted Norma Desmond, the role she stamped her own in Los Angeles late last year.
The Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, based on the 1950 Billy Wilder film with Gloria Swanson, also stars George Hearn, as Max von Mayerling, Norma's major-domo; Alan Campbell as Joe Gillis, the 30-ish screenwriter the aging actress falls in love with; Alice Ripley as the young woman he is drawn to, and Alan Oppenheimer as Cecil B. DeMille.

Bringing Home Bacon Isn't Protecting Veterans
His big hands strangling the steering wheel of a rented white Bonneville, Representative Jack Brooks tooled down the byways of his hometown and its surrounding flatlands this week, past fire-spewing refineries and antebellum mansions and stands of scrub pine, demonstrating why people here have sent him to Congress for 42 uninterrupted years.

The Oct. 30 article, "Vox Pop Video: A Public Access TV Guide," with its glib, condescending tone, does a disservice to public access and to your readers.


A City-Cool Foursome Groovin' to the Beat
WHEN IT COMES TO LIFE in an average American city, most current pop sends a fairly consistent message: Stay away or get caught in the crossfire.
Whether it's the turf wars depicted in gangster rap or the suffocating tension heard in urban metal bands, cities are grim, soul-depleting battlefields; earplugs and bulletproof vests are as vital to survival as a Walkman.
Pop musicians are often right, of course; city life can be a wearying, disconcerting grind.
But just as often a city's mix of styles and sounds -- and the joyful mess that results when they clash -- can be as invigorating as a sudden breeze on a hot day, which is where the all-female quartet Luscious Jackson comes in.
The cover of the band's first album, "Natural Ingredients" (Grand Royal/Capitol CDP 7243-8-28356; all three formats), is crammed with graffiti -- in particular, the fat-lettered Day-Glo style that sprang up during the early day of hip-hop.
There's no better starting place for music that -- hard as it is to believe these days -- actually celebrates the idea of living and surviving in a city.


The Barnstorming of New York Candidates
From the Brooklyn waterfront to Brookhaven, L.I., to a rally in Rochester, the man who wants a fourth term as Governor and the men who would succeed him sped into the last weekend of an election campaign that will test the power of anti-incumbent anger and perhaps reshape New York politics.
With the towers of lower Manhattan looming behind him, Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, one of this year's tallest Democratic targets, announced the creation of a task force to oversee a long-planned redevelopment of decrepit piers into a commercial and recreational complex, then went off to a rally in the Bronx aimed at inspiring the high urban turnout he needs to win.

Kuwait's Oil Industry Rises From the Ashes of War

What's Fair for Childless Workers?
To the Editor:
As professionally employed baby boomer homeowners without children, we reject the suggestion that it is somehow unfair for people like us to be expected to share in the cost of public education through our property taxes.
To view this as discriminatory is merely an example of how far the "Me-First Generation" will go to foster a whining culture of victimization in which virtually anyone can claim membership in an oppressed minority group and rationalize the shirking of one's basic social responsibilities.
We all benefit from a healthy democratic society, but its well being depends on a strong public education system.

Western-Style Scramble for Students
For decades the Japanese have criticized but done virtually nothing about an education system that produces one of the most literate and disciplined work forces on earth, yet stifles creativity and limits diversity among its students.
Now, after years of fruitless debate, a solution may have arrived: A growing shortage of applicants is forcing the country's universities to consider the most farreaching changes since their founding.
Demographics rather than a shift in values is behind the new thinking.
The birth rate is tumbling and Japanese society is aging with remarkable speed.
Within 30 years the number of people over 65 will soar to 25 percent of the population, from the current 12 percent.
The number of 18-year-olds peaked in 1992, and is expected to drop steadily in coming years.
Yoshiya Abe, an expert on education policy at Aichi Gakiun University, near Nagoya, said there would be 20 percent fewer university applicants in the year 2000, a figure that is sending shock waves through Japan's educational factories.
Now universities, which traditionally accepted only the students they wanted after putting them through a battery of mind-numbing exams, are changing their standards as they compete for students.
They are accepting students based on recommendations or skill in sports like rugby.
In other words, students are slowly finding their outside interests encouraged rather than regarded as distractions from the tasks of memorizing dates and facts.
In another change, universities have begun to trim costs.
Up to now, parents have paid vast sums to insure their children spots at good universities because diplomas from the right schools -- rather than the student's academic record -- have been the most important criteria for jobs at the best companies and government ministries.
In a startling report issued earlier this year, the Government found that Japanese parents with two children spent nearly 16 percent of their incomes on education -- with much of it on cram schools to prepare youngsters for the rigorous and minutely detailed entrance exams at middle schools, high schools and universities.
By contrast, the survey found, American parents spend on average less than 3 percent of their income on their children's education.

The World; Japan Asks Why A Prophet Bothers
EXCEPT for a brief period during the 1960's, Kenzaburo Oe has been the sort of intellectual, left-leaning author who was well known among brooding Japanese undergraduates and scholars, but was not particularly widely read.
Still, when he became the surprise choice for the Nobel Prize in Literature last month, most Japanese, even if they could not name any of his books, took pride in this affirmation of the richness of their culture.
And they left the matter at that.
But Mr.
Oe has not let them off so lightly.
This owlish, fidgety man, who loves to talk in excited bursts, toss out French phrases and explicate "Moby Dick," caused outrage by doing something dangerously unfashionable here: He took a stand on principle.


Take an Appetite. You'll Surely Need It.
ONE might have questions about a restaurant that calls itself Zero Zero, but at this amiable spot in Stamford, near the Greenwich line, the only question should be, how long to fast before a visit?
Zero Zero, whose name bears no relation to the upbeat decor -- walls and floor hand-painted with stylized flowers, every tabletop painted in different colors with an individualized, cheery motif -- offers a somewhat different concept in dining: not less is more, but more is more.
Every item except dessert bears two prices, the larger one for a family-size portion, the smaller for a single serving.
In fact, the so-called single serving can often accommodate two healthy appetites.

However, I recognize that while Shakespeare and his peers were published with great acclaim, women and many other minorities were ignored.

From high in his machine-gun turret, Pfc.

On the filthy street, a bone-thin old Haitian woman blows him a kiss, then stretches both arms to him, eyes closed, head thrown back, face alight with a wide and beatific smile.
If he never gets any closer to love and adoration for the rest of his life, he has seen it on this garbage-strewn sidewalk in Port-au-Prince.


Correction
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the feud between Harrison and Wallace McCain over the future management of McCain Foods Ltd., a large Canadian company they founded, referred incorrectly to some holdings of another family, the Hafts, who are involved in a similar dispute.

Dart Drugs was sold to its employees in 1984.
Crown Books is 51 percent owned by the Dart Group Corporation of Landover, Md., of which the Hafts are the major stockholders.

At Wind River, Cautious Steps Toward Capitalism
WHEN Patrick Goggles sees tourists streaming through the Wind River Indian Reservation to Yellowstone National Park, he sees money -- money that isn't flowing to his Northern Arapaho tribe.
Tourists spend $1.6 billion a year in Wyoming, and the Arapaho are moving only belatedly to extract the tourist gold that Anglo businesses just outside the reservation have mined for generations.
As general manager of the Northern Arapaho Trust, which manages the tribe's investments, Mr.
Goggles oversees a venture that includes a small group of retail and service businesses that serve tourists and tribal members alike.
These enterprises sometimes lure tourists traveling to and from Wyoming's biggest draws -- Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks -- but not often enough, and Mr.
Goggles wants to lure more.

Geography Put Back In the Future
CLARK UNIVERSITY in Worcester, Mass., has seen the future and it is geography.
Long ago abandoned as a separate discipline by many colleges, which incorporated it into subjects like global studies, geography has a new life in the new age.
"Environmental issues are becoming dominant on the heels of the cold war," said Dr.
Roger Kasperson, the Clark provost -- and a geographer by training.
Clark is creating an Environmental School "to reconcile economic development and economic growth with environmental issues," he said.


Hail and Farewell
The other day, I telephoned my friend Allison with devastating news: a mutual friend of ours had died the night before.
His name was Franco Moschino.
That neither of us had ever met him didn't matter.
He was the designer whose creations made us happiest.
And right now, all over the world, women who knew him no better than we did are grieving with us, because Moschino was more than a label; he was a sister under the skin.
I used to think Moschino was pronounced mo-SHEEN-o.
Actually, it sounds like "mosquito," and indeed Franco was a nimble bug on the nose of high fashion, a prankster with a rebel yell: "Stop the Fashion System!" What so endeared him to his customers was his take-no-prisoners wit.
How could you not love this crew-cut guy who appeared in his own hosiery ads wearing fish-net stockings?
His zany stunts -- i.e., sending Miss Piggy down the runway as the bride -- turned high fashion into high comedy.
Depending on your perspective, that was either a source of amusement or consternation.
Yet who could resist a scarf with the "designer" logo "Moscalvin Klino"?
Or a coat trimmed with teddy bears?
That he lived modestly and divided his earnings among a pediatric AIDS hospice and other charities made Moschino popular even among his critics.

TODAY Because of the New York City Marathon, several streets will be closed for much of the day, including, in Manhattan, First Avenue from 59th Street north to the Willis Avenue Bridge; Fifth Avenue from 102d to 120th Street, and Central Park South from Fifth Avenue to Columbus Circle.
In Brooklyn, part of Fourth Avenue from 84th Street to Flatbush Avenue will be closed.
In addition, some lanes on the Queensboro, Willis Avenue, Pulaski and Madison Avenue bridges will be closed for parts of the day.
The upper level of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge will be closed in both directions from midnight to 2 P.M.
All Staten Island-bound traffic on the bridge will be halted from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M. and the bridge will be completely closed from 9 A.M. to about 11:20.
The race begins at 10:47 A.M.


Ideas &amp; Trends; When a Woman Earns Like a Man
From the day laborer to the millionaire, the wife's worn dress or flashing jewels, her low roof or her lordly one, her weary feet or her rich equipage -- those speak of the economic ability of the husband.  -- Charlotte Perkins Gilman, 1898 HUSBAND, the noun, was orginally a management title: it meant the manager of a household.
The verb means to manage economically.
Wife, the noun, was no title at all: in its obscure Germanic roots it meant simply "woman." Its spousal connotation came later.
Which may help explain why the small but growing number of women who earn more than men are leading society into uncharted territory.

Lawsuits Against Tobacco Companies May Be Consolidated
After 40 years and 400 unsuccessful lawsuits, smokers suing tobacco companies have won the chance to consolidate millions of cases into a few or possibly a single anti-tobacco case.
In the past, tobacco trials have taken up to 10 years and cost several million dollars each, and even the one case in which a plaintiff won a jury award, of $400,000 -- Cipollone v.
Liggett Group -- the plaintiff was forced to abandon the case in the end, when faced with further appeals and millions of dollars in legal action before the award could be claimed.
Plaintiffs' lawyers see the class action suit as a way of combating the strength of many tobacco companies, which can make liability cases long and expensive.

It Started With Pitting Calamata Olives
IT all started when Nick Boboris heard a restaurant chef, who was preparing a dish that required Greek olives saying, "Life would be much simpler if these olives were pitted." Mr.

Always on the lookout for new products to sell to restaurants, specialty stores and supermarkets, Mr.
Boboris decided to explore removing the pits from the Calamata olives that he imports from Greece.
He knew that green pitted California olives, dyed black, were available in markets.

What Grass-Roots Women Advocate
It was with much regret and disappointment that I read "Assaying the Implications of Women's Resistance to Equality"  [ Oct. 9 ]  about Sherrye Henry, whose book purports to be about women and equality.
Obviously Sherrye Henry has not done all her homework.
Ms.
Henry is a proud self-avowed feminist, but those of us who have worked for many years in the feminist movement, to create change for women, take offense at her claim.
It is obvious to many of us, even to those who worked hard on Ms.
Henry's political campaign, that she is a woman of the privileged South, which has infected her view of feminism.
Ms.
Henry at the very opening of her book, which is ironically called "The Deep Divide," does nothing more than divide women by class, gender and race.
Throughout the book she consistently refers to "us" and "them," by "us" meaning the privileged few and by "them" lumping all other women together as gender-bashing, unfeminine, antimother feminists.


Out of Service


New Schools Official Undaunted by Critics
The new second-in-command of New York City's public schools has emerged as something of a conundrum.
A wealthy banker, he traded retirement for the rough and tumble world of New York City politics.
As a camera-shy dealmaker, he managed to provoke the wrath of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani when he accepted the Schools Chancellor's job offer.
But the conundrums of Barry F. Sullivan, the newly appointed Chief Operations Officer, who has the daunting task of preparing the schools for their tightest financial squeeze in decades, begin to be answered in Chicago, where he spent the 1980's as one of the nation's top bank executives.

McNally, True, but Vaguely Neo-Chekhovian
YOU MIGHT NOT THINK THAT Terrence McNally, the man who wrote "The Ritz," one of the few authentic modern American farces and one with a decidedly gay sensibility, has much in common with Anton Chekhov, but then you haven't yet seen "Love! Valour! Compassion!" The new play, now at the Manhattan Theater Club, is a big, generous, haunted comedy that in its vaguely neo-Chekhovian way is both very funny and filled with intimations of time's passage, of loss and death.
"But," you might say, "Chekhov wasn't gay." To which Buzz Hauser (Nathan Lane), one of the eight homosexual characters in "Love! Valour! Compassion!," would reply, "Who says so?" It's probable that Buzz, who's convinced that virtually everybody is gay and just doesn't admit it, could make a case for Chekhov.
Yet it isn't homosexuality that links the new comedy to "The Cherry Orchard" and "The Seagull." Rather, it's Mr.
McNally's breadth of vision and his ambitious attempt to deal with characters, who are both privileged and threatened, in a way that ignores self-pity but doesn't ignore the larger world outside.
Though the audience never sees that other world, what's happening in it is very much a part of the life of the play itself.


Last Call for Getting In the Spring Bulbs
WHY do today what can surely be done next week?
This sort of procrastination is typical of gardeners.
Inspired by a few weeks of beautiful mild weather, they postpone those inevitable chores, particularly bulb planting.
But the weeks move along with amazing speed and there are no surer reminders than the early-fading light of fall days and the page-turning of the trusty calendar that winter is on its way.
With it will come frozen soil and snow.
So good gardeners, do be sporting and carry on.
Even a traditional deadline for planting tulips -- Election Day -- is on the horizon.


Taxing Athletic Facilities
MIGHT there be occasions when a resident of a New York State condominium, co-op or homeowner association owes sales tax on monthly charges?
The possibility has created an uproar among board members, managing agents, accountants and lawyers since the New York State Tax Commission issued an advisory opinion last spring warning Shaker Commons, a 98-unit condominium in Colonie, N.Y., that its residents owed sales tax on the portion of its common charges attributable to the operation of its swimming pool and tennis courts.


A Community Is Wary After A Kidnapping
Worried residents of Fairfax County, Va., are bolstering home security measures while the police search for leads in the case of a 6-year-old boy kidnapped from his bedroom, assaulted and abandoned nearly 30 miles from his home early Thursday, the police said.
A police spokesman, Warren Carmichael, said the kindergartner was taken from his bedroom sometime before 2:30 A.M. while his parents slept nearby.
The boy's father discovered him missing and notified the police about 3 A.M.
The home showed no signs of forced entry, Mr.
Carmichael said.

Players Are Talking Rival United League Seriously, Agents Say
With the price of franchises pegged in the area of $5 million, the United Baseball League should have little trouble finding owners for their projected 10 franchises.
That's a bargain-basement rate compared with the $150 million that major league baseball will probably charge the people from Phoenix and St.
Petersburg, Fla., to get into that exclusive club.
More difficult for the fledgling league will be the seduction of major league players into their teams' uniforms, and a still more arduous task will most likely be the effort to induce 10 cities to build stadiums in return for 15 percent equity in the team and a 15 percent share of the pretax profits.


Last Call for Getting In the Spring Bulbs
WHY do today what can surely be done next week?
This sort of procrastination is typical of gardeners.
Inspired by a few weeks of beautiful mild weather, they postpone those inevitable chores, particularly bulb planting.
But the weeks move along with amazing speed and there are no surer reminders than the early-fading light of fall days and the page-turning of the trusty calendar that winter is on its way.
With it will come frozen soil and snow.
So good gardeners, do be sporting and carry on.
Even a traditional deadline for planting tulips -- Election Day -- is on the horizon.


The Governor's Race: What's in It for Us?
A glossy red, white and blue pamphlet prepared by the State Democratic Committee arrived last week in thousands of New York City mailboxes.
It carried a simple message: If George E. Pataki is elected Governor, "Your rent-stabilized or rent-controlled apartment is history."
"When tenant protections are ended, how many minutes will your landlord wait to call?" the brochure went on.
"And if you can't afford your new rent, how long will he give you to pack your bags?"


A Law, A Legacy And Indian Art
THE DRUMS, PIPES AND melodic chants heard in lower Manhattan last week enlivened the opening of the George Gustav Heye Center of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian at the Alexander Hamilton United States Custom House.
Prior to the festivities, many of the collectors and dealers who had come to see the museum bought, albeit spottily, at three auctions, which helped revive the lackluster market for beaded shirts, Navajo blankets, Eskimo carvings, and other American Indian art and artifacts.
Wherever enthusiasts of Indian art gathered, discussions raged over the impact of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act on collecting.
The law, passed in 1990, requires the return of certain Indian cultural property acquired by Federally financed museums, though not those owned by dealers, collectors and private institutions.
And some Indians, eager to expand the scope of the law, continue to protest the sale of certain tribal objects.

World Bank Loans
To the Editor:
Apart from their flawed economic logic, John Cavanagh and Sarah Anderson have employed questionable arithmetic in contending that International Monetary Fund and World Bank adjustment loans to developing countries have reduced United States exports by $1 billion a year ("For U.S., Aid Banks Aren't Too Helpful," Viewpoints, Oct. 2).


Battle Lines Form as Dublin Prepares to Ease an Abortion Law
News this week of the Government's intention to liberalize one of Ireland's highly restrictive anti-abortion laws has renewed national debate on abortion in this predominantly Roman Catholic country.
The Minister of Health, Brendan Howlin, said the law that prohibits the distribution of information about abortion clinics in other countries would be amended in legislation to be considered by the Cabinet of Prime Minister Albert Reynolds next week.
After expected approval by the Cabinet, the measure is to be debated in the Parliament, where there are many vehement opponents of liberalization.

Ghost of Lawyers Past
To the Editor:
Your Oct. 30 news article about Rodney G. King's lawyers' $4.4 million bill tests the proverb "The lawyer never dieth a beggar."


That CD or Tape Just May Be a Fake
OVER THE SUMMER THE shaky relations between China and the United States got another jolt.
Oddly enough, the fracas is about audio and video.
Back in June the Clinton Administration threatened trade sanctions within six months if the Chinese Government didn't take action against factories churning out pirate copies of American CD's.
China is a major source of forged CD's, with an output of about 75 million disks a year.
That undercuts American record companies in the world market and adds about $1 billion to America's foreign trade deficit.


Tenants Praise Inspection Blitz After Charging Slumlord Abuse
Inspectors from several city agencies descended on West 22d Street throughout this week in a crackdown on violations at buildings whose tenants say they are being abused by a pair of slumlords.
Emergency repairs were ordered for a gas leak at 327-329 West 22d and for inoperative fire sprinklers at No. 412, city officials said.
Stop-work orders were issued on renovations at 329-331 that were being done without a permit.
And violations were found at several buildings.


STEVE GUNDERSON
In Chandler Burr's article on Congressman Steve Gunderson, Newt Gingrich talks a great deal about how tolerant he is of gays in the Republican Party ("Congressman (R), Wisconsin. Fiscal Conservative, Social Moderate. Gay," Oct. 16).
Any impression one might draw that Gingrich is supportive of fair treatment for gay men and lesbians is wholly inaccurate.
In fact, his record has been one of consistent and vigorous opposition to treating gay men and lesbians fairly.
If his views on gay and lesbian rights are the Republican big tent, it is hard to imagine how microscopic the small one is.

Great Minds Think . . .
To the Editor:
In her essay on the contemporary relevance of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya"  [ "Why 'Vanya,' and Why Now?," Oct. 16 ] , Patricia Bosworth attributes to the critic Harold Clurman the quote "Life is a tragedy for those who feel, a comedy for those who think." This quote is a particular favorite of mine and originated with Horace Walpole, who said: "This world is a comedy to those that think, a tragedy to those that feel."  MILLICENT JENSEN  St.

Lopez, Osborne, Ali: Ah, What a Banquet
Felipe Lopez of St.
John's flew out of town on a school night ("He needs another award?" groused his old high school teacher. "He should be home with his books.") Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne flew out of town on a practice night (he stayed only 20 minutes before he flew home).
And Muhammad Ali, once stripped of his title for refusing to be drafted, was awarded an honorary doctorate for public service.
Thus the reform wing of mainstream sports, better known as the Center for the Study of Sport in Society, celebrated its 10th year as part of Northeastern University last Wednesday night with a banquet for 700 in Boston.
The lesson was athletically clear; hang tough long enough, superstars will put you on the scoreboard.


On the Trail
Developments yesterday in campaigns in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. NEW YORK
Cuomo -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Public Advocate Mark J. Green, the Republican and Democrat who have been rivals since both took office in January, stood together to attack the Republican candidate for governor, George E. Pataki, and to stress his ties to United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
Mr.
Giuliani and Mr.
Green, who lost a bid to unseat Mr.
D'Amato in 1986, said a victory by Mr.
Pataki would turn the state government into what the Mayor called "a government of D'Amato, for D'Amato and by D'Amato."


WESTCHESTER GUIDE
A DEHNER TRIBUTE
The death of Dorothy Dehner last September at the age of 92 has altered the purpose of the exhibition at the Station Gallery in Katonah of her sculptures and drawings from the 1950's to the present.
It has become a posthumous tribute to the American artist rather than a follow-up to the gallery's Dehner exhibition of 1993.
The show opens today and will continue through Dec. 4.
Influenced heavily by the Fauves, Cubists and German Expressionists of the 1920's, Dehner drew and painted until the 1950's, when she began to sculpture as well.
The show contains line drawings, watercolors, gouaches and bronzes, varying in scale and ranging in style from the figurative to the abstract.
During the 50's she divorced her husband, the sculptor David Smith, and began achieving a reputation for herself.
The gallery director, Vincent Baldassano, said: "Dehner is often analyzed in terms of her 25-year marriage to Smith, during which she nurtured him intellectually and artistically. His effect on her life and art, however, is variously described as competitive, intimidating and stifling."
The gallery, at 43 Katonah Avenue, is open Thursdays through Sundays from noon to 5 P.M.
For more information, call 232-7529.
FIBER FAIR
Fiber artists will be on hand in profusion and would-be spinners, weavers, knitters and crocheters should be intrigued with the possibilities displayed on Saturday when the Westchester Knitting Guild, the Handweavers Guild of Westchester and the Center for Fiber Arts at Marymount College get together for a Fiber Fair on the Tarrytown campus from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.
The sponsoring nonprofit groups are dedicated to promoting the use of fleece, cotton, wool, silk and flax in creative ways, and they encourage people to use natural fibers in weaving.
Visitors who come dressed in their own fibre creations will receive gifts, and those who donate a knitted or woven cap to a drive called Caps for Kids will get a free raffle ticket.
Throughout the day there will be classes for beginners and experienced practitioners, children, teenagers and adults, in knitting, spinning, weaving, dyeing, crocheting, pattern charting and machine knitting.
Yarn, fleece, flax, silk, buttons, books, videos and all kinds of knitting, spinning and weaving equipment will be on sale.
The college cafeteria will be open for lunch, and all events will be held in Rita Hall, including the raffle, a bake sale and a fiber fashion show.
Admission will be $5, $2 for children.
The college is at 100 Marymount Avenue.
Call 322-1627 for more information.
WATERSCAPING

William Niering talking about "In Harmony With Nature."
General admission will be $89 for the day, covering refreshments, a box lunch, handouts and a program book.
College students with identification can attend for $58, excluding the box lunch.
To register or for information, call (718) 817-8747 or (718) 817-8720.
Related workshops will be led by local experts at the Botanical Garden through November at additional cost.
Included are pond construction; fountains, streams and waterfalls and residential poolscaping.
For details, call the same phone numbers.
MORTGAGE MESSAGE
First-time home buyers are invited to attend a free workshop titled "Demystifying the Mortgage" on Saturday from 9:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. at the White Plains Public Library, 100 Martine Avenue.
The many aspects of purchasing a home, obtaining a mortgage and coping with closing costs and procedures will be discussed by a panel of experts and moderated by Joy Burgos, a pre-purchase counselor at Westchester Residential Opportunities, a nonprofit fair-housing agency.
Ann Seligsohn, the agency's fair housing director, will speak about lending rights; Eileen Halatyn, a Westchester-Putnam realtor, will explain the role of the real estate broker; legal matters about closing a purchase will be addressed by Vincent D'Andrea, a Westchester lawyer, and Nick Papajohn, a mortgage specialist, will talk about getting mortgages.
For details, call 428-4507.
CHESTNUT BLIGHT
A lot of homeowners, parks and probably a few blacksmiths have lost their spreading chestnut trees to chestnut blight since the mid-1960's.
But a stand of 20 healthy American chestnut trees was identified in 1991 at the Lasdon Arboretum in Somers, and the site has become a research center for the American Chestnut Foundation of Morgantown, W.V.
Dr.
Sandra Anagnostakis, a biologist affiliated with the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, has developed a disease-resistant American chestnut tree.
She will preside over a program about her work and the work of the Morgantown foundation and the Lasdon Arboretum in bringing a disease-resistant chestnut tree to market by the year 2000.
The event is on Wednesday at 7 P.M. at the Arboretum, and admission is free.
To reach the Arboretum, in Lasdon Park, take Exit 6 off I-684 and go west on Route 35 four miles to the entrance.
Call 593-2645 for more information.

A Wider European Union
Europe remains economically divided between East and West.
The European Union spent most of that period trying to strengthen links among its West European members instead of reaching out to the post-Communist countries of the East, unnecessarily complicating the Easterners' transition to democratic capitalism.
Thanks mainly to political shifts in key West European countries, a less parochial outlook is taking hold.
Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland are scheduled to be admitted next year.
The most advanced post-Communist economies, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, now have a realistic chance of admission within the next decade.


U.S. Wife's Resolute Quest Shakes Guatemala

Giuliani's Two Battles: Pataki, Then D'Amato
Putting his muscle behind his endorsement of Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has been campaigning the last two weeks as if he were the candidate himself.
But it is hard to distinguish whether he is running against State Senator George E. Pataki or United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
Under the direction of the Cuomo campaign, Mr.
Giuliani has traveled to Rockland County, Long Island and Brooklyn and has made the traditional fly-around of upstate cities.
Strategists for the Governor say that they are using Mr.
Giuliani to appeal in particular to Jews and Italians, in the suburbs and boroughs, who might otherwise consider the Republican line.


HOW MUCH IS HIS FAULT?
Cronin's description of Americans as "lousy followers" does not strike me as apt for people who happily followed Reagan and Bush for 12 years, many of whom lusted after Bush or Perot for four more.


A New Life for an Old Nightclub
The delapidated art moderne building on 160th Street just north of Jamaica Avenue, nestled among mom-and-pop stores and across from a farmers' market, is slated for its fourth incarnation -- as a center to help small local businesses.
The building's story winds into the past, nearly to the turn of the century.
It was constructed in 1907, a neo-classic building with elegant Doric columns.
The current owners believe that it may have been used as a men's club.

Voting Isn't Pretty, but Somebody Has to Do It; Ideas Need Rethinking
To the Editor:
The recent disclosure of a memo by Alice Rivlin, the budget director, that raised the possibility of only the most modest revisions in Social Security caused a shameful display of ducking and covering by Democrats.
Instead of using the opportunity to discuss some real solutions to our deficit and national debt dilemma, they chose not to offend the all-powerful senior citizen voting bloc.


Makeup as Illusion And a Cue for Reality
NAME: Kevyn Aucoin (pronounced oh-COIN).
IDENTITY: Makeup artist.
AGE: 32.
RECENT PROJECTS: Fashion Week spring shows for Isaac Mizrahi, Donna Karan, DKNY, Richard Tyler for Anne Klein, Ralph Lauren, Todd Oldham; author of "The Art of Makeup," (HarperCollins, 1994; $60).
PAST CLIENTS: Tina Turner, Barbra Streisand, Roseanne, Elizabeth Taylor, Diana Ross, Susan Sarandon, Uma Thurman, Audrey Hepburn, Anjelica Huston, and Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Allure magazines.
Q.
How did you get into makeup?
A.
As I was growing up in Louisiana, people told me I was ugly.
I think it was because I was effeminate.
Mine is the story of the ugly duckling, about being able to see that you're not what everyone around you is telling you that you are.
I became interested in the idea of transformation.
Where it stemmed from, for me, was the awareness from a very early age that I was gay, then hearing how awful and evil that was.
Eventually I realized that was all lies, and then I started questioning what else I had heard that wasn't true.
It was a wonderful springboard for me into the world of fashion and beauty, because it kept me from accepting what was and made me see the possibilities of what could be.
Q.
It's interesting that you translated notions of illusion into such a literal metaphor.
A.
It wasn't anything conscious, but I guess it was vicarious, in a way -- the idea that if I can make you look good and feel good about yourself, that makes me feel good about myself because I helped you.
Q.
What's this glamour thing about?
A.
At a certain point in the 80's, there was a no-makeup movement, which was, I think, a political movement.
I always think everything that happens in the fashion world is based on politics.
In the 80's, people in the fashion world were losing their friends to AIDS, they were watching gay and lesbian civil rights being destroyed, there was an enormous amount of sexism going on.
And the fashion business reacted in several ways.
During the beginning of the Reagan years, there was a real white-male view of women as Barbie dolls -- very glamorous, and voluptuous.
So in the early 80's there was a lot of Big.
Big hair, big makeup, big breasts.
Then, suddenly, came the no-makeup movement.
What it meant politically was that women don't have to wear makeup to be accepted.
It's O.K. for women to be bare-faced.
And not only is it O.K., it's good, it's a great look.
And it was important to expand the boundaries of what we considered acceptable.
Now, there's a return to glamour because even the no-makeup look was becoming oppressive.
Q.
So the fashion world presents us with an extreme?
A.
Always.
No one's going to go home and do their makeup the way we do it for a magazine.
But you can go off and say "Oh, purple's the message." It's not about saying, "Go wear this to go out tonight," but rather: "Oh, yellow! Color! I'll put a little spring into it." Q. Who creates trends, and how?
A.
There's a really small group of people that can make a big difference.
It's not like some little committee, and it keeps changing, but it's a group of people who love women and feel a great respect for women, and most of them have their finger on the pulse of what's going on, in terms of what affects their lives.
Manipulation is not part of the inspiration.
It's the desire to open up doors and make things more acceptable.
That's where Kristin McMenamy and Kate Moss come in.
That's where Roshumba comes in, or Naomi Campbell, who has more traditional black features than most of the black models before her.
When Steven Meisel brings Kristin to the American public and says, "This is beauty, and it's not the typical all-American blonde," it's because Steven fights for it that America wakes up.
Like Barbra Streisand.
Those are the people I love and adore, because they are breaking the boundaries and creating more acceptance for everyone.
Q.
What are some of the runway makeup trends that are new and interesting?
A.
I'll tell you what I think is the most old-fashioned: a ton of foundation.
I think what's new is someone with dark, smoky eyes -- yet you can see their skin -- and glossy lips.
Not so long ago, there was a return to the 70's, but it was done very literally, copied from a 70's magazine, without any modern take on it, which to me is uninspiring.
What I'm here for, as a makeup artist, is to present women with options.
A new option is to be inspired by a look from the past, and then make it modern.
Q.
Who's doing the most innovative makeup nowadays?
A.
The Japanese are light-years ahead of everyone else when it comes to formulating makeup.
It's scary to me that American companies have no clue, compared to the Japanese.
For the Japanese it's more of an art.
For American companies it's about how much something will sell.
Q.
What looks do you like?
A.
The whole range, from a woman who's completely dressed up, has her hair pulled back, let's say, and wears a velvet coat, huge earrings and no makeup, except for some sort of oil in her face (I love skin that looks glowing like that).
Women with a lot of makeup on also catch my eye.
I love the extremes.
It's fascinating to see that someone's far up on either end of the spectrum.
It says they're not afraid of being different.
And those are the people I gravitate toward, because that's me.
Q.
Where do your ideas come from?
A.
I get a lot from children.
I look at my niece -- her little cherub cheeks, rosy lips, long blond eyelashes, dark eyebrows -- and I think: "That's it! That's the makeup for the show!"
It's not at all about making women look just like little girls, either.
It's just that my niece inspired me, just like I get ideas from old movies I watch.
Q.
Where do fashion and beauty go now?
A.
That depends on what happens in politics.


CONTROL IN SENATE NEAR G.O.P. GRASP AS RACES WIND UP
One of the closest, nastiest and perhaps most consequential off-year set of Senate campaigns in decades is clattering to an end in the same volatile climate of voter unrest, partisan invective and incumbent anxiety with which it began.
After months of state-by-state drama punctuated by increasingly mean and shallow advertisements, and after a record-breaking total of more than $200 million in Senate campaign spending, the central question remains: Can Republicans pick up the seven seats they need to control the chamber?


Seething With Humorous Discontent
THE Gallery at Mercer County Community College began in 1991 by focusing on artists from the area.
Now, under the direction of Henry Hose, it is reaching out like a telephone company -- to the rest of the state and beyond, if the current show, "The Red Figure," is any indication.
A lot is going on in this show, not all of it red or, for that matter, related to the figure, and the organizer, John Goodyear, who teaches art at the Mason Gross School at Rutgers, makes it clear from the outset that the ride will not be easy.
For example, he opens his brief introduction with a quote, "We are the ancients," attributing it to Francis Bacon.
He does not say whether he means the 20th-century Irish painter or the 16th-century English philosopher.
No matter; either one could have made the remark.

Lone Prairie (0-44) Is Buried
Going into today's game against Tarleton (Texas) State, the Prairie View A&amp;M Panthers were staring at a desolate prospect; tying the Division I-AA record for most consecutive losses.
The leader in football futility in their bracket is Columbia, which set the mark of 44 straight games from 1983 to 1988.
Prairie View was 0-8 this season, but this game was the one on the schedule they hoped might end that streak: Tarleton was a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II school, a notch below Prairie View's status; it was homecoming and a full house of 6,000 was on hand in Blackshear Stadium here, about 45 miles northwest of Houston.
And, to add a little glamour to the event, a new scoreboard had just been installed.

Computers As Wasters Of Energy
WHEN college campuses try to become more "green," they often start recycling and using biodegradable materials.
But the State University of New York at Buffalo's, conservation campaign has targeted the personal computer.
Computers cause the fastest-growing use of electricity on campus, and the university's facilities department decided to try to break the bad energy habits computer users develop.


Bosnian Shift: Are the Serbs Now on the Run?
A long stalemate in the Bosnian war has abruptly given way to a flurry of victories by Muslim-led Government forces that pose a central question: Is the Bosnian Serb army on the run?
The question would have been unthinkable two weeks ago, when the superiority of the Bosnian Serbs in artillery, tanks and military organization seemed as impregnable as throughout the previously one-sided 31-month-old war.


Cold War Without End
HARALD RAUDSEPP'S daily journey into his past is a ritual unmarred by age, frailty and the upheavals of history.
Ninety-one years old now, he walks with a tremulous gait, and he cannot converse without a hearing aid.
But he still puts on a starched suit every morning and rides the subway to midtown Manhattan, clutching typewritten testaments to a former life.
Mr.
Raudsepp is editor of The Free Estonian Word, a weekly newspaper for the estimated 10,000 Estonians in and around New York.
He arrived here in 1949, after years of hiding from the K.G.B. in Soviet-occupied Estonia.
The memories linger with haunting clarity.


Voters to Fill 7 Judicial Slots
ALTHOUGH the gubernatorial race and a few hotly contested legislative posts are likely to attract the most attention on Election Day Tuesday, voters will also fill seats on county and state judicial benches.
There are four spots for the County Court, where judges primarily handle felony criminal cases and are elected to serve 10-year terms at a yearly salary of $113,000.


The Nation; The Boom in Jails Is Locking Up Lots of Loot
TWO of the dominant sentiments in America today are the desire to get tough on criminals and the desire to reduce government spending.
Yet these two impulses are clashing across the nation as the United States finds itself in the midst of an unparalleled prison building boom.
Spurred by public anger over persistent crime, the Federal Government and the states have been beefing up police forces, imposing tougher sentences and restricting parole.
As a result, the nation's inmate population has been climbing at a rate of more than 900 new prisoners a week for about the last decade and a half.
The result of this flood of inmates -- which in Federal and state prisons topped one million this summer for the first time -- is a penal system bursting at the seams and scrambling to expand.


At Work; Still In the Dark on Diversity
THOSE whose business it is to ride up in the crow's nest of life, scanning the trend horizons, say there are few instances of a single piece of work having as fast and pervasive an impact as the Hudson Institute's "Work Force 2000: Work and Workers for the 21st Century."
The 1987 report projected an increasingly diverse American labor force, that is one increasingly composed of women, members of minority groups and other alternatives to the traditional white, male breadwinner.
A certain number of forward-looking companies immediately grasped the implications of employing a work force that might -- but might not -- arrive at the office sharing the same social and cultural assumptions.
Diversity, the consulting specialty, was born.


Squash, Anyone?
Squash is constitutionally incapable of letting down its gourd.
Its leathery skin is resolutely protective, able to defy sharp knives and good intentions.
With its dense flesh and hard mien, winter squash must be defeated.
The cook should be reconciled to the effort, to the thwack of a heavy knife and the heat necessary to coax the sweet, nutty nature out of these tough critters.
Squash is the sweetness of cool weather.
It is a vegetable that can perform like fruit, acting as the perfect counterpoint to a rich winter meal or, on its own, as a satisfying soup.

Residue of Fear Remains as Toxins Are Removed
Wind shifts on hot summer days brought the first signs of trouble.
Neighbors in the new subdivision called Timber Stream told each other the odor carried on the breeze was probably nothing more than a bad day at a sewer pumping plant a mile away in Glassboro.
Then pink foamy water bubbled to the surface of the mossy ground in the woods behind their homes and ran in vivid rivulets into a brook that led to Alcyon Lake in the heart of Pitman.
And the smell worsened, burning nostrils and throats.

Hospitals Lose A Vital Sign: Job Security
KERRY MORTH of Waterford started working as a laboratory technician at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London 19 years ago, as a teen-ager just out of high school.
Her husband, Larry, became an engineer and worked at military contracting companies.
"For 8 to 10 years we've lived with the threat of his being unemployed," Mrs.
Morth said.
"He always told me, 'Thank God you're in health care, at least you're secure.' "


The World; Balkan Moral Order Upset As Victim Becomes Victor
ALL moral certainties about the Bosnian war dissolve before the figure of Edina Zec.
A Muslim married to a Serb, she has just fled a sudden advance by the Muslim-led Bosnian army.
Wan with fatigue and worry, she is beyond hope, her soul lacerated by a long war.
Her two brothers fight in the advancing Muslim army; her husband fights in the Serb army confronting them; she stands in the middle, with nowhere to go.
Mrs.
Zec's disarray, brought on by a Bosnian offensive from the Bihac area that overran her home town this week, is nothing unusual.
Almost half of Bosnia's 4.4 million citizens have now been displaced by the war.
But the suffering of this Muslim woman in flight from Muslim-led forces seemed to capture the drained disorientation with which the world took in the Bosnian army's sudden successes over the Serbs around Bihac and in Kupres.


Q. &amp; A.
Leaving Before the Lease Is Up  Q I moved out of an apartment on June 29, 1992, two months before my two-year lease expired.
I had told the management company's leasing agent that for financial reasons I would not be able to continue in the apartment and asked her if I could move into a smaller apartment, which rented for $100 less.
She told me I would not be allowed to move.
I then said I would have no option but to vacate the apartment.

'Dean' Mao's Legacy
In the 1950's and 60's, China mobilized higher education to produce physicists and rocket engineers capable of giving the Communist Party leadership the ultimate in international prestige: a thermonuclear weapon deliverable by intercontinental ballistic missile.
It was an enormous achievement for a nation of peasant farmers led by rough-hewn revolutionaries.
But Mao Zedong, the Communist Party chairman, then decided to tear it all down in the name of permanent revolution and class struggle, and higher education was suspended during the years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.


Lust for Power
PARENTS FROM coast to coast must have read out loud to their children the startling new medical report from Dr.
Li Zhisui, for two decades the personal physician to Mao Zedong.
Mao never let a toothbrush near his teeth, preferring in peasant custom to rinse them daily in green tea.
"A tiger never brushes his teeth," the Great Helmsman loftily explained in resisting his doctor's advice to improve his oral hygiene.
But his teeth looked as if they were coated with green paint.
And one by one they fell out, leaving the tiger almost toothless as he grew old.


To the Barricades of Egalite
Around the world, universities are wrestling with new challenges.
In countries where graduates find they have trained for careers in fields already crowded with professionals, many schools are shifting their emphasis to job training and workplace skills.
Some universities find themselves short of students; others have a surplus.
As institutions of higher learning struggle to find solutions, they are questioning long-held traditions and beliefs about their systems of higher education.
If French students were long thought to spend their time sitting around drinking coffee, smoking Gitanes and discussing philosophy, that image vanished in clouds of tear gas this spring when tens of thousands of them took to the streets to insist on their right to a well-paid job after they completed their studies.
The spark for the violent protests was a new law allowing employers to pay less than the legal minimum wage to those with technical diplomas.
Affected students were outraged.
They said they had been led to higher education by the promise of good jobs, but now were being told that their studies were worthless.
The Government quickly backed off, saying it had merely tried to fight unemployment, which affects one in four French youths between the ages of 18 and 25.
But the dispute helped focus on a more fundamental issue.
What is the purpose of higher education in France today?
Should youths be educated for the sake of being educated or should the emphasis be on preparing them for the workplace?
Traditionally, French universities had a somewhat elitist approach.
But since 1984 everyone who passes the baccalaureat examination at the end of high school has the right to a place at a university.
As a result, the number of students in higher education has jumped from 1.2 million in 1980 to 2 million this year.
Over this period, umemployment has continued to rise.
And since by law university students can study what they like, they are rarely guided toward degrees with better job prospects.
It is only when they complete their studies, then, that many discover they have not been prepared for the job market.
Officials in the Ministry of Higher Education conceded that they were under pressure from university rectors to limit the number of students and even to institute entry exams, and under pressure from the private sector to focus more on practical education.
But they said all efforts to bring change are politically explosive, not only because higher education is now considered a right, but also because universities absorb youths who might otherwise be unemployed.
"It's a critical situation," one ministry official said.
"The student needs to know if he's capable of doing a specific job, but the university doesn't answer that question. It's only posed when the graduate looks for a job and is told, 'You've done three years of law studies, but tens of thousands have done the same thing, so why should we choose you?' People are only now discovering that their blind faith in degrees is a fiction."
As a result, more students are now opting for two-year courses in so-called University Institutes of Technology because graduates from these schools are in greater demand than those from a conventional university.
It is not surprising, then, that they fought the wage cut.
Some experts believe students must change as much as universities.
"No one wants to stop studying before university," said Jean Barrans, a retired professor from Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse.
"Everyone wants a white-collar job and no longer accepts a blue-collar job." Professor Barrans also said that he felt French students had grown passive because only 20 percent work their way through the university.
The rest are supported by their parents or government grants.
"If they had to work to finance their studies, as in the United States," he said, "perhaps things would be better here." ALAN RIDING

The Elves Are in Shirtsleeves


The Executive Computer; Digital's Bid to Cut Networking Costs
IF there is one thing information systems managers have learned, it's that PC's don't come cheap -- even considering today's fire sale price tags.
Maintenance and repairs, as well as the constant need to upgrade software, quickly adds to the cost.
And there is the expense of employee training and dealing with frayed nerves when the computers malfunction, as they inevitably do.
But the folks at Digital Equipment Corporation think they have the answer: When it comes to client-server computing, forget the ordinary personal computer. (Forget also, apparently, the fact that Digital's ordinary PC business is currently the company's fastest growing segment.) With an announcement this week, Digital is hoping to sell the world on its new line of Multia workstations, which have been designed to run in complex client-server environments that use many networking protocols.

What's Fair for Childless Workers?

Are childless workers really entitled to the same benefits as those with children if, as Leslie Lafayette acknowledged in "Fair Play for Childless Workers" (Viewpoints, Oct. 16), it costs a quarter of a million dollars to raise a child?

Wall Street; The Snapple Story . . . a Tale Written in the Margins
FEW growth stories have excited Wall Street as much as that of Snapple, the bottler of iced tea and fruit drinks.
Last week, Snapple stunned its fans twice within an hour.
First it reported that its sales in the important summer season had fallen from the previous year's level.
Then it said it had agreed to be acquired by Quaker Oats for $14 a share, less than half its price early this year, before growth slowed.
The newest quarterly report also shows that gross profit margins -- based upon the sales price less the cost of producing the drink -- are slipping, in part because Snapple is selling more fruit juice, which costs more to make than iced tea.
High margins had been a big part of the Snapple story.

The Quadrangle Becomes a Globe
In the late 1860's, when well-to-do American college students began to spend their junior year abroad and Europe also played host to struggling American artists, wandering expatriates and well-heeled sightseers on the grand tour, the novelist Henry James, who probably understood these footloose Americans better than anyone before or since, was asked to describe them.
"There is but one word to use -- vulgar, vulgar, vulgar!" he rumbled, explaining that he could not abide their ignorance and "perpetual reference of all things to some American standard or precedent."
James's novels took a kinder view, frequently emphasizing a noble quality in American character, but his ill-tempered putdown of his countrymen living abroad (reported by his brother) has echoed down through the decades.
Today, a growing number of American educators believe that the world is too small, too competititve and too dangerous to tolerate the sort of ignorant chauvinism that so provoked James.
The cure, they say, is not small, easy or cheap: American higher education needs to go global.
That does not mean lightheartedly dispatching students to sample cultural bonbons in exotic lands.
To serious-minded American educators, globalization means such things as the presence of large numbers of foreign students and professors on campuses in the United States, so that this fall at New York University's Washington Square campus, for example, more than 30 different languages are being spoken.
It means tens, ultimately hundrends of thousands of American students resident in foreign countries, mastering the local language and culture and -- as with present-day University of California students -- taking a full load of rigorous, faculty-screened courses taught in the native tongue at one of 100 institutions in 32 different countries.
It means internationalizing the curriculum, as in a course in accounting at the University of Michigan School of Business that now includes the study of Japanese regulations permitting the depreciation of assets at many times the rate allowed in the United States.
It means using the latest technology so that sudents at Ramapo College, a small, publicly supported institution in Mahwah, N.J., join in discussions with other students, scholars, artists and officials around the world in 120 teleconferences every year.
"International education is not a new idea, but the times have now conjoined to make it dominant," said L. Jay Oliva, the president of New York University, who has taken a leading role in the movement.
"What's happening here," he continued, "is comparable to what happened in the 19th century when Johns Hopkins University adopted the philosophy of the great German research universities and set the pattern for Harvard, Yale and the others."
The number of American student studying abroad has grown steadily over the last five years and is now at a record high of 72,000, according to the Institute of International Education, the nation's leading educational exchange organization.
This figure is small in comparison with the number of foreign students studying in the United States (438,000, or six times as many), but -- significantly -- the profile of these itinerant American students has changed.
"Typically, they used to be affluent women in their junior year at one of the elite Seven Sisters colleges and they would be studying architecture and French language in Paris," said Richard M. Krasno, president of the institute.
"But today more of them tend to be male, they are less likely to be affluent, they may be interested in business or industry and there's a slight shift away from Europe as their destination."
One conspicuous sign of the growth of international studies is the number of study-abroad programs now being offered.
Ranging from a business and economics course at the university of Hungary in Pecs to another concentrating on language and culture at the leading university in Hanoi, Vietnam, these programs have virtually doubled over the last decade, from 1,857 to 3,701.
Students are eagerly responding.
At an elite institution like Harvard University, 51 percent of the undergraduates participate in at least one work or study program abroad.
At Kalamazoo College, a small, selective liberal arts school in Kalamazoo, Mich., 85 percent of the students study overseas thanks to a private gift of more than $5 million that subsidizes travel and on-site living expenses.
A few American colleges and universities have not been satisfied with merely offering study-abroad programs but have adopted globalism as a fundamental objective for the entire institution.
Speaking for N.Y.U., Mr.
Oliva recently declared: "We plan to enter the next century as the quintessential global university. We will extend to every undergraduate the opportunity to study abroad as part of his or her N.Y.U. education, and we will become a center for global faculty inquiry and a center for worldwide conferences of university leaders."
Robert A. Scott, president of Ramapo College in New Jersey, said his institution aspired to be "a global college" for more practical reasons.
"We believe," he said, "that our graduates likely will either supervise or be supervised by someone of another race, ethnicity or nationality, and that their careers and lives as citizens will be affected by international and intercultural life."
Several American colleges and universities have established campuses in foreign countries so that students may spend extended periods abroad and earn credits readily accepted by employers and graduate schools in the United States.
Webster University in St.
Louis operates wholly owned branches in Geneva, London, Vienna and the Dutch city of Leiden.
Emerson College, a small liberal arts school in Boston, has established a branch in Maastricht, the Netherlands, where students study subjects such as global marketing, communications and advertising.
Some of these branches fare better than others; Japan, for example, has proved especially tricky for American institutions to penetrate.
Of the more than 20 American branches established in Japan in recent years, at least 9 have failed, most recently a Texas A &amp; M branch in Koriyama.
All are said to have been victims of the economic recession in Japan and the unexpected difficulty of recruiting Japanese students.
But if it has not always been easy to attract foreign students to American compuses overseas, foreign students have for years flocked to attend colleges and universities in the United States.
In fact, according to the Department of Commerce, the 438,000 foreign students currently resident in the United States, while only a small fraction of the total enrollment of 14.5 million, have fed a major and all-but-hidden export industry bringing some $6 billion annual to the American economy.
The cohort of foreign students has kept growing steadily at the rate of about 4.5 percent a year for the past two decades.
Quite often, these students become leaders in their societies at home.
Chang-Lin Tien, chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, said he recently attended a state reception in Seoul, South Korea, at which no fewer than seven Cabinet ministers introduced themselves to him as Berkeley graduates.
"That's typical," Chancellor Tien remarked.
"I get the same greetings in Indonesia and Singapore."
The reasons for all of this activity are many.
The first and most important is the rise of the global economy.
Alert, job-oriented students have come to realize that as the world shrinks, many of the best jobs are going to go to college graduates who possess international skills.
For example, after graduating from Wellesley College in 1987, Cynthia Jeffers taught English for two years in Japan under a program run by the Ministry of Education.
She then returned to the United States, entered the Harvard Business School and upon her graduation last June landed a job as an associate in the corporate finance department of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, one of the major brokerage firms on Wall Street.
Her experience in Japan, she said, greatly increased her prospects in the job market.
Another stimulus for globalization is that most financial aid for students has recently become "portable," as college officials like to say.
In the past, vaguely worded Federal statutes authorizing financial aid for college students -- Pell grants, Stafford loans and the like -- made many student advisers hesitant to recommend the use of these grants overseas.
Stephen Cooper, the director of academic programs abroad at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, said that he and a group of associates successfully lobbied Congress to make every form of Federal aid for students applicable for study overseas.
The new explicit language appears in the Higher Education Act of 1992.
"Judging from the number of inquiries I've received from around the country, this is having a big impact," said Professor Cooper.
Still another spur is the development and prevalence of new communications technology that allows educators to leap oceans and cross borders with impunity.
B.
Joseph White, dean of the University of Michigan Business School and a pioneer in the field educators now call "distance learning," has taken the new technology a step further.
Last year Dean White set up a program sponsored by Cathay Pacific, the national airline of Hong Kong, that employs interactive television to link M.B.A. candidates in Hong Kong with professors at Ann Arbor.
"It's actually a complex teaching system because we don't believe we can provide the quality we want with interactive TV alone," said Dean White.
"Consequently, we send our faculty to Hong Kong and bring their students here for face-to-face meetings."
"It's the future," he continued.
"Our pilot project for Cathay Pacific carries with it a vast productivity potential."
Another reason for the growth of interest in globalization is that travel abroad, like hit shows on Broadway, has good word of mouth.
"It's a cliche, but over and over you hear students saying 'It changed my life!' " said Dr.
Krasno.
It is a point confirmed by Corbin Smith, the director of Stanford University's Overseas Study Office.
"When we surveyed the senior class here over the last few years," Mr.
Smith said, "asking what was the most meaningful experience during their undergraduate years, more than 87 percent of those who participated in a Stanford study-abroad program gave that the highest rating."
Not everyone is so enthusiastic.
Roger Kimball, the neoconservative author of "Tenured Radicals," which takes a skeptical look at academia, observes that colleges are "making out like bandits" by collecting full tuition from students and "placing them at a fraction of that cost at overseas institutions."
It is true that the ranks of foreign students in the United States have been swollen not only by the quality of colleges here but also by sharp-eyed admissions officials who have successfully recruited well-heeled foreign students when they were unable to fill their campuses with enough American students able to pay the ever-rising tuition costs.
In fact, unregulated overseas recruitment proved so easy -- and profitable -- that a few years ago unscrupulous hucksters began to recruit foreign students for small community colleges in the United States with misleading promises that after a year or two the student could transfer into Harvard or M.I.T.
Today, some professional organizations have adopted generally effective guidelines and codes of ethics to substantially reduce such misrepresentations.
And some critics, like Mr. Kimball, say there is a great
Continued on Page 31  Continued from Page 26  deal of wishful thinking in the notion that "a semester abroad is going to make one into an internationalist."
Holly M. Carter, dean of the office of educational opportunity programs at Northeastern University, argues that the belief that today's college students are more culturally aware than their predecessors is a comforting myth that ignores "the increase in hate crimes, blatant bigotry and racism on the campuses."
But educational leaders like Mr.
Oliva of N.Y.U. argue that a global perspective is vital to the international community.
"There are at least three factors driving the globalization of education today," he said.
"The first is purely serendipitous: We're on the cusp of a new wave of immigration." (About a million immigrants have come to New York over the past decade, many of whom have attended N.Y.U.)
"Second," he continued, "people realize that the more different environments you move into, the more you learn. Conversely, the more you study with people just like yourself, the less you learn.
"I realize in my own life that I never learned more than when I was overseas for a year and a half. Everything became very vivid. There was no moment when I could let my mind relax. And gradually, I discovered that I could master change."
"And third," Mr.
Oliva said, "the demise of the Soviet Union has made Americans more international than ever. It made us realize that the Soviet Union had been a major force in policing ethnic rivalries. The world got capped under big cloaks. We used to think of the division between Northern and Southern Ireland, and what's happening in Yemen, as anomalies. Now we see them as the rule.
"In the future," he continued, "we probably face 30 to 40 years of instability and border wars like the 19th century, but with one frightening difference -- small nations possessing immensely destructive weapons. So our job in international education is to help provide a global environment in which these ethnic disputes can be handled on the basis of intellectual discourse and debate, not war."
John Markham, director of the University of California's Education Abroad Program, says, "The question I like to ask is: Should the University of California have a foreign policy?"
Most educators acknowledge that the vast majority of American faculty and students are still relatively insular, but they are optimistic that economic forces will prevail.
"The sea change will occur," Dr.
Krasno said, "when the global economy drives corporate leaders to say they want to hire people with foreign language skills and knowledge of foreign cultures, and that all things being equal they will hire them first. That's when the rush will begin."

Stay of Execution for a Dazzling Airline Terminal
PLANES SHOULD STREAK IN drill formation to salute the New York City Council for voting late last month to uphold the landmark designation of the T.W.A. terminal at Kennedy Airport.
And T.W.A. also deserves an aerial loop-the-loop.
While the airline contested the designation of parts of Eero Saarinen's 1962 building, described by Robert A. M. Stern as the "Grand Central of the jet age," it had good reason for doing so.
In addition to sharing J.F.K.'s general state of dilapidation, the T.W.A. terminal is in dire need of design modifications.
Airport security regulations and increased air traffic have placed demands on the building unforeseen 30 years ago.
Happily, these changes will now be supervised by a preservation architect sensitive to Saarinen's design.
The Grand Central comparison is probably stretching it.
While T.W.A. is a powerful piece of expressionistic sculpture, echoing Erich Mendelssohn's dynamic designs of the 1920's, it lacks Grand Central's urban prominence and complexity.
Wallace K. Harrison's main terminal for La Guardia remains the most architecturally distinguished airport building in New York, not least because of the skill with which Harrison knitted the terminal into the context of urban transportation.
With its raised roof canopy tilted toward the sky above the terminal's concave facade, the design deftly merges the highway's horizontal curve with an airplane's upward angle of takeoff.

Brazil's Army Joins Battle In Lawless Rio
The war on crime in Rio, the nation's most lawless city, has taken on a military cast after President Itamar Franco last week ordered Brazil's army to coordinate police efforts.
The President turned to the army after mounting crime made it clear that the government of Rio de Janeiro State had lost control of most of the city's 400 shantytowns.
In recent weeks, patrols by the state police have been met by drug gangs firing automatic rifles and by slum residents burning buses and building street barricades.


Rental Cars
To the Editor: I made a reservation for a car to be picked up at Hertz on East 90th Street in Manhattan on Friday, Oct. 7.
I was given a reservation number.
Friday night, at the rental station, I was surprised to hear that no reservation could be found under my name.
When I presented the reservation number, a phone call was made, and I was told this was a "bogus number." Hertz personnel refused to try to resolve the issue and said I would not be given a car.
Later that evening, I called Hertz's 800 number and was told that my reservation was active and the number valid.
It was only after Hertz in Oklahoma contacted the 90th Street office that a car was made available.


Oct.2-Nov.5: Post Tailhook; West Point Cadets Face Harassment Inquiry
For all the muddled aftermath of Tailhook, the scandal in which partying Navy men mauled and spun female colleagues down a drunken gauntlet, the Army, at least, seems to have learned a lesson.
Within hours of the first complaints from female cadets at West Point last month that they had been manhandled at a pep rally by members of the football team, a down-the-ranks inquiry was ordered by the Superintendent of the United States Military Academy.
He took care, too, to send an early heads-up to his Pentagon and Congressional overseers.
The superintendent, Lieut.
Gen.
Howard D. Graves, has not spent a career at mastering tactics for naught.
And when the results of the inquiry were on his desk -- five football players accused of groping 18 female cadets as they ran past in a regimental "spirit run" of hundreds of cadets -- the general volunteered disclosure of the story to The New York Times along with his plans for three months disciplinary action against football players found guilty.
"We have studied very hard the lessons learned from Tailhook," General Graves emphasized.
Beyond the obvious lesson that service women are not for abusing, Tailhook demonstrated the price to be paid in ranking careers for those later suspected of engaging in official coverup.


Voters Tire Of Abuse Candidates Spewing Out
In normal times, Virginia is a genteel state of horse farms and tobacco fields and politics in moderation.
But these are not normal times.
In the final days of probably the meanest, ugliest race in a mean and ugly election season, Virginia feels like a country at war with itself, where a line is as clearly drawn as the Appomattox, and it has nothing to do with whether people personally like Senator Charles Robb, a Democrat, or his Republican challenger, Oliver L.

Canada Tightens Immigration, Emphasizing Wealth and Skills
Canada, which takes in more people per capita than any other industrialized country, plans to reduce the number of immigrants it will admit next year, put greater emphasis on their skills and wealth, and shift the financial burden for insuring their welfare from taxpayers to the immigrants themselves.
The cutbacks, announced this week, would limit the number of new immigrants to about 200,000 entries in 1995, down from the 230,000 projected for 1994 and 240,138 who arrived in 1993.
That would represent a retreat from an election pledge by the Liberal Government to set immigration at 1 percent of Canada's population of 29 million.

Her mother is a partner in Feldman, Kronfeld &amp; Beatty, a New York law firm.


U.S. Women Make Changes
Two leading American runners, Kim Jones, 36, of Spokane, Wash., and Anne Marie Letko, 25, of Glen Gardner, N.J., said they have learned how to overcome the problems that knocked them out of last year's New York City Marathon, Jones by running with a medicated atomizer to combat her chronic asthma and Letko by controlling her pace and drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration.
Jones, who placed second twice, in 1989 and 1990, and Letko, a strong 10,000-meter specialist who has yet to complete a marathon, are each given a good chance to become the first American woman in 17 years to win the race.

For Visitors to Tibet: A Different Guide
While many travelers visit Tibet to marvel at its cultural wonders and the magnificent scenery of the Himalayas, others go to see for themselves how Tibetans have fared under the notoriously brutal domination of China, which in 1950 overran the land known as "the Roof of the World."
For visitors in that second category, there is now a map to guide them.
The "On This Spot" map was prepared by the International Campaign for Tibet, a Washington-based human rights group, and it points out the sites in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, that Chinese tour guides tend to ignore: forced labor camps and prisons, military installations, even the scenes of massacres.

Bystander Is Wounded in Card Game Fight
A 47-year-old man on his way to work was shot and critically wounded in Times Square yesterday by a gunman who was trying to hit a three-card monte dealer who he believed had cheated him, the police said.
The gunman, identified as Gregory Rivera, 30, of Queens, chased the dealer a short distance from his makeshift card table at about 9:00 P.M., and fired several shots at him with a .25-caliber semiautomatic pistol, striking the victim once, said Officer Bernadette Rainy, a Police Department spokeswoman.
The man may have stopped on the street to watch the game, she said.


The Changing Face of Furniture Making
IF you are in your 30's or 40's, chances are you grew up with Early American furniture bought at Ethan Allen, a company whose name was synonymous with Colonial home furnishings.
In the 1970's, as interest in Early American furniture waned, Ethan Allen sales slid.
Now in response to the changing tastes of a new generation of consumers, the Danbury-based company has cast aside its traditional image and reinvented itself, marketing four separate lines of furniture and accessories.

Sports of the Times; Combating Hand-Checks the World Over
LIKE Winston Churchill, secure in his armored bunker in London during World War II, Rod Thorn hunkered down in a borrowed war room Friday night.
He had better electronics going for him than Churchill ever did.
The Prime Minister mostly had squawking telephones and sputtering radio and clattering wires to tell him what was happening on the different fronts.
Rod Thorn had 12 -- count 'em, 12 -- basketball games flickering on giant television screens.


Penn State Wins, but Not By a Mile
When does a victory become a defeat?
When does the preservation of a perfect season include the possibility that national championship chances have been jeopardized?
When does the losing team celebrate at the end of a game, while the winners, whose lead was never in jeopardy, depart with grim faces?
For Penn State, it all happened on a bizarre, dreary afternoon here today, with a 35-29 victory over Indiana that could create a decisive deficit in the Nittany Lions' quest for a national championship.


SUNDAY: November 6, 1994; Last of the Tobacco Queens
In 1948 the first grand marshal of the National Tobacco Festival, in Richmond, was Frank Sinatra.
In Moultrie, Ga., where tobacco festivals were held until the late 1950's, parade queens wore bathing suits covered with tobacco leaves.
But tobacco companies today, aware of their image as merchants of death, want little to do with festivals.
So while small-town festivals celebrating apples, sorghum syrup, chitlins and even kudzu have proliferated, tobacco, as a festival theme, has become about as popular as asbestos.
The National Tobacco Festival was killed in 1984 by its sponsor, the National Tobacco Council, as part of an effort to avoid public attention.
When Richmond citizens wanted to revive the festival, "they didn't want us to use anything with the name tobacco in it," says Dick McClure, an organizer of the festival's successor, the Southern States Autumn Harvest Grand Illuminated Parade.

To gain entrance to an association brunch you must have that burned-out look.

New Path to Peace in Angola: Clamp Rebels and Hold Tight
Mutilated by one of the world's oldest and ugliest wars, jilted by false peace, Angola is not a land for optimists.
This lush and wretched town in the central highlands, for example, might well scoff at the treaty announced on the radio last Monday, when the Government and the rebels of Jonas Savimbi's Unita movement promised to end their ruinous 19-year conflict.


Work on Columbus Ave. to Slow
For Stewart Schneider, who owns a supermarket and a hardware store on Columbus Avenue between 82d and 83d Streets, the Columbus Avenue reconstruction project has meant a 10 to 15 percent drop in business and store shelves that are understocked because delivery trucks cannot park nearby.
"I'm getting calls from real-estate brokers in my area asking if I want to sell, because they know the situation I'm in," Mr.
Schneider said.

Interning For Pleasure And Profit
WHO would want a job that may offer no pay, will last only a few weeks and more than likely mean a lot of drudge work?
College students, of course, who clamor for the chance to land an internship.
Students know that working as an intern can provide contacts and all-important experience in their chosen fields.
And last year, 26 percent of graduates hired by companies had worked as interns, compared with 9 percent the year before.


The Campaigner in Chief Alternately Defends His Record and Looks Ahead
"Forward!" President Clinton has exhorted all week, settling on a slogan for an election in which he contends that voters face a fundamental choice.
It is Democrats who are looking to the future, he says, while Republicans are bent on throwing the nation into reverse.
But in these final campaign days of rallies and relentless interviews, Mr.
Clinton has collided time and again with the view that it is his Presidency that has run off the rails.
His return to the political trail this week, 21 months into his term, has underscored the troubles he faces in campaigning as an incumbent.


Lost in Woods? It's Part of Game
THINK you could find your way around a forest with just a compass and a map?
Beyond that, would you want to?
Well, lots of other people do -- in the form of a sport called orienteering, which has been popular for years in Scandinavian countries and is making significant inroads, so to speak, among outdoorsy, granola-crunching Americans.
But it has yet to take much of a hold in the New York area.


Oct.2-Nov.5; Writer Wins a Bittersweet Verdict
As the jury filed into Judge Eugene F. Lynch's courtroom in San Francisco last week, Janet Malcolm sat quietly.
Her husband wrapped his arm reassuringly around her shoulders, which for the past decade have borne the weight of a $7 million libel suit brought by Jeffrey M. Masson, a Bay Area psychoanalyst she once profiled in The New Yorker.
But as the court clerk read the verdict, the pressure on those shoulders lifted.
The jury found that in her pair of 1983 articles on Mr.
Masson's rise and fall at the Sigmund Freud Archive in London, Ms.
Malcolm had falsely attributed two of five disputed quotations to Mr.
Masson, and that one of those was defamatory.
But she had not acted either willfully or recklessly, the jury concluded, meaning that Mr.
Masson had not been libeled.


Gasoline Testing Shows Compliance
MOTORISTS in the county can be reasonably confident that they are getting what they pay for at the gas pump, because of a statewide gasoline-testing program that began in 1991.
From September to December 1991, 8 percent of gasoline samples taken in the county -- 34 of 435 -- failed to deliver the octane level advertised by the stations.
Through Oct. 20 of this year, less than 1 percent of samples taken -- 4 out of 438 -- failed.
To date, the program has taken 2,277 gas samples over three years, with 58, or 2.55 percent, failing to live up to their labeling.


Anne L. Kellogg And John J. Carr
Anne Lyster Kellogg, the daughter of Margaret and Gordon S. Kellogg of Port Washington, L.I., was married there yesterday at St.
Stephen's Episcopal Church to John Joseph Carr, a son of Agnes and Thomas W. Carr, also of Port Washington.
The Rev.
Kurt Von Roeschlaub, an Episcopal priest, performed the ceremony, and Msgr.
James Murray, a cousin of the bridegroom's father, took part in it.
The bride, 35, is keeping her name.
She graduated from Quinnipiac College and is an editorial supervisor at Klemtner Advertising in New York.
Her father retired as a systems analyst in White Plains for the International Business Machines Corporation.
Her mother, also retired, was an administrative assistant at St.
Stephen's.

She graduated from Duke University.


Lead Poisoning, the Classless Stalker
YVONNE CROOKS remembers how her youngest son, 2-year-old Karon, learned to pull himself up to the living room window and peer out at the world.
If the window was ajar, the curly-haired toddler with dark brown eyes nudged it open even farther and ran a yellow toy car back and forth along the sill.
Especially when he was teething, the boy chewed on the sill, and often he put the car to his mouth.
Blood tests, taken last spring during a routine physical checkup at the local public health clinic, showed that Karon had dangerously elevated levels of lead in his body.
That was about the time that Mrs.
Crooks and her husband, Cosmo, an auto mechanic, noticed changing behavior in their son.


Senate Race Makes Virginians Militant
In the final days of probably the meanest, ugliest race in a mean and ugly election season, Virginia feels like a country at war with itself, and it has nothing to do with whether people personally like Senator Charles Robb, or his challenger, Oliver L. North.
By now, most people say, they are sick of both.

In America; The Doom Mongers
The Republicans in Washington in the spring and summer of 1993 predicted catastrophe.
President Clinton, in office only a few months, was struggling to pass his deficit reduction plan.
Nowhere could he find a Republican, not one -- not in the House and not in the Senate -- who would vote for it.

Her mother, a statistician, retired as the Head of Human Nutrition and Home Economics at the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington.
Her father was a professor of philosophy and education at City College.


THE 1994 CAMPAIGN In a Fury of Campaigning, Candidates Pursue Last-Minute Votes; Sending Signals to Voters
Endorsing B. Thomas Golisano in the governor's race, Ross Perot said support for the independent would be "a tangible signal to Albany and Washington." He also campaigned with Senator Frank R. Lautenberg in New Jersey.

Social Security: The Issue They Chose To Ignore
PESSIMISM may be this year's most important public attitude.
And that will be true whether or not it leads voters to punish the Democrats.
The belief that the future is going to be worse than the present has historically been a negative for the stock market, and one market indicator, based on the Conference Board's consumer confidence index, is close to giving its first sell signal since shortly before the 1987 crash.


HOW MUCH IS HIS FAULT?
When politicians get in trouble, they frequently blame "cynicism" for the voters' loss of faith in them.
On the contrary, we aren't cynical enough.
We remain an immature nation, with a correspondingly naive political culture, one in which too many unrealistic hopes are pinned on self-serving office seekers.
If we were able to see through the promises, we'd spare ourselves a lot of unhappiness.
We'd also be less inclined to tell pollsters how disappointed we are in whomever it is we elected and so would more likely get what we really want (like a good health care bill).
BARRY EDELSON Baldwin, L.I.


Beyond The Calisthenics
To the Editor:
How disappointing that so many of the commentators Guy Garcia cites in his article on sex in the movies  [ "Women = Coy Banter, Men = Nude Blondes," Oct. 23 ]  reiterate such hackneyed cliches and reinforce such hoary stereotypes about women and men!


STEVE GUNDERSON
Burr tells us that Steve Gunderson is gay and has been in the same relationship for 11 years.
We see a photo of Gunderson, with his male partner, and a formal portrait of him wearing a wedding band (or facsimile thereof).
In short, you make him look like someone gays should be delighted to have in Congress.
Then you tell us that Gunderson is not good enough to satisfy some gay activists, without mentioning that he refuses to sign as a sponsor either of the two gay civil rights bills before Congress.
One of the bills may be too liberal for a political moderate.
The other definitely is not.


Window and Door Open to Interpretation
To passers-by, Edwin Peters's ground-floor apartment at 307 West 111th Street stands out for what it has in the windows.
There are pictures of former Mayor David N. Dinkins, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and former President John F. Kennedy; religious statues; large flowerpots filled with plastic plants; African figurines and a red teakettle.
But to neighbors in the city-owned building, the apartment is also well-known for its stream of loud, late-night visitors.
They have easy access, too, since his door is often ajar, and the building is missing both front doors.


Candlelight Isn't Enough
To the Editor:
What is glaring to me in Guy Garcia's article is the complete lack of acknowledgment on the part of anyone that American women have not been allowed to see in mainstream American culture their own object of heterosexual desire: the male body.


Audrey L. Sorgen and Scott D. Sanders
Audrey Lynn Sorgen, a daughter of Howard and Roberta Sorgen of Dix Hills, L.I., was married last evening to Scott David Sanders, the son of Michael and Roberta Sanders of West Bloomfield, Mich.
Rabbi Gabriel Maza officiated at the Garden City (L.I.) Hotel.
Mrs.
Sanders, 25, is a candidate for a Ph.D. degree in health psychology at Yeshiva University.
She and her husband graduated from the University of Michigan.
Her father is a senior vice president and the managing director of global systems and technology at Merrill Lynch &amp; Company in New York.


Milan
Richard Wagner's somber "Die Walkure," which will open the 1994-95 season of the Teatro alla Scala on Dec. 7, may not be quite in tune with the vivacious melody of Milan life, but no matter.
Whatever the program, the annual opening of Italy's premier opera house on the feast of St.
Ambrose, the heavenly patron of this dynamic and creative metropolis, is always a civic apotheosis.
It draws top national and local officials, politicians and some of the richest and most stylish members of Milan society, while the music aficionados are mostly in the less expensive galleries.


Political Turmoil Distracts Poland as NATO Decisions Loom
Poland's increasingly chaotic political situation is more confused than ever these days.
Embarrassing the Government at an important juncture in its foreign policy, Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski announced last week that he would resign because his reputation had been impugned by a fellow Cabinet member.


Putting Dave Brown Under a Microscope
George Henshaw, the Giants' offensive coordinator, has become something of a surrogate father to quarterback Dave Brown.
He has taught him to be poised and to be strong when things don't go right.
As times have turned tough for Brown and the 3-5 Giants, Henshaw has been there to offer help.
He knows Brown well.
But there are people who may know Brown better.
They are the players Brown competes against.
The linebackers who sit in darkened rooms watching more film than Siskel and Ebert.
The defensive backs who look to see what Brown does in certain formations, who want to know what he has for breakfast, how fast he is and whether he likes the Knicks or the Nets.


On Sunday; Feud, Betrayal, Italian Players: Electoral Verdi
THIRTY years ago, when he first politicked in Italian on the avenues of Bensonhurst as a "new wave" postwar Sicilian immigrant, Arnaldo A. Ferraro found his older predecessors complacent in their storefront social clubs and wary of the strange treacheries of mainstream New York politics.
So it is with considerable joy that even with his own State Senate candidacy in some doubt this year, Mr.
Ferraro is counting the engrossing gubernatorial campaign now before us as a veritable crescendo of progress in the Italian-American community's demonstration of its heft in American politics.
"And I don't think Giuliani really carries that much clout in crossing over to Cuomo," says Mr.
Ferraro, getting right to what is the fun part of the campaign for most of us, the aggressive Republican Mayor's shock endorsement of the proud Democratic Governor, and the dilemma this might pose for the many Italian-American Republicans in the Brooklyn precincts of Mr.
Ferraro and beyond.
"Don't forget, for anyone seeking an ethnic factor, well, there's also a D'Amato and a Molinari endorsing Pataki. And I do remind such voters -- even as I disagree with the idea of ethnic voting -- that Pataki is half-Italian."


THE ANGER: EVER DEEPER
It has become a cliche of TV ads for politicians to be pictured in color photographs, smiling, while their opponents are shown in harsh black and white.
In your issue on politics, the article about Kathleen Brown, a Democrat, is accompanied by color photographs, as are the articles about the gay Republican Congressman, Steve Gunderson, and the Democrat Congressman, Dan Rostenkowski.


Saint


Gina Ravosa, Christopher Miller
Gina Ravosa, the marketing representative for the American Red Cross in Greater New York, was married yesterday to Christopher Alan Miller, a recruiter for the Dale Cunningham Agency, employment recruiters in New York.

Her father is the composer-in-residence at the Dalton School in New York and a songwriter for the PBS program "Shining Time Station."


2 Killed as Biplane Dives Into Great South Bay
A father and his son died today when their 1940 Stearman biplane nose-dived into the Great South Bay as the two men were performing aerial stunts, the Suffolk County police said.
They said Neale Maccarn, 64, and his son Kenneth, 28, were doing acrobatics -- turns, rollovers and loops -- in their World War II-vintage open-cockpit plane at about 2 P.M. when it plummeted into the water a quarter mile from the town of Sayville.


An 'America-First' Challenger Is Resonating, in English Only
The way Frank Borzellieri sees it, he is the true believer in conservatism.
He accuses Anthony Seminerio -- a staunch supporter of the death penalty who has voted against an expansion of gay rights and who once introduced legislation proposing that Queens secede from New York City -- of being soft.
Mr.
Borzellieri, the Republican challenger for the State Assembly seat in the borough's 38th district, does not compromise on the themes that make up his campaign: eliminating foreign languages from government-issued documents and banning from public schools books he considered anti-American, like biographies of Martin Luther King Jr.


HOW MUCH IS HIS FAULT?
As a population mostly of followers who are, as Thomas E. Cronin tactfully persuades us, lousy at it, let us consider what effective followers might look like ("How Much Is His Fault?" Oct. 16).
We might agree that they would have convictions built upon critical reasoning and authentic emotions; they would take responsibility for these convictions, articulate and defend them and be willing to change them.
They would be concerned about the diversity of others.
They would not be blindly compliant but discerning and selective.
They would appreciate mastery in others and would try to develop their own form of mastery.


Commercial Property/Coffee Bars; Landlords Savor the Smell of Coffee Bars
THERE'S a building on Madison Avenue in the 40's whose owners tell a decidedly non-90's tale.
A few months ago they put a 2,100-square-foot space on the market for an annual rent of $60 a foot, figuring that this would be a starting point for negotiations.
That it was.
A couple of bids trickled in at $60.
Then a coffee house, fearing that other tenants might grab the space, offered $65.
A rival coffee house promptly offered $70.
The rival will get the space -- provided a third coffee house does not bid even more.


The Young Man of Bad Boy
FOR Sean Combs, a. k. a.
Puff Daddy, it was a long, long weekend.
But not atypical.
The president of Bad Boy Entertainment moves around a lot.
There he was on Friday night at Nell's restaurant on West 14th Street, on a video shoot for the Notorious B.I.G., one of his rap artists.
Then it was off to Philadelphia for a party.
On Saturday, he was back at a posh house in Westbury, L.I., to work on another B.I.G. video.
In the wee hours of Sunday morning, it was finally finished.
"I'll sleep for like an hour," he said.
Up again, he was off to produce another video; this time for the singer Mary J. Blige, back in Manhattan at 145th Street and Riverside Drive.
"Our motto is, sleep is forbidden -- when most are sleeping, we are working," says Mr.
Combs, trotting out his energy and youth to explain why he is a rising young producer.


The Prime Purpose Of Making a Budget
To the Editor:
Although your "Keeping Budgets Honest" on Oct. 16 was certainly a step in the right direction, it did not get to the true heart of the budget process.
The primary purpose of the budget process is not to accommodate outsiders by providing for adequate cash reserves, but rather to help shareholders keep their costs from escalating.

Connecticut Q&amp;A: David J. Carol; Adding More (and Faster) Rail Service
AMTRAK'S vice president for high-speed rail, David J. Carol, is charged with overseeing a $3 billion, 16-year improvement project for the 231-mile stretch of railroad that makes up the Northeast corridor between Boston and Washington, D.C.
The Northeast corridor is one of the busiest in the Amtrak system, with 1,150 trains a day carrying 220 million passengers a year.


The World: Slapstick at the C.I.A.; Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Tosspot
IF it weren't so tragic, the 116-page Senate report published last week, "An Assessment of the Aldrich H. Ames Espionage Case and Its Implications for U.S. Intelligence," would have potential as a new art form: the absurdist slapstick spy thriller.
Act I: Rome, 1986 to 1989.
The story thus far: Rick Ames, a career Central Intelligence Agency officer, has sold the Soviets the keys to the C.I.A.'s kingdom, turning over the inside dope on all its important operations aimed at Moscow and the names of all the C.I.A.'s important Soviet agents.
At least 10 of the agents are executed.


Wall Street; Muriel Siebert's Declaration of War
NO one has ever accused Muriel Siebert, president of the discount brokerage firm that bears her name, of being overly subtle.
The first female member of the New York Stock Exchange, it was she who lobbied in 1987 to get a ladies' room installed on the seventh floor of the Big Board -- site of the luncheon club she regularly frequented.
Her ploy back then: to warn the exchange's chairman that if she didn't see a ladies' room on the floor by her 20th anniversary as a member in December 1987, she would arrange for a Port-o-San to be delivered to the board of directors.


The Guests Were Divine, Nostalgic, Off the Rails
DOWNTOWN -- "Fashion Week is Seventh Avenue's High Holidays," said Fern Mallis, the executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America.
Like a very well-dressed president of a local Hadassah chapter, she was looking down on Nov. 2 at a congregation of fashion worshipers from what once was the bimah, or platform, of a former synagogue on the Lower East Side.
A splashy party for the British design label Ghost was in progress.
Behind her, bartenders were serving vodka martinis from an alcove that once held the Torah scrolls of the synagogue (which was built in 1850 and has been a nonprofit gallery and concert hall called the Angel Orensanz Foundation since 1987).


A Romanian Director Tells A Tale of Ethnic Madness
Lucian Pintilie couldn't simply bask in the glow of the reception for his film "An Unforgettable Summer" at the Telluride Film Festival, in Colorado, in September.
The Romanian film maker was incredulous that he couldn't smoke indoors.
For someone who had just made a film about tolerance and freedom -- or the lack thereof -- no-smoking policies were a reason to grumble.
Then again the 61-year-old Mr.
Pintilie (pronounced pin-teel-YEE-ay), whose film opens in New York on Friday, has been known as someone who does what he wants.
After becoming one of Romania's leading directors of theater, film and television, in 1972 he was deemed subversive and unemployable by the Communist Government, which suspended his stage production of Gogol's "Inspector General," a satire of governmental bureaucracy.


What's Fair for Childless Workers?

Leslie Lafayette missed perhaps the biggest example of the married-with-children bent in our society: the United States military.


Erosion Pact Could Help Other Beaches Around U.S.
AN $80 million pact by the Army Corps of Engineers to restore the beaches of West Hampton Dunes and modify the jetties in Westhampton Beach could set a precedent for similar accords between Washington and other shorelines.
The agreement not only benefits homeowners in West Hampton Dunes who suffered severe damage in the major storm in December 1992, but it will also protect Moriches Bay and low-lying mainland areas, as well as create a two-mile-long public beach in the Hamptons.


Grandparents Day Got Its Start in the 1950's
Grandparents Day existed long before 1961 when, according to your report on Oct. 2  [ "The View From Riverdale" ] , it was conceived by Jacob Reingold, executive vice president of the Hebrew Home for the Aged.
In 1956 my agency was public relations counsel to the New York City Nursing Home Association.
Reading a news report of Grandparents Day being celebrated somewhere in the Midwest, I advised the homes in our association of this opportunity for good community relations and, of course, for some good publicity.


ABOUT BOOKS
New Jersey Murders
IT is not the kind of legacy to boast about, and nowhere near the proportions of the O. J.  Simpson case, but this state can claim some front-page murders far from easy to forget.
"Murdered in Jersey," by Gerald Tomlinson, a collection of true crime stories, cites factors that draw out the sensationalism.
Steamy sex, prominent people, unknown killers, multiple victims, depraved treatment of the deceased, shocking disclosures as the case progresses -- one or all -- move the murder to page 1.
The 60 murders included here took place between 1922 and 1992 and had one or more of those elements.


Perking Up Pasta With Wild Mushrooms
REMEMBER when the only mushrooms were cultivated whitecaps?
Now markets offer wild mushrooms: portobello, shiitake and oyster mushrooms, orange chanterelles and porcini.
Porcini are boletus mushrooms, also known as cepes, Polish mushrooms or Steinpilz.
They are good dried, too, but they need to be soaked in hot water or chicken broth for about half an hour.


Partying With Newt
The voters are angry.
When they think about where the country is headed they feel bad, but not nearly as bad as they are going to feel if they accept Representative Newt Gingrich's invitation to make Tuesday a national day of binge voting.
Mr.
Gingrich is like an enabler at a neighborhood cocktail party.
His message is familiar and seductive: Don't worry about tomorrow.
So what if it gives you a headache?
Let's tie one on!


From Runways to the Real World
The 1990's fashion silhouette appears to have crystallized on the runways and on some of the women attending the spring shows held last week in Bryant Park.
Women with the highest antennas seem to be mirroring what was shown in some of the best New York designer collections.
The look is still only a trickle on the scene (and stores report sales for it have done poorly).
But it is a style that recalls women in the paintings of the artist Reginald Marsh in the 1930's and 40's.
The cut of the satin crepe bias-cut dresses and skirts has the same saucy sensuality.
The hemline has stabilized at the top of the kneecap, and the overall image is one of understated plainness in somber black, navy, ivory, beige and an occasional brown.
It is a look that defines a generation's new sense of low-key style.

"This is what it has come to. It's intellectual violence. There's so much hatred it scares me." ALINA GAWLIK, of Falls Church, Va., describing the Senate campaign in her state.  [ 28:1. ]


County's Minutiae Codified
THOSE who live in the county may have mastered the arcana of school district lines, the vagaries of municipal boundaries and lots of the local folklore, but other little-known facts about the region are even more obscure.
How many know, for example, that the cocktail was invented in Elmsford during the Revolutionary War, that New Rochelle was a stop on the Underground Railroad and that the white oak is Westchester's official tree?
The county also has an official song, bird, flower and fish.


72d St. Riders Protest Delay In Repairs
Four years after West Siders were told that the subway station at Broadway and 72d Street would be renovated and expanded, news that the project has been deferred indefinitely for lack of funds has ignited outrage from local residents, who staged a rally on Thursday night to call attention to what they say are the station's dangerous conditions.
While the rally may have provided an emotional lift to the 100 straphangers who attended, transit officials say it is unlikely to restore financing to the project, which was budgeted for $40 million in 1990 but is now estimated to cost up to $200 million.
Because of the new cost projections and municipal budget cuts, the Transit Authority announced last month that renovations to the station at 72d Street and Broadway and five other stations would be deferred.


Kara A. Dolan, William Callahan
Kara Anne Dolan, a daughter of Kathleen and Kenneth T. Dolan of Rockville Centre, L.I., was married there yesterday to William John Callahan, the son of Ann Marie and William L. Callahan of Blauvelt, N.Y.
Thomas Aquinas Dolan, a Roman Catholic deacon who is the bride's uncle, performed the ceremony at the Cathedral of St.
Agnes.
Mrs.
Callahan, 25, graduated from Manhattan College, as did the bridegroom.
She is a junior account executive at M Booth &amp; Associates, a public relations company in Manhattan.
Her father is a captain in the New York City Fire Department in Manhattan.
Her mother is a legal secretary in Rockville Centre.


The Early Signs Of a New SoHo?
West Chelsea, long dominated by old warehouses, factory buildings and automobile repair garages, has suddenly blossomed into a serious player in the city's art scene.
Several new galleries and dozens of studios have opened in recent months, and more are on the way.
Some people are calling the neighborhood the new SoHo, and it is, in fact, attracting artists fleeing old SoHo's high rents.
A few think it should have a new name: WeChe.


Lynn E. Becker, Samuel M. Haber
Lynn Ellen Becker, a daughter of Anita and Murray Becker of River Vale, N.J., is to be married today to Samuel Myles Haber, a son of Muriel and Dennis Haber of New City, N.Y.

The bride, 33, is a candidate for a Ph.D. in English education at New York University.
She graduated from Muhlenberg College and received a master's degree in teaching English from Montclair State University.


Black-White Issue, Gray Area: Redistricting Plan Is Pulled
After an avalanche of protests, an advisory panel appointed by the Board of Education last week scrapped its original proposal to carve out new school districts for Southeast Brooklyn.
But though sighs of relief were heard throughout the area, the board, under court order, will probably have to revisit the unresolved issue in the future: In two districts where blacks make up more than half the combined student population, only 2 of the total of 18 representatives on the school boards are black.


Michelle Powers, John C. Dougherty
Michelle Powers, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Richard W. Powers of Oradell, N.J., was married yesterday to John Caleb Dougherty, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Jude P. Dougherty of Potomac, Md.
Msgr.
Robert S. Sokolowski performed the ceremony at St.
Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in Oradell.
Mrs.
Dougherty, 27, is an associate counsel in the Office of the Inspector General at the State Department in Washington.
She graduated cum laude from Boston College, and she and the bridegroom received law degrees from Catholic University of America.
Her father is a vice president and the associate general tax counsel at the ITT Corporation in New York.


Coach's Corner
To the Sports Editor:
As the coach of the current national champion cheerleading squad, I feel compelled to respond to Jane Gottesman's article that demeans all high school cheerleaders.
I am a local representative for the International Cheerleading Association, I've had contact with literally hundreds of squads across the country and I know of no cheering team that gets its attire from Frederick's.


Oh, Yes, About Peter and That Poor Wolf . . .
A Report From the Ethics-in-Music Society CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS HAS been made toward the banning of Haydn's music from public performance.
As the myth of a benign Papa Haydn gives way to an awareness of the composer's personal and professional life, indignation in the music community continues to grow.


Capriati Set for Return
ANKE HUBER has the ranking and the seeding.
Her opponent will bring the fans and media to their first-round meeting.
JENNIFER CAPRIATI will play in her first tournament in 14 months when she takes on sixth-seeded Huber Tuesday or Wednesday night in the Virginia Slims of Philadelphia.
Capriati's agent, BARBARA PERRY, who also is the tournament director, said Capriati is "fit now and ready to go." (AP)


A Voters' Guide
A guide to the candidates in the major races in New Jersey and Connecticut, including the major Congressional contests, appears on page 54.


Danny De Vito: Center of the Universe?
Almost everyone considers Michael Ovitz the most powerful man in Hollywood.
But did his name come up in connection with "Pulp Fiction," a movie that some say transformed movie making?
We think not.
Instead, it can be argued that Danny DeVito is not only the most powerful man in Hollywood but also the center of the universe.
Through this actor-director-producer-beautician, anyone could theoretically get to anyone else.
Producing, through his company Jersey Films, has made Mr.
DeVito's reach all encompassing.
The company's productions run the gamut of subjects (and studios) from "Hoffa" (20th Century Fox) to "Reality Bites" (Universal) to "Pulp Fiction" (Miramax).
Next up: "Get Shorty" (MGM), starring John Travolta and "Feeling Minnesota" (New Line Cinema), starring Keanu Reeves.
Mr.
DeVito will also direct "Matilda," based on the Roald Dahl children's book, for Universal.
Here's how Mr.
DeVito Links up to the universe.
JOSH YOUNG GRAMMY WINNERS
Mr.
DeVito appeared in "Ruthless People" with Bette Midler, opened for Barbra Streisand at a benefit for Bill Clinton and was born in Asbury Park, N.J., the town Bruce Springsteen put on the map.
PEOPLE WITH TELEVISIONS
Nearly everyone remembers Mr.
DeVito from the series "Taxi." "People pat me on the back, and say, 'Hey, how are Rhea and the kids?"' Mr.
DeVito said.
Anyone deprived of "Taxi" has certainly been to "Cheers," where Mr.
DeVito's real-life wife, Rhea Periman, served drinks as Carla.
WORLD LEADERS (INCLUDING MICHAEL OVITZ)
In "Junior," which opens on Nov. 26, an airline flight attendant (played by Judy Ovitz, wife of Michael Ovitz) tries to eject the DeVito character from the First-class cabin.
"Let's face it, Danny knows everyone," says Ivan Reitman, the film's director.
Also co-starring: Emma Thompson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Kennedy spouse and head of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports during the Bush Administration.
GENERATION X
For a 50-year-old, Mr.
DeVito has impeccable credentials with 20-somethings.
"Reality Bits," directed by Ben Stiller, 28, and written by Helen Childress, 24, is known as the definitive Gen-X movie.
If not for Mr.
DeVito and his partner, Michael Shamberg, backing this film, the revival of the Knack's hit "My Sharona" might be years away.
ALUMNI OF THE WILFRED ACADEMY OF HAIR AND BEAUTY CULTURE
The Wilfred Academy once had 58 branches in the New York area.
After completing his studies in Asbury Park in 1964, Mr.
DeVito got his beautician's license and practiced at his sister's salon.
Told that all Wilfred outlets are now closed, Mr.
DeVito sheepishly admitted, "I haven't kept up with my alma mater." NEW HOLLYWOOD
Jersey Films has made movies at nearly every studio except its home base, Columbia Pictures, so it shouldn't be surprising if the company gets a film going with the new studio formed by Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg, and David Geffen.
During Mr.
Katzenberg's reign at Walt Disney Studios, Mr.
DeVito starred in three Disney films: "Tin Men," "Ruthless People" and "Renaissance Man." OLD HOLLYWOOD
Mr.
DeVito's first turn on the golf course was with Jack Nicholson, a close friend since they appeared together in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest " (1975).
"I played 18 holes my first time out, and I lost every ball in Jack's bag," Mr.
DeVito said.
"Michael" -- Michael Douglas, a pal since the 70's and a collaborator on four DeVito films -- "is a golf enthusiast too, but I'm not getting out there with him." Mr.
Nicholson's best friend is Warren Beatty.
QUENTIN TARANTINO
Since the critical success of "Pulp Fiction," Quentin Tarantino is a universe unto himself.
Three years ago, Stacey Sher, president of Jersey Films, slipped Mr.
DeVito and Michael Shamberg the script for "Reservoir Dogs," then in production.
Jersey Films bought Mr.
Tarantino's next script, for "Pulp Fiction," sight unseen and was the executive producer of the film, distributed through Miramax.
"The only guidance you need to give a guy that talented is what kind of lenses to use," Mr.
DeVito said.

Last Call for Getting In the Spring Bulbs
WHY do today what can surely be done next week?
This sort of procrastination is typical of gardeners.
Inspired by a few weeks of beautiful mild weather, they postpone those inevitable chores, particularly bulb planting.
But the weeks move along with amazing speed and there are no surer reminders than the early-fading light of fall days and the page-turning of the trusty calendar that winter is on its way.
With it will come frozen soil and snow.
So good gardeners, do be sporting and carry on.
Even a traditional deadline for planting tulips -- Election Day -- is on the horizon.


No Room At the Dorm; Inn Will Do
BEFORE the start of the fall term at New York University, about 200 freshmen were notified that they could not be accommodated in campus housing.
Instead, the university had leased space for them in an off-campus hotel, the South Gate.
When letters explaining the arrangement went out, complaints started coming in, a university official said.
Not even the university's president, L. Jay Oliva, was immune from the onslaught of angry telephone calls of protest.
But the school was in a jam, and the cause was the lack of a "melt."


Voters and Candidates Meet On Information Superhighway
The Internet and other spurs of the information superhighway have emerged as powerful new links between politicians and voters in this election year, adding forums for debate by the candidates, nearly instant voting results and vast pools of background information for local, state and national races.
The idea of electronic democracy has spread to nearly every state along with the rapid expansion of the Internet and a variety of on-line information services and electronic bulletin boards, which are used by more than five million Americans.


A New Species of Couch Potato Takes Root
CHRISTOPHER FUSCO watches his favorite television show from a chrome-legged swivel chair he bought at a yard sale.
The moment a commercial comes on, he whirls around to his I.B.M.-compatible personal computer, dials up an on-line service and types out messages to other fans who are also tuned in to "The X-Files," the Fox network's New Age answer to "The Twilight Zone" or "The Outer Limits."
When the commercial ends, Mr.
Fusco, a 24-year-old molecular biologist who lives in Germantown, Md., logs off and rolls back to the television.


A Multiculturalist Before It Was Fashionable
THE EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS by Adolph Gottlieb at the Phillips Gallery in Washington charts a subtly provocative course through a decade in American painting that has still kept some of its secrets.
"Pictograph" was Gottlieb's name for these paintings.
There are 69 of them at the Phillips, all dated between 1941 and 1953. (They will be there through Jan. 2 and will travel to the Brooklyn Museum in April.) In every case, a group of individual images or signs is corralled, each in its own rectangular space.
Those spaces vary in size and shape, but the general effect is that of a series of compartments fitted together in a steady, measured, unhurrying way.


Miracle Man
To the Sports Editor:
While the running community may be aware that the late Fred Lebow was born Fischel Leibowitz, it is not common knowledge that his final "marathon" was not the 26.2-mile race he ran with Grete Weitz in New York in 1992 but a half marathon in Israel at the 1993 Maccabiah Games.
The games is an Olympics for Jewish athletes held every four years; in 1993, the games in Israel drew 5,600 participants from 56 countries.

'In Defense of Elitism'
To the Editor:
"De mortuis," etc., but happily Roger Kimball is alive to savor the mockery he has earned with his review of the late William A. Henry 3d's "In Defense of Elitism" (Oct. 16).
He approvingly cites the "forthrightness" of Henry's observation, "The unvarnished truth is this: You could eliminate every woman writer, painter and composer from the cave man era to the present moment and not significantly deform the course of Western culture," and numbly but solicitously comments, "It is painful to admit it, I know, but Henry is right."

Math Theory Gains Ground: Girls' Classes Help Them Learn
Solving the math problem seemed simple to one school board member.
If, in fact, girls do poorly in math classes with boys, he reasoned, why not put them in math classes for girls?
Charles L. Vaughn, the board member who is the chief architect and proponent of the classes proposed in Portsmouth, said the issue for young women was their "sense of focus."


Sheila A. Tellier, J. D. Nottebohm Jr.
Sheila Ann Tellier, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Francis J. Tellier of Mamaroneck, N.Y., was married yesterday to Johann Dieterich Nottebohm Jr., the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Nottebohm of Guatemala City.
Msgr.
James F. McCarthy performed the ceremony at the Church of St.
Vincent Ferrer.
Mrs.
Nottebohm, 24, graduated from St.
Lawrence University.
She is a trading assistant in the institutional municipal-bond department at Alex.
Brown &amp; Company in New York.
Her father is a managing director of J. P. Morgan &amp; Company in New York.


PAYING FOR KEEPS
In "Paying for Keeps" (The Big City, Oct. 9), John Tierney seems to have something more like a private club in mind when he proposes that "a company" financed by user fees take over the park.
He states that "the park's new keeper should be free to run it according to users' desires, not the whims of politicians." (Those politicians are, after all, our democratically elected representatives.) Those who can't afford membership -- a cost that would no doubt escalate rapidly -- would be treated as charity cases.


The Bloopie Awards!
TIME ONCE AGAIN for the coveted Bloopie Awards, recognition of Madison Avenue solecisms that sends thrills of Schadenfreude through the ranks of advertising copywriters.
Because the top of this column gets the lowest rating (the audience increases as we approach Prime Space), we begin with the least important award, "For the most egregious abuse of the comma." Push the envelope, please:


Express to Canada
Border crossings between the United States and Canada should get speedier in the next few months thanks to an agreement between the two countries.
The pact expands the use of special express lanes known as Dedicated Commuter Lanes -- already in Blaine, Wash. -- to include Detroit and Point Roberts, Wash.
For a $25 annual fee, motorists who regularly cross the border get a windshield sticker enabling them to use the special lanes.
And in late spring, several remote unstaffed crossings in Maine, Montana, North Dakota, Vermont and Washington will be designated Automated Permit Ports, enabling preregistered commuters to pass through.


THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: Massachusetts  The Last Weekend: Senate Races Where the Battle Has Been Intense; Romney Eclectic In Final Sprint
Mitt Romney, the Republican venture capitalist who wants to replace Senator Edward M. Kennedy, is down in the polls as the election campaign nears the wire.
So he is borrowing a tactic or two from Presidential races of recent and not-so-recent memory.
Taking a page from the Ross Perot scrapbook, Mr.
Romney went on television Friday night with the first broadcast of a new half-hour commercial.
Then, appropriating an old Harry S. Truman trademark, the Romney campaign pulled out of North Station here this afternoon on a whistle-stop train tour.
And Mr.
Romney plans to spend Sunday campaigning through the state by bus, reminiscent of the Clinton-Gore caravans of 1992.

Principles and Politics Collide In Tangled Execution Dispute
When Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo insisted last year that Thomas Grasso serve a 20-year-to-life term for a murder in New York before being executed for another murder in Oklahoma, he said he was defending legal principles: that a killer convicted in two states should serve sentences in the order they were handed down and that no politician should overrule a judge's sentence.
But in the final days of the gubernatorial campaign, State Senator George E. Pataki, who favors the death penalty and says that, if elected, he would try to have Mr.
Grasso returned to Oklahoma to be executed, has focused on the case to highlight Mr.
Cuomo's longstanding opposition to capital punishment -- which the Governor has vetoed in each of the 12 years of his administration.


Religions Are Putting Faith in Environmentalism
Considering that insulation, energy-saving light bulbs and low-flow shower heads are sold along with menorahs and seder plates, the gift shop at Temple Adath Joseph might seem like a one-stop shop for the observant and conservation-minded handyman.
Rabbi Jeffrey Glickman considers all the items to be Judaica, and he will even help install them.
"The concept of the environment is central to Judaism," said Rabbi Glickman, who also talks about ecology at services at the Reform temple in St.
Joseph, Mo.
"God, who could have done any number of things to talk to Elijah, didn't waste. He used the smallest possible means for communication: the still, small voice. We should choose the same."


Work Ended, Trusteeship Council Resists U.N. Ax for Now
The United Nations almost succeeded in eliminating a small part of its bureaucracy this week, but the Charter has allowed it to remain in business even though it has no work to do.
On Tuesday the United States, which had administered the Palau island chain since 1947 at the behest of the United Nations, formally notified the Trusteeship Council that Palau's 16,000 people had officially voted to become a sovereign nation.
Palau is located about 600 miles east of the southern Philippines.

A Hummable Treasure Hunt
To the Editor:
After reading Andrea Marcovicci's essay "Cabaret Is Where You Go for Tenderness"  [ Oct. 16 ] , I went back to two words that perfectly describe my motivation and specialty as a collector of old melodies: obscure treasures.
Here are just a few of the gleanings from 10 years' work going through untold thousands of 78's and LP's and seeing old musicals at the Dryden Theater of Eastman House here in Rochester.

New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. $15. (Ages 10 and up)


Diane McNicholas, William Rapavy
Diane Maria McNicholas, a daughter of Margaret and James McNicholas of Dix Hills, L.I., and William G. Rapavy, a son of Judith and William Rapavy of Scotia, N.Y., were married yesterday at the National Arts Club in New York.
Acting Justice Harold Silverman of the State Supreme Court in the Bronx performed the ceremony.
The bride, 29, is a textile designer in New York.
She graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology.
Her father retired as a systems analyst at the Grumman Corporation in Bethpage, L.I.


Sports of The Times; 'I Knew He Wasn't Going To Get Up'
FOR more than two decades, the enduring image of George Foreman was that of his being toppled onto the canvas by Muhammad Ali's right hand in the eighth round in Kinshasa, Zaire.
Then 25 years old, big George had appeared unbeatable and he had been: 40-0 with 37 knockouts.
But suddenly he had been knocked out.
Suddenly he was an ex-heavyweight champion.
Suddenly he had been the dope in what Ali would later describe as the "rope-a-dope."


Promising Young Riders Set for Maclay

Madness Is Message for Thomas, and He's Crazy Like a Fox
Thurman Thomas.
Volatile.
Mischievous.
The primary symbol of the Buffalo Bills' Super Bowl woes.
An attention seeker.
A chip on his shoulder.
Rude.
Thurman Thomas.
A family man, married for seven years to Patty and a loving father to two daughters, Olivia, 5 years old, and Angelica, 3.
A running back who proved National Football League scouts wrong, lasting until the second round and the 40th pick in the 1988 draft and then becoming the only one to lead the league in total yards from scrimmage for four consecutive seasons -- 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992.
A true source of inspiration in Buffalo's four-year domination of the American Conference.
The lightning rod -- and rallying point -- of the Bills' locker room.


Election Day Fantasy
AS YOU ENTER THE voting booth on Tuesday, bear in mind that a fiercely contested seat in the United States Senate now costs between $10 million and $20 million, probably more in California.
The governorship of New York will cost the winner about $10 million and the losers another $10 million.
Electing the entire House of Representatives cost more than $300 million in 1992, and 60 of the winners spent more than $1 million each.
Much of this money can be fairly called a bribe -- it is laboriously gathered from corporations and individuals seeking favors from Government.
No more desirably, some of it comes from the personal fortunes of candidates.
Most of the money goes to buy television commercials that are often misleading and even mendacious.
Charges of drug dealing, tax cheating and criminal coddling crowd the screen, with not even a pretense of proof.
Television, in other words, has simultaneously corrupted and debased the American political system.
That stark sentiment is widely acknowledged even by the compromised members of Congress.
But the search for remedies has been frustrated by their diverse self-interests.
And, alas, too few of the remedies address the central problem: the high cost and low quality of TV ads.
True reform -- a revolution really -- would force the candidates to forgo commercials in return for free television time, in segments long enough to make them debate their issues and qualifications.
Considering the failure of lesser reforms, it's a fantasy worth pursuing.
THE PRESENT SCANDAL HAS two dimensions.
By surrendering enormous influence to organized donors -- the political action committees of bankers or physicians or environmentalists -- the system distorts and blocks legislation in every field.
And by filling the campaign chests of incumbents, the committees enfeeble all challengers except millionaires who can subsidize themselves.
The PAC's don't just pursue their own little loopholes and benefits.
They join with like-minded others to acquire the force of what the former Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire has called "wolf packs."
Moreover, the influence of PAC's extends beyond a single vote.
As the former Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin has said: "It may come in a speech not delivered . . . in a colleague not influenced. It may come in a calling off of a meeting . . . in a minor change in one paragraph . . . in a witness not invited to testify." PAC's don't always win, but they are investors, betting on a high rate of return.
They favor incumbents over challengers by a ratio of $10 to $1.
As for the millionaires, they were given a fast lane to political power in 1976 when the Supreme Court simultaneously upheld laws that limit contributions to candidates but struck down, on free-speech grounds, limits on spending by candidates.
That has produced high rollers like Representative Michael Huffington, the Republican candidate for the Senate in California, who lent or gave himself at least $17 million this year, and Senator Herb Kohl, the Wisconsin Democrat whose own $3.5 million fund is 10 times the amount his challenger could raise.
The risk of encountering such a rich opponent also means that the moment they win one contest, legislators turn to special interests for help in amassing a huge war chest for the next.
If they thus discourage a challenger, so much the better; they can then become a PAC themselves by giving to other campaigns -- or employ the imaginative strategies by which members continue to divert leftover campaign funds to personal spending: a car or two, restaurant accounts, a "study" trip abroad.
MINDFUL THAT JOURNALists, for some reason, are widely suspected of cynicism, let me turn from sordid reality to the realm of reform.
The most successful reform yet devised dealt with the election of Presidents.
By raising a lot of money in small amounts, candidates can qualify for Federal matching funds and, if nominated, they can qualify for full subsidy by accepting a limit on total spending.
That limit in 1992 was $55 million -- except that roundabout contributions to the Democratic and Republican Parties allowed them to spend an additional $71 million and $62 million respectively to help Bill Clinton and George Bush offset the challenge of Ross Perot's own $60 million.
A Federal Elections Commission is supposed to prevent such evasions, but its three members from each party can't often reach a majority decision of consequence.
It is also woefully underfinanced; not until last May did it fine the Bush campaign for fund-raising violations in early 1988!
The larger lesson here is that money that wants to be spent will find a way to be spent, like water seeking its level.
Limit spending for Clinton speeches and he'll find a surrogate to celebrate an unnamed political genius in Arkansas; limit spending on Bush rallies and he'll spend for "get out the vote" meetings in his Houston neighborhood.
Give away free television time and the candidates will use the money they save to write personal letters to 150 million voters every week.
But no matter: if given abundant television time, no candidate would lack the means to get a well-rounded message to the electorate.
And if given enough television time in return for giving up TV ads, candidates would be liberated from endless fund-raising and from the dictates of special pleaders.
A half-hour a day, including some prime time, for a few weeks before elections should suffice to cover all but very local races.
Some interviews, some debates, with the real candidates, not hired guns and graphics.
Force campaign coverage onto broadcast television but not onto cable and into newspapers and magazines?
Yes, indeed, and for very good reasons.
Broadcast television has largely given up serious coverage of elections even as television commercials have become the main campaign arena. (Cable at least subsidizes the excellent C-Span programs.)
The most compelling reason, however, is that broadcast television bears a huge public debt.
In exchange for the promise of "public service," licensed television stations never paid a cent for the use of the broadcast spectrum or for the law that required cable systems to carry their programs.
They still owe us, for many decades.
Come the millennium, perhaps we'll collect and reclaim our democracy.


The Nation; Stone Walls Do Not a Prison Make, Shoppers
CROSS Orwell with the wireless-digital age and a Madison Avenue sensibility and you might come close to some of the ads appearing in Corrections Today.
Recent years have been good for the glossy magazine, the official publication of the American Correctional Association and the biggest in the country geared to corrections departments, wardens and other prison administrators and staff.
Seven times a year it goes out to each of the association's roughly 20,000 members -- many of whom have a big say in how Federal, state or local tax dollars are spent on prisons and jails.
Thus the magazine is a powerful tool for advertisers of just about anything its readers might want to buy -- from riot batons to barbed-wire fences to electronic surveillance systems to modular housing units to entire prisons.


If You're Thinking of Living In/North Salem; Charm, Tradition, Space, High Taxes
TUCKED into the northeast corner of Westchester County is a rustic community of graceful horse farms and estates amid thousands of acres of lush woodlands and apple orchards.
This is North Salem, only 50 miles north of Manhattan, a horseman's paradise of open fields and rugged hills surrounding the New York City-owned Titicus Reservoir.
Three-quarters of the land is zoned for four acres or more and there are no sidewalks, sewers or public water supply.
Until last year, there were no numbers on houses.


Corrections
An article in the Frugal Traveler column on page 6 of the Travel section today, about Sofia, Bulgaria, appears in some copies with part of a sentence missing.
The affected passage, starting with the last line of column 5, should read, "There were two other guest rooms as well, occupied by an American in charge of a placement agency for Bulgarian orphans and a Canadian filmmaker named Robert."


The Two-'L' Llama Is a Beast, but Peaceable
WHEN Richard Snyder began to walk the perimeters of the old farm he bought in Milford, Pa., almost 10 years ago, he looked out over the overgrown pastures and woods with the eyes of a farm boy.
"I grew up on a dairy farm in Carlisle," he said.
"My father, at age 83, is still farming 150 acres. But I hated it as a kid. Getting up before dawn to milk the cows. Picking stones out of the field. It was so boring."


A Modest Gain for the Bosnian Serbs as Muslims Regroup
Bosnian Serb forces have regained some ground against Bosnian Government troops in the northwest, United Nations officials in Sarajevo and Bosnian Croat militia officials here said today.
The United Nations officials said the Bosnian Serbs had retaken Kulen Vakuf, a village 20 miles southeast of Bihac in what appeared to be a tactical withdrawal by Government forces.
The village was captured when the Muslim-led Bosnian Army launched an attack 10 days ago in which it gained 95 square miles of territory that had been in Bosnian Serb control for more than two years.

Weegee's Grisly Images Gaze on These Dancers
"I DON'T RELATE TO VIOLENT crime," the choreographer Susan Marshall was saying.
"No one in my circle of loved ones has ever been touched by that." As she talked while sipping tea in a cafe near her apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, her hands took the precaution of knocking on every wooden surface within reach, a comic ripple in her otherwise intense demeanor.
"Unfortunately, I do know something about illness," she continued.
"It's a slower-acting violence but similar in its randomness. People are caught in its wake and don't understand what's happening. Fate steps in, and we're left to pick up the pieces."


Life of a Mother Accused of Killing Offers No Clues
On the evening of Oct. 24, Susan Smith went to her aerobics class.
The next morning, she took her children to a baby sitter and went to work at her job as a secretary.
That night, investigators say, Mrs.
Smith pulled her car to the edge of a deep lake, stepped out, put the gearshift in drive and let it roll down the boat ramp into the black water.
Her two little boys, buckled snugly in their safety seats, died under the lake.
To the people of Union who grew up with Mrs.
Smith, who remember tying ribbons in her hair when she was a little girl, who enjoyed her smile -- everyone talks about the smile -- it is as if there are two Susans.
They talk over and over about what caused her to kill her own children, but nothing, for many people, will ever explain how this woman, who seemed to be a perfect mother and so hard-working and devout, could do such a thing.


Stefanie H. Roth, David N. Dishy
Stefanie Helene Roth, a daughter of Ellen and Paul Roth of New York, is to be married today to David Neil Dishy, the son of Linda and Bernard Dishy, also of New York.
Rabbi Thomas K. Weiner is to perform the ceremony at Central Synagogue in New York.
The bride, 27, graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
She also received a law degree from Harvard.
Until recently she was a law clerk for Judge John S. Martin Jr. of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York.
In January, she is to become an associate at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton, the New York law firm.
Her father is a founding partner in Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel, the law firm in New York.
Her mother is a psychotherapist in New York.


Farcical Doings in 'Rough Crossing'
THERE'S nothing quite like the sound of cascading laughter to get a play off and bolting.
No sooner does the curtain at the McCarter Theater go up on John Lee Beatty's swank Art Deco shipboard design for Tom Stoppard's "Rough Crossing" than Dvornichek, a steward, tilts forward, bearing a tray of Cognac.
It's not the ship that's listing, mind you, it's Dvornichek -- from side to side, backward and forward again.
Clearly his response to a call for Cognac is strictly self-serving.


Perking Up Pasta With Wild Mushrooms
REMEMBER when the only mushrooms were cultivated whitecaps?
Now markets offer wild mushrooms: portobello, shiitake and oyster mushrooms, orange chanterelles and porcini.
Porcini are boletus mushrooms, also known as cepes, Polish mushrooms or Steinpilz.
They are good dried, too, but they need to be soaked in hot water or chicken broth for about half an hour.


Ideas &amp; Trends; 'My Choice All Along, Starting Now!'
THE single image that voters were not supposed to see this season was that of one political figure grasping the hand of another and holding it aloft.
At a time when even the incumbents are trying to disavow the entire political system and its hoary trappings, who would want to be seen in the tired embrace of an admitted politician?
And yet, in brazen defiance of the conventional wisdom, endorsements are suddenly and dramatically back.
Two of the most memorable and possibly pivotal moments of the political season occurred when incumbent Republican mayors crossed party lines to support Democrats, in New York's gubernatorial race and the Senate campaign in California.
A long line of Republicans, including Ronald and Nancy Reagan, has given an anti-endorsement to Oliver L. North, their party's Senate candidate in Virginia, blasting him as a liar, though Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, swallowed hard and backed the ex-marine.


What's Fair for Childless Workers?
To the Editor:
Kudos to Leslie Lafayette for her essay on fair play for childless workers.
As a man in banking, I have felt the unstated expectation of covering for my female colleagues on the "mommy track." They can work flexible hours and still receive promotions as high as vice president, some even while on maternity leave, yet when broaching the subject of time flexibility so that I could pursue my M.B.A. studies or care for a sick parent, the response I received was less than favorable.
Luckily my present employer, because of its relatively small size and good corporate culture, is highly sensitive to all its employees.

A Bach Maestro Tackles Mahler, or Vice Versa
OF ALL THE CLASSICAL music performers known to Americans chiefly through recordings, few are better known to serious collectors than the Belgian conductor Philippe Herreweghe.
Mr.
Herreweghe, who will conduct the Orchestra of St.
Luke's and two European choruses in a program of Faure, Weill and Stravinsky on Thursday evening at Carnegie Hall, has performed in the United States only once, on a West Coast tour in 1984.
But because of his remarkable range of sympathies and his zest for the unhackneyed, listeners of many stripes have encountered him on one overgrown musical path or another.
His two latest CD's for Harmonia Mundi France are typically contrasted: Orlandus Lassus' "Lagrime di San Pietro" (901483) and Gustav Mahler's "Lied von der Erde," as reduced for chamber forces by Arnold Schoenberg and Reiner Riehn (901477).
Both are somber works, each amounting to a grand, late summation by its composer, but they have little else in common.


Running Around the Country (Literally) and Other Marathon Tales
The world's first marathoner didn't get to enjoy the fruits of victory for very long.
Legend has it that in 490 B.C., Pheidippides ran 25 miles from a battlefield at Marathon to tell the Greeks in Athens that they had defeated the Persians.
Once the message was delivered, the tuckered-out runner promptly dropped dead.
Training methods and medical care have improved in the past two and a half millennia, so the vast majority of the runners lined up in Staten Island this morning at the start of the New York City Marathon should be able to proclaim their own victories: I won; I improved my time; I made it.
Their trek through the five boroughs of New York will mark the 25th time the city's marathon has been run.
Although it isn't the oldest marathon and it isn't the most grueling, it can boast that it provides the world's longest urinal for the world's largest starting group of runners.
Boasting rights for other marathons as well as some odder incidents in the history of the sport, are noted at right.
ANNE CRONIN WORLD'S OLDEST MARATHON -- The modern Olympic games, which began in 1896, included a 40-kilometer (24.85-mile) marathon.
It was won by Spiridon Loues of Greece, with a 2:58:50 time.
OLDEST IN U.S. -- The Boston Marathon, first run 1897, is the world's oldest annual marathon.
Members of the Boston Athletic Association had attended the 1896 Olympic games and decided to start a marathon in Boston.
The race, then 24.7 miles, was won by John J. McDermott in 2:55:10, although he walked several times during the final miles.
GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT -- John A. Kelley ran the Boston Marathon 61 straight years, from 1931 to 1992.
He won twice, in 1935 and 1945, and came in second seven times.
In one of his runner-up runs, Mr.
Kelley tapped Ellison "Tarzan" Brown, then leading, as he passed him.
This riled Mr.
Brown, who redoubled his efforts and went on to win.
The spot of the tap was called "Heartbreak Hill" in The Boston Globe the next day.
The name stuck.
HOW THE MARATHON GOT ITS LENGTH -- Marathons were generally 40 kilometers long until the 1908 Olympics in London.
Princess Mary, who was the official starter for the race, asked whether the starting line could be moved to Windsor Castle, so her children could watch from the nursey windows.
This extended the course to 26 miles, 385 yards to the finish line.
The longer "London" distance was adopted as the standard in 1924.
PLEASE DON'T USE THE BUSHES -- The world's largest urinal will be installed at the start of the New York City Marathon in Staten Island.
The 290-foot facility will be located at the Fort Wadsworth Naval Station along with 350 portable toilets.
Another 200 portable toilets will be placed along the route.
A CAST OF THOUSANDS -- This year, more than 27,000 runners will be competing in the New York City Marathon, which could break its own record for most starters -- 28,656 in 1992.
The London Marathon is the second largest, with 25,194 this year.
SHOELESS ABEBE -- The 1960 Rome Olympic marathon was won by an Ethiopian who had never run a marathon outside Addis Ababa.
Abebe Bikila ran barefoot and won with a record time of 2:15:16.2.
He was also the first man to ever win consecutive Olympic marathons, finishing the race in Toyko with another record time of 2:12:11.2, despite having had an appendectomy a month before.
He wore shoes the second time around.
GOLD STANDARD -- The record for Olympic marathon wins is two, shared by Mr.
Bikila (1960, 1964) and Waldemar Cierpinski of East Germany (1976, 1980).
Grete Waltz of Norway won in New York nine times (1978-80, 1982-86, 1988).
WOMEN'S FIRSTS -- The first woman officially entered in a marathon was Violet Percy of Great Britain, who ran the 1926 London Marathon in 3:40:22.
The first championship marathon for women was held by the Road Runners Club of America in 1970.
Women's Olympic marathons began in 1984.
LONG HAULS -- The longest marathon races ever were the 1920's transcontinental runs from Los Angeles to New York City.
Andy Payne ran 3,422 miles in 1928 with a time of 573:04:34.
Johnny Salo won the 1929 version of 3,665 miles in 525:57:2, for an average of 6.97 miles per hour.
The longest annual race is Australia's Westfield Run.
The record for the 658 miles was set by Yiannis Kouros of Greece in 1989; 5 days, 2 hours, 27 minutes, 27 seconds.
The longest individual run on record was Sara Covington-Fulcher's lap around the United States, starting and finishing in Los Angeles.
The 11,134 miles took from July 21, 1987, to Oct. 2, 1988, to cover.

Suspension Upheld
An appeals panel in Monte Carlo, Monaco, agreed yesterday with track's governing body that JOHN NGUGI, the five-time world cross country champion from Kenya, was wrong in refusing to give a urine sample to an agent who visited his home.
The panel upheld a four-year suspension imposed by the International Amateur Athletic Federation.


Butch Cassidy et al.
To the Editor: Butch Cassidy in Patagonia is anything but mythical ("Magellan's Route in Tierra del Fuego," Oct. 9).
As the author of "Digging Up Butch and Sundance," I can report that not only did Butch spend four years ranching peacefully in Northern Patagonia's Cholila Valley with the Sundance Kid and Etta Place in the early 1900's, but that he and Sundance later robbed a bank in Rio Gallegos, Argentina, a mere 50 miles from the Strait of Magellan.
What is mythical is the Hollywood version, which skipped the Patagonian chapter in the saga of the Old West's most affable and peripatetic outlaws.

Stacey Blumberg, Steven Paradise
Stacey Eileen Blumberg and Steven Robert Paradise, associates at New York law firms, were married last evening at the Glen Head (L.I.) Country Club.
Rabbi Gilbert Rosenthal, the executive director of the New York Board of Rabbis, performed the ceremony.
Mrs.
Paradise, 28, works at Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher.
She graduated from the University of Michigan, as did her husband, and received her law degree from New York University.
She is a daughter of Martin and Maxine Blumberg of Woodbury, L.I.


Across Uganda's Rich Land By Train
NEARLY a century ago, England set out to cement control of its East African colonies, not by war, law or religion, but by locomotion, building a train line from Nairobi into Uganda's interior that first touched the shores of Lake Victoria and was eventually extended to Kampala.
Surmounting inauspicious beginnings -- a host of singularly African plagues, from malaria to man-eating lions to tribal tensions and cost overruns -- the railway was begun in 1895 and completed in 1928.
It became such an important conduit of goods and people that trains running twice daily between Kenya and Uganda were full with passengers, who included in the early years Theodore Roosevelt and Winston Churchill.
Churchill called Uganda the "Pearl of Africa," a sobriquet that stuck.
But in the early 1970's Idi Amin put his chokehold on Uganda, and the East African community, which had created common currency and markets among Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, rancorously disintegrated.
By 1977 relations had so seriously deteriorated that the Nairobi-Kampala train trips came to a screeching, 17-year halt.


Born Predators
To the Sports Editor:
Despite Pete Bodo's conclusion that it is the pronghorn antelope's speed that is its liability, it is obvious that it is Bodo's and other hunters' penchant for slaughter that is the beautiful animal's vexation.
As Bodo sits safely behind a high-powered rifle aiming for a "clean kill," he notes in passing that the antelope's natural predators have become extinct or have been eliminated.
Thankfully, Bodo and his cohorts have taken it upon themselves to assume the role of natural-born predators.
Now, we can all rest easy knowing that nature's forces are still in balance.

Her mother, Gloria Hoffman, is the guidance director at Rye High School.


Frugal Travel
To the Editor: My husband and I write to support the Frugal Traveler column.
We lived overseas for over 20 years, all of that time in developing countries, and traveled extensively.
Even though we were able to afford luxury accommodations, we almost always opted for the frugal.
Our reasons are valid for a good segment of travelers.


Diana J. Blaney, Bruce M. Sabados
Diana Jean Blaney, a daughter of Kathleen and Henry Blaney of Bedford, N.Y., was married there yesterday to Bruce Mathew Sabados, the son of Nancy and Eugene Sabados of Shelton, Conn.
The Rev.
John Kauta performed the ceremony at St.
Patrick's Roman Catholic Church.


Fliers Are Snapping At G.M.H.C.
Fliers have begun appearing in mailboxes, headlined G.M.H.C.
Watchdog and taking on the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the world's first and largest private AIDS agency.
It's the latest in a series of disputes between two men and the agency, headquartered at 129 West 20th Street.
As the agency has grown, from an emergency self-help group in 1981 to an employer of 300, challenges have arisen from within and without over the organization's leadership and mission.
Jim Fielding and Scott Melvin, who are producing the fliers, say they represent present and former G.M.H.C. workers, volunteers, clients and donors "who have become disillusioned" with some of its policies.
But Daniel Wolfe, a G.M.H.C. spokesman, called them "two disgruntled former employees with a fax machine" and an ax to grind.
The two, who left G.M.H.C. this year, led a failed attempt to unionize the staff, and Mr.
Fielding has filed an AIDS discrimination suit against G.M.H.C.
The fliers, mailed to a list of about 300, accuse G.M.H.C. of dropping its distribution of free condoms at gay bars and clubs.
Mr.
Wolfe said G.M.H.C. is simply asking bar and club owners to pay about eight cents a condom.

In the Region/Connecticut; Once-Sliding Agriculture Is Making a Comeback
FOR hundreds of years, Connecticut, like much of America, was farm country -- until the 50's, when city folk began pouring into its villages, wealthy suburbs and developing subdivisions, and hundreds of office buildings created an urbanized state.
Only about 400,000 of Connecticut's 3.2 million acres is farmland today.
But 1.7 million acres of forest and 50,000 acres of shellfish grounds bring the total amount of agricultural land to more than 2.1 million acres.

Wilson Never Called for 'Identity Card'
To the Editor:
"California Governor Suggests Requiring Citizenship Cards" (front page, Oct. 27) misrepresents what I have proposed to help deal with the consequences of illegal immigration.


Overturning a Rent Law That Benefited a Hospital
CORPORATIONS do not occupy apartments; people do.
A decision by the New York State Court of Appeals last month in a case involving Lenox Hill Hospital makes a point of that distinction, and in the process advances the cause of ownership control over the occupancy of rent-regulated apartments.
It also calls new attention to the problem hospitals have in helping nurses find housing in Manhattan.


Editorial Notebook; The Rites of Fall New York's Religion: What Else but Fashion?
To the list of most-repeated lies -- the check is in the mail, I'm from the government and I'm here to help you -- add one more: I don't care what I look like.
Especially in New York, this is self-deception at its most flagrant.
A quick look at police statistics, combined with a little basic research, will confirm that people are much more likely to commit a major felony than to show up at the office in the wrong shoes.
Yet even here, in this city of surfaces, where walking down the street looking good is the most widely practiced art form, people cling to another strange vanity: that they have none.


. . .and a Home for a Nomad
Public School 235 has never had a building to call home -- unless one counts the abandoned supermarket in which it was founded 24 years ago.
The product of a grass-roots campaign to provide bilingual education for Morrisania's growing Puerto Rican population, P.S. 235's birth had the misfortune of coinciding with the South Bronx's decline.
So, after nearly a quarter of a century, some of its students are at Public School 11, while others share space a few miles away at Intermediate School 148.

Few Trained In Teaching Junior High
NEARLY half the nation's middle-school teachers received no special training for teaching 10-to-15-year-olds, a new study finds.
"If this were medicine, it would be considered malpractice," said Dr.
Peter Scales, an author of the study, "Growing Pains: The Making of America's Middle School Teachers."
"The ages 10 to 15 are a critical period where we can put young people on a path to a safe, productive adulthood," he said, "or we can lose them to pregnancies, substance abuse or dropping out." About 60 percent of the 2,100 respondents in five states had not even gained experience as student teachers in middle schools, said Dr.
Scales, who is the director of national initiatives at the Center for Early Adolescence at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.


CHARLES MURRAY
Charles Murray says that what he is peddling is social science porn ("Daring Research or 'Social Science Pornography' "? by Jason DeParle, Oct. 9).
I pray that it will not turn into sociological poison.
The moral conclusions do not follow from his data.
People who have lower I.Q.'s deserve more of our help, not less.
His data are clearly in error; the American economy has grown in years that our collective I.Q. is said to have declined, while the economies of white-only societies have collapsed (Eastern Europe) or are lagging.
Rapid-growth economies are largely nonwhite.


County Getting Millions in Mental Health Windfall
AT a time when most agencies are struggling with reduced budgets and major cutbacks, the county's Department of Community Mental Health has just received a windfall, because of legislation passed last year requiring that money saved from the closing of state psychiatric institutions be reinvested in the communities they once served.
Dr.
Richard Surles, Commissioner of the State Office of Mental Health, presented a check to the county for $3.2 million in a ceremony here recently.
The money is the first installment on an expected total of nearly $25 million over the next five years.
The money will be used to support an array of mental health services.

The Quadrangle Becomes a Globe
In the late 1860's, when well-to-do American college students began to spend their junior year abroad and Europe also played host to struggling American artists, wandering expatriates and well-heeled sightseers on the grand tour, the novelist Henry James, who probably understood these footloose Americans better than anyone before or since, was asked to describe them.
"There is but one word to use -- vulgar, vulgar, vulgar!" he rumbled, explaining that he could not abide their ignorance and "perpetual reference of all things to some American standard or precedent."
James's novels took a kinder view, frequently emphasizing a noble quality in American character, but his ill-tempered putdown of his countrymen living abroad (reported by his brother) has echoed down through the decades.
Today, a growing number of American educators believe that the world is too small, too competititve and too dangerous to tolerate the sort of ignorant chauvinism that so provoked James.
The cure, they say, is not small, easy or cheap: American higher education needs to go global.
That does not mean lightheartedly dispatching students to sample cultural bonbons in exotic lands.
To serious-minded American educators, globalization means such things as the presence of large numbers of foreign students and professors on campuses in the United States, so that this fall at New York University's Washington Square campus, for example, more than 30 different languages are being spoken.
It means tens, ultimately hundrends of thousands of American students resident in foreign countries, mastering the local language and culture and -- as with present-day University of California students -- taking a full load of rigorous, faculty-screened courses taught in the native tongue at one of 100 institutions in 32 different countries.
It means internationalizing the curriculum, as in a course in accounting at the University of Michigan School of Business that now includes the study of Japanese regulations permitting the depreciation of assets at many times the rate allowed in the United States.
It means using the latest technology so that sudents at Ramapo College, a small, publicly supported institution in Mahwah, N.J., join in discussions with other students, scholars, artists and officials around the world in 120 teleconferences every year.
"International education is not a new idea, but the times have now conjoined to make it dominant," said L. Jay Oliva, the president of New York University, who has taken a leading role in the movement.
"What's happening here," he continued, "is comparable to what happened in the 19th century when Johns Hopkins University adopted the philosophy of the great German research universities and set the pattern for Harvard, Yale and the others."
The number of American student studying abroad has grown steadily over the last five years and is now at a record high of 72,000, according to the Institute of International Education, the nation's leading educational exchange organization.
This figure is small in comparison with the number of foreign students studying in the United States (438,000, or six times as many), but -- significantly -- the profile of these itinerant American students has changed.
"Typically, they used to be affluent women in their junior year at one of the elite Seven Sisters colleges and they would be studying architecture and French language in Paris," said Richard M. Krasno, president of the institute.
"But today more of them tend to be male, they are less likely to be affluent, they may be interested in business or industry and there's a slight shift away from Europe as their destination."
One conspicuous sign of the growth of international studies is the number of study-abroad programs now being offered.
Ranging from a business and economics course at the university of Hungary in Pecs to another concentrating on language and culture at the leading university in Hanoi, Vietnam, these programs have virtually doubled over the last decade, from 1,857 to 3,701.
Students are eagerly responding.
At an elite institution like Harvard University, 51 percent of the undergraduates participate in at least one work or study program abroad.
At Kalamazoo College, a small, selective liberal arts school in Kalamazoo, Mich., 85 percent of the students study overseas thanks to a private gift of more than $5 million that subsidizes travel and on-site living expenses.
A few American colleges and universities have not been satisfied with merely offering study-abroad programs but have adopted globalism as a fundamental objective for the entire institution.
Speaking for N.Y.U., Mr.
Oliva recently declared: "We plan to enter the next century as the quintessential global university. We will extend to every undergraduate the opportunity to study abroad as part of his or her N.Y.U. education, and we will become a center for global faculty inquiry and a center for worldwide conferences of university leaders."
Robert A. Scott, president of Ramapo College in New Jersey, said his institution aspired to be "a global college" for more practical reasons.
"We believe," he said, "that our graduates likely will either supervise or be supervised by someone of another race, ethnicity or nationality, and that their careers and lives as citizens will be affected by international and intercultural life."
Several American colleges and universities have established campuses in foreign countries so that students may spend extended periods abroad and earn credits readily accepted by employers and graduate schools in the United States.
Webster University in St.
Louis operates wholly owned branches in Geneva, London, Vienna and the Dutch city of Leiden.
Emerson College, a small liberal arts school in Boston, has established a branch in Maastricht, the Netherlands, where students study subjects such as global marketing, communications and advertising.
Some of these branches fare better than others; Japan, for example, has proved especially tricky for American institutions to penetrate.
Of the more than 20 American branches established in Japan in recent years, at least 9 have failed, most recently a Texas A &amp; M branch in Koriyama.
All are said to have been victims of the economic recession in Japan and the unexpected difficulty of recruiting Japanese students.
But if it has not always been easy to attract foreign students to American compuses overseas, foreign students have for years flocked to attend colleges and universities in the United States.
In fact, according to the Department of Commerce, the 438,000 foreign students currently resident in the United States, while only a small fraction of the total enrollment of 14.5 million, have fed a major and all-but-hidden export industry bringing some $6 billion annual to the American economy.
The cohort of foreign students has kept growing steadily at the rate of about 4.5 percent a year for the past two decades.
Quite often, these students become leaders in their societies at home.
Chang-Lin Tien, chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, said he recently attended a state reception in Seoul, South Korea, at which no fewer than seven Cabinet ministers introduced themselves to him as Berkeley graduates.
"That's typical," Chancellor Tien remarked.
"I get the same greetings in Indonesia and Singapore."
The reasons for all of this activity are many.
The first and most important is the rise of the global economy.
Alert, job-oriented students have come to realize that as the world shrinks, many of the best jobs are going to go to college graduates who possess international skills.
For example, after graduating from Wellesley College in 1987, Cynthia Jeffers taught English for two years in Japan under a program run by the Ministry of Education.
She then returned to the United States, entered the Harvard Business School and upon her graduation last June landed a job as an associate in the corporate finance department of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, one of the major brokerage firms on Wall Street.
Her experience in Japan, she said, greatly increased her prospects in the job market.
Another stimulus for globalization is that most financial aid for students has recently become "portable," as college officials like to say.
In the past, vaguely worded Federal statutes authorizing financial aid for college students -- Pell grants, Stafford loans and the like -- made many student advisers hesitant to recommend the use of these grants overseas.
Stephen Cooper, the director of academic programs abroad at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, said that he and a group of associates successfully lobbied Congress to make every form of Federal aid for students applicable for study overseas.
The new explicit language appears in the Higher Education Act of 1992.
"Judging from the number of inquiries I've received from around the country, this is having a big impact," said Professor Cooper.
Still another spur is the development and prevalence of new communications technology that allows educators to leap oceans and cross borders with impunity.
B.
Joseph White, dean of the University of Michigan Business School and a pioneer in the field educators now call "distance learning," has taken the new technology a step further.
Last year Dean White set up a program sponsored by Cathay Pacific, the national airline of Hong Kong, that employs interactive television to link M.B.A. candidates in Hong Kong with professors at Ann Arbor.
"It's actually a complex teaching system because we don't believe we can provide the quality we want with interactive TV alone," said Dean White.
"Consequently, we send our faculty to Hong Kong and bring their students here for face-to-face meetings."
"It's the future," he continued.
"Our pilot project for Cathay Pacific carries with it a vast productivity potential."
Another reason for the growth of interest in globalization is that travel abroad, like hit shows on Broadway, has good word of mouth.
"It's a cliche, but over and over you hear students saying 'It changed my life!' " said Dr.
Krasno.
It is a point confirmed by Corbin Smith, the director of Stanford University's Overseas Study Office.
"When we surveyed the senior class here over the last few years," Mr.
Smith said, "asking what was the most meaningful experience during their undergraduate years, more than 87 percent of those who participated in a Stanford study-abroad program gave that the highest rating."
Not everyone is so enthusiastic.
Roger Kimball, the neoconservative author of "Tenured Radicals," which takes a skeptical look at academia, observes that colleges are "making out like bandits" by collecting full tuition from students and "placing them at a fraction of that cost at overseas institutions."
It is true that the ranks of foreign students in the United States have been swollen not only by the quality of colleges here but also by sharp-eyed admissions officials who have successfully recruited well-heeled foreign students when they were unable to fill their campuses with enough American students able to pay the ever-rising tuition costs.
In fact, unregulated overseas recruitment proved so easy -- and profitable -- that a few years ago unscrupulous hucksters began to recruit foreign students for small community colleges in the United States with misleading promises that after a year or two the student could transfer into Harvard or M.I.T.
Today, some professional organizations have adopted generally effective guidelines and codes of ethics to substantially reduce such misrepresentations.
And some critics, like Mr. Kimball, say there is a great
Continued on Page 31  Continued from Page 26  deal of wishful thinking in the notion that "a semester abroad is going to make one into an internationalist."
Holly M. Carter, dean of the office of educational opportunity programs at Northeastern University, argues that the belief that today's college students are more culturally aware than their predecessors is a comforting myth that ignores "the increase in hate crimes, blatant bigotry and racism on the campuses."
But educational leaders like Mr.
Oliva of N.Y.U. argue that a global perspective is vital to the international community.
"There are at least three factors driving the globalization of education today," he said.
"The first is purely serendipitous: We're on the cusp of a new wave of immigration." (About a million immigrants have come to New York over the past decade, many of whom have attended N.Y.U.)
"Second," he continued, "people realize that the more different environments you move into, the more you learn. Conversely, the more you study with people just like yourself, the less you learn.
"I realize in my own life that I never learned more than when I was overseas for a year and a half. Everything became very vivid. There was no moment when I could let my mind relax. And gradually, I discovered that I could master change."
"And third," Mr.
Oliva said, "the demise of the Soviet Union has made Americans more international than ever. It made us realize that the Soviet Union had been a major force in policing ethnic rivalries. The world got capped under big cloaks. We used to think of the division between Northern and Southern Ireland, and what's happening in Yemen, as anomalies. Now we see them as the rule.
"In the future," he continued, "we probably face 30 to 40 years of instability and border wars like the 19th century, but with one frightening difference -- small nations possessing immensely destructive weapons. So our job in international education is to help provide a global environment in which these ethnic disputes can be handled on the basis of intellectual discourse and debate, not war."
John Markham, director of the University of California's Education Abroad Program, says, "The question I like to ask is: Should the University of California have a foreign policy?"
Most educators acknowledge that the vast majority of American faculty and students are still relatively insular, but they are optimistic that economic forces will prevail.
"The sea change will occur," Dr.
Krasno said, "when the global economy drives corporate leaders to say they want to hire people with foreign language skills and knowledge of foreign cultures, and that all things being equal they will hire them first. That's when the rush will begin."


Oct.2-Nov.5: 20 Rounds Fired; White House Shooting Brings Lesser Charges
More clues emerged about why a dishonorably discharged Army medic spoiled a splendid afternoon a week ago Saturday when he took a semi-automatic assault rifle and fired more than 20 rounds at the White House.
But by the end of last week, the authorities had not decided whether to accuse Francisco M. Duran of trying to assassinate the President, which could carry a sentence of life in prison.
Mr.
Duran, a 26-year-old upholsterer at a Rocky Mountain resort, was charged with four lesser counts, including destruction of Government property and illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.


Ticketmaster's Mr. Tough Guy
PERHAPS the only thing not in rancorous dispute in the ticketing business these days is this: ticketmaster wanted the business and Ticketmaster got the business.
In the pugnacious world of selling entertainment and sports tickets, Ticketmaster is the winner and still ambitious champion.
It is the company that figured out how to sell tickets quickly by phone and at retail outlets.
It cultivated the music industry and other contacts so that it would have tickets to sell.
It then bound the stadiums, halls and other sites to long-term exclusive contracts that kept rivals out in the cold.

Down and Out in the City
BETTER that Vladimir and Estragon did not move.
Had Beckett's vagabond clowns decided Godot was no longer worth the wait, they might have wound up on a bench in Tompkins Square Park, New York City, where neighborhood kids burn live pigeons for sport and people -- families full -- from other neighborhoods, even the suburbs, stop by to roll the sleeping bums.
They would have names like Sasha and Flea.
They'd be drinking nitrate (spiked with Sterno), warming their hands by setting a fire in a garbage can and fighting over whether one stole $7 from the other.


POSTINGS: Co-op Council Conference; The Usual, Plus Crime
The brochure for the Council of New York Cooperatives 14th annual housing conference next Sunday is filled with the usual seminars and workshops: "Preventing Pigeon Problems," "Lobby Renovations" and "Challenges in Mortgage Refinancing."
Because of the recent scandal involving vendors' paying kickbacks to managing agents, however, several of the 76 courses look like something from a police academy catalog.
"Preventing Fraud and Kickbacks" is an example.
"Detecting and Curtailing Criminal Activities" is another.
"It is the thing that is new this year, and it is concerning a lot of people," said Marc Luxemburg, a lawyer and president of the council.
"It's certainly emerged as the current topic of the moment."
The conference is being held from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. at Hunter College in Manhattan.
Preregistration is required.
The cost is $60 a person for those living in co-ops or condominiums that are members of the Council of New York Cooperatives and $85 for professionals affiliated with the organization.
For others, the cost is $150.
Some discounted tickets are also available.

First Marathon Is Next Step in Quest to Break Out of Life's Routines
There she was at last, rising over the crest of Holly Hill Road with the sun beating down on her.
She was a new marathoner completing her longest workout, the symbolic 20-miler.
And looming next was the big event in New York.
Virginia McDonald, 44 years old, of Marlboro, N.J., finished the run with a steady stride.
Her cheeks were caked with the salt of sweat, the marathoner's badge of honor.
She wore a T-shirt inscribed "Virginia," which she planned to wear today, race day.


On the Ballot: Should Planning Commission Rule on Trees?
AMONG decisions that the electorate faces in the voting booth on Tuesday is a referendum on clear-cutting trees on county property.
The proposal, which has already been unanimously approved by the county's Board of Legislators and signed by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, would require approval from the county's Planning Board for any clear-cutting of trees on county property.
Because the legislation would be an amendment to the County Charter, it requires voter approval.
A similar measure -- an ordinance, not an amendment -- already requires the approval of the county's Parks, Recreation and Conservation Board before clear-cutting trees on county parkland only.
That ordinance has been signed into law by Mr.
O'Rourke.


Voting Isn't Pretty, but Somebody Has to Do It

U.S. Seeks to Increase Lost-Bag Compensation
The Department of Transportation has proposed raising the limit on compensation to consumers for baggage that is damaged or lost by a United States airline.
The new limit is $1,850 per passenger, a 48 percent increase from the $1,250 limit that was set 10 years ago.
If approved by Congress, the change could become effective by the end of the year.


... And the Kitchen Goes Electronic
A TELEVISION MONITOR SHOWS two dancers leaping past each other, then moving together to whirl around in a circle, their bodies seemingly melting into one.
But this is not a taped concert with special effects: each woman is actually dancing at the same moment on a stage hundreds of miles from her partner.
A composer plays one of her works on a keyboard in New York, and the keys move on a piano across the continent in Santa Monica, Calif., so people there can hear her fingering on an actual instrument.
"It's as if my arms were 3,000 miles long," she comments.


Columbia Steps Back After 2 Steps Ahead
For longer than Columbia fans care to remember, even the best football seasons were of the one-step forward, two-steps back variety.
In what has been the Lions' winningest season since 1971, it has become two steps forward and one step back.
With more chances than it deserved to tie it or pull ahead, Columbia couldn't muster a victory today at Memorial Field against an injury-riddled Dartmouth team, falling by 14-13.


What's Fair for Childless Workers?
To the Editor:
Leslie Lafayette sounds like those who complain that handicapped parking spots give an advantage to persons with disabilities.
The cases she cites of employees given perks for their children are extremely rare; in most cases, workers lose money and chances at promotion each time an earache, school conference or snow day causes them to lose work time.
Further, her perspective on property tax is unrealistic: she is not paying tax to send our children to school; we all are paying to educate future citizens.

Putting a New Face On an Old Slovak City
ONE of the favorite cities of the Hapsburgs' Queen Maria Theresa and capital of Hungary from 1541 to 1784, Bratislava is often forgotten on the revived tourist route of Eastern Europe.
But this is perhaps unjust treatment for a metropolis where the Mayor, Peter Kresani, is an architectural historian intent on insuring that restoration takes place and is done authentically.
Mayor Kresani recently revealed a 20-year plan for the city that restricts the historical inner core to buildings of only several stories in height, placing high-rises on the outskirts.

Danny De Vito: Center of the Universe?
Almost everyone considers Michael Ovitz the most powerful man in Hollywood.
But did his name come up in connection with "Pulp Fiction," a movie that some say transformed movie making?
We think not.
Instead, it can be argued that Danny DeVito is not only the most powerful man in Hollywood but also the center of the universe.
Through this actor-director-producer-beautician, anyone could theoretically get to anyone else.
Producing, through his company Jersey Films, has made Mr.
DeVito's reach all encompassing.
The company's productions run the gamut of subjects (and studios) from "Hoffa" (20th Century Fox) to "Reality Bites" (Universal) to "Pulp Fiction" (Miramax).
Next up: "Get Shorty" (MGM), starring John Travolta and "Feeling Minnesota" (New Line Cinema), starring Keanu Reeves.
Mr.
DeVito will also direct "Matilda," based on the Roald Dahl children's book, for Universal.
Here's how Mr.
DeVito Links up to the universe.
JOSH YOUNG GRAMMY WINNERS
Mr.
DeVito appeared in "Ruthless People" with Bette Midler, opened for Barbra Streisand at a benefit for Bill Clinton and was born in Asbury Park, N.J., the town Bruce Springsteen put on the map.
PEOPLE WITH TELEVISIONS
Nearly everyone remembers Mr.
DeVito from the series "Taxi." "People pat me on the back, and say, 'Hey, how are Rhea and the kids?"' Mr.
DeVito said.
Anyone deprived of "Taxi" has certainly been to "Cheers," where Mr.
DeVito's real-life wife, Rhea Periman, served drinks as Carla.
WORLD LEADERS (INCLUDING MICHAEL OVITZ)
In "Junior," which opens on Nov. 26, an airline flight attendant (played by Judy Ovitz, wife of Michael Ovitz) tries to eject the DeVito character from the First-class cabin.
"Let's face it, Danny knows everyone," says Ivan Reitman, the film's director.
Also co-starring: Emma Thompson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Kennedy spouse and head of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports during the Bush Administration.
GENERATION X
For a 50-year-old, Mr.
DeVito has impeccable credentials with 20-somethings.
"Reality Bits," directed by Ben Stiller, 28, and written by Helen Childress, 24, is known as the definitive Gen-X movie.
If not for Mr.
DeVito and his partner, Michael Shamberg, backing this film, the revival of the Knack's hit "My Sharona" might be years away.
ALUMNI OF THE WILFRED ACADEMY OF HAIR AND BEAUTY CULTURE
The Wilfred Academy once had 58 branches in the New York area.
After completing his studies in Asbury Park in 1964, Mr.
DeVito got his beautician's license and practiced at his sister's salon.
Told that all Wilfred outlets are now closed, Mr.
DeVito sheepishly admitted, "I haven't kept up with my alma mater." NEW HOLLYWOOD
Jersey Films has made movies at nearly every studio except its home base, Columbia Pictures, so it shouldn't be surprising if the company gets a film going with the new studio formed by Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg, and David Geffen.
During Mr.
Katzenberg's reign at Walt Disney Studios, Mr.
DeVito starred in three Disney films: "Tin Men," "Ruthless People" and "Renaissance Man." OLD HOLLYWOOD
Mr.
DeVito's first turn on the golf course was with Jack Nicholson, a close friend since they appeared together in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest " (1975).
"I played 18 holes my first time out, and I lost every ball in Jack's bag," Mr.
DeVito said.
"Michael" -- Michael Douglas, a pal since the 70's and a collaborator on four DeVito films -- "is a golf enthusiast too, but I'm not getting out there with him." Mr.
Nicholson's best friend is Warren Beatty.
QUENTIN TARANTINO
Since the critical success of "Pulp Fiction," Quentin Tarantino is a universe unto himself.
Three years ago, Stacey Sher, president of Jersey Films, slipped Mr.
DeVito and Michael Shamberg the script for "Reservoir Dogs," then in production.
Jersey Films bought Mr.
Tarantino's next script, for "Pulp Fiction," sight unseen and was the executive producer of the film, distributed through Miramax.
"The only guidance you need to give a guy that talented is what kind of lenses to use," Mr.
DeVito said.


In Poignant Public Letter, Reagan Reveals That He Has Alzheimer's
Former President Ronald Reagan said today that he had entered the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, an incurable brain ailment that steadily destroys memory and eventually leads to death.
In a handwritten letter to the American people, the 83-year-old Mr.
Reagan said he was in good health now, and while he maintained a positive tone, he did strike a fatalistic note.


THE ANGER: EVER DEEPER
One reason people are fed up with politics is that there is too much of it; everything has been politicized ("The Anger: Ever Deeper," Oct. 16).
The Lebanese composer and poet Marcel Khalife, who was recently in New York for a concert, put it very well when he said: "Culture is the only thing we have left to resist politics." He meant, of course, politics in the sense of "polarized contentiousness," not in the sense of the "art of compromise" (which seems to have been lost in Washington).

Perking Up Pasta With Wild Mushrooms
REMEMBER when the only mushrooms were cultivated whitecaps?
Now markets offer wild mushrooms: portobello, shiitake and oyster mushrooms, orange chanterelles and porcini.
Porcini are boletus mushrooms, also known as cepes, Polish mushrooms or Steinpilz.
They are good dried, too, but they need to be soaked in hot water or chicken broth for about half an hour.

Word for Word / Fashion Notes; Sweetie! The Zeitgeist Just Blew In. Tablecloth Chic and the Neo-Groovie
THERE are a few words designers do not want audiences to walk away thinking about after runway shows like those that just ended Friday for the 1995 spring and summer collections.
Those words are: shirts, trousers, dresses, jackets and shoes.
So every season, staging runway spectacles that cost almost $200,000, they attempt to direct observers' thinking a bit, by constructing a raison d'etre for their collections.
In their program notes, they philosophize on women's images, on their own role in forming those same images and on themselves (often in the third person, like royalty).
Although these notes are read only by jaded members of the fashion industry (and sometimes not even by them), there is always a pretense that the designer is addressing an idealized woman, the way Billy Joel might in one of his songs.


'Ewige Students'
Germans love to go to school.
It is not uncommon here to find someone well past 30 who is still an active university student and has no interest in leaving academe.
Over the years this German syndrome has become well known across Europe, and there is even a colloquial name for its victim -- the "ewige student," or the eternal student.


My Mentor, Barbie
Instead of throwing Barbie a 35th birthday party, feminists have been dissing the popular, petite plaything.
Yet far from being a bad role model, Barbie could be a modern girl's dream mentor.
O.K., so she does have the equivalent of a 16-inch waist.
Over the years, I still learned some very important life lessons from Barbie.
1.
Family Is Fundamental: Barbie's my age and, as the long-awaited only girl in a suburban clan of boys, I was Mattel's dream customer.
I had 68 Barbies who shared a pink plastic convertible car and split-level condominium, along with 12 Little Kiddles and 28 Dawn dolls so tiny that instead of changing their clothes I just switched their heads.


Oct.2-Nov.5; More Controversy for the N.E.A.
Spurred by $3 million in Congressional budget cuts, the National Endowment for the Arts has decided to assume more direct control of its grants.
Some arts groups complained that the new stance amounts to an effort to stifle those artists who are most likely to draw Congressional fire.
The N.E.A., which will still make awards to artists who apply directly to Washington, is eliminating the system that allows local arts groups to select individual artists for Federal funds.
The decision corresponds with a desire by the endowment's chairman, Jane Alexander, to increase accountability.
In August the National Arts Council, which oversees the N.E.A., vetoed grants to three controversial photographers.
Council members said they did not find the photographs very good, although the work of one photographer, Andres Serrano, is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.


'In Defense of Elitism'
To the Editor:
As a closet elitist and part-time Roger Kimball watcher, I was curious to see what Mr.
Kimball would make of "In Defense of Elitism." I can't say I'm surprised to find that his review wholeheartedly endorses William A. Henry 3d's condemnation of egalitarianism.


Depleted Army Has No Answers for Air Force Defense
Already handicapped by the loss of its best runner and two top quarterbacks with injuries, Army came into today's game against heavily favored Air Force without two other starters who have been suspended because of an incident involving Army players and female Cadets.
Split end Ron Thomas, Army's leading receiver with 23 catches; Mike Robinson, a starting halfback, and Devry Anderson, a defensive back, were disciplined for their part in a groping incident during an October pep rally.
Army did not release the identities of the players suspended from the team, citing Federal privacy rules, but a source confirmed that these three were not in uniform because they had been disciplined.

Karen Milbauer, Michael L. Wolfe
Karen Rachel Milbauer, a daughter of Nancy and Alan J. Milbauer of Wilmington, Del., was married last evening to Michael Lipton Wolfe, the son of Kathryn and Robert L. Wolfe of New Rochelle, N.Y.
Cantor Norman Swerling officiated at Congregation Beth Shalom in Wilmington.
Mrs.
Wolfe, 26, graduated from Tulane University.
She is an account executive with Nielsen North America, the research company, in New York.
Her father is the vice president of external affairs for Zeneca Pharmaceuticals in Wilmington.
Her mother is a guidance counselor at Avon Grove High School in Avondale, Pa.


The Bigger The Name, The Harder They Falter
On racing's day of days, with or without Holy Bull, the 11th Breeders' Cup series was spiced by D. Wayne Lukas when his horses won the Juvenile and the Juvenile Fillies, but had to settle for second place to Concern in the Classic.
But it was also a day of gyrating emotions that saw Lure and Sky Beauty run ninth, and Paradise Creek run third, in races they were expected to win.
The Europeans, with their largest delegation of 27 horses, took the Mile with Ireland's Barathea in a race that Lure was supposed to capture.
The Europeans also prevailed in the the Turf, with Tikkanen, in a race that Paradise Creek was supposed to win, and the 47-1 long shot One Dreamer won the Distaff in a race that Sky Beauty was supposed to win.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
Art on the Cutting Edge
WHEN the sculpturing tool is a chainsaw, mistakes can be costly.
"The chainsaw is unforgiving," Frank Bono said.
For art, and appendages.
Mr.
Bono, of East Northport, has been guarding his fingers while creating his art for three years.
That's how long he has been a chainsaw sculptor.
He takes Long Island dead trees and makes them works of art.
"I have a deal with a tree-service company," he said.
"They bring me their discards." Or he goes to the tree.
"Someone's got a stump," he said.
"They want to turn it into a bear.  I can do that."


Democrats On Defensive In a Handful Of Contests
The Democrats are on the defensive in a handful of contested legislative races around New York State this year, and while the Republicans could pick up seats in both the Assembly and the Senate, the gains would not upset the balance of power in either house and seem unlikely to have any sway in the death-penalty debate.
In the Assembly, where 100 of the 150 members are Democrats, officials from both parties estimate that the majority could lose up to seven or eight seats, though it will probably be fewer.
In the Senate, where 35 of the 61 members are Republicans, both parties have concentrated efforts on two tough races in the Rochester area currently held by Democrats.


Sizing Up Airline Seating
IF you were crammed into economy-class seats all summer with the rest of us, you discovered airlines are no more generous with their leg room than with their peanuts.
There may be an inch of hope on the horizon in the new twin-jet Boeing 777, but don't hold your breath: The 777 will not make a commercial debut until next summer, and it is a protean plane, one with an interior that can be rearranged quickly, so what you see on the charts may not be what you get.
Seating in the main cabins of major United States airlines continues to get tighter as competition intensifies.
As John McDonald, a spokesman for Trans World Airlines said, schedule and price are the bottom line for air travelers, and extra space will attract new customers only when bottom lines are equal.
"The market won't support it," Mr.
McDonald said.
"Comfort is one thing everyone talks about, but you still see 300 people crowded aboard a charter 727 to San Juan." This would be more than twice the capacity on a scheduled flight.


A Patriotic Pitch: Honda Is American
FOR years, the Big Three auto companies and the United Automobile Workers have tried to make patriotism part of the car-buying mentality of Americans.
As a marketing pitch, the effect of showroom jingoism has always been debatable -- so has its economic logic.
Still, the idea that driving a Chevy or a Chrysler is a patriotic act, while owning a Honda or a Toyota is not, clearly appealed to some.
And in their lobbying efforts and in their advertising, Detroit has long argued that buying American-made cars is good for the American economy and that buying imported cars is bad.


Campaign Refrain: 'My Opponent's a Hypocrite'
Politically embarrassed by disclosures that they had both employed undocumented household workers, Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Michael Huffington traded new charges of hypocrisy today as each struggled to regain campaign momentum in California's most vituperative Senate race in years.
At a rally here with cheering campaign workers, Ms.
Feinstein, the Democratic incumbent, called Mr.
Huffington, a native of Texas, a carpetbagger "who doesn't give a whit about California." She then accused him of "running lies" about her and her problems with the immigration issue.


The Very Quiet Behemoth of the Philanthropic World
THOUGH other philanthropies are better known, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute is actually the leviathan of the nonprofit world, and C. F. (Terry) Wolfe is the man who minds the money.
No wonder he keeps a pie-sized Bayer aspirin on his desk.
"You just have to cross out the zeros," he said.
Otherwise, he has discovered, "you'd lose perspective."


Marathon Stories Almost Outnumber the Runners
As they stream by his Brooklyn church today, the Rev.
David Dyson says he will honor the New York Marathon runners from the pulpit, summoning Isaiah's prophecy that the young shall run and not be weary.
But he will also read from the first verse of the 12th chapter of Hebrews, in which Paul speaks of runners being surrounded "by a great cloud of witnesses."
It is this verse that inspired the mural surrounding the inside of the church, which depicts "a cloud" of neighborhood folks from street people to firefighters to a kilt-wearing chap playing a bagpipe to, yes, runners in sweats.


Helping Immigrants Get Help: A One-Stop-Shopping Approach
Yvonne J. Graham understands a few things about providing health care for immigrants that many doctors may not.
She knows that they often do not seek it out, because they are afraid that if they are undocumented, they are not entitled to services.
And she is well aware that many of them go to a doctor only after they have exhausted the supposed healing power of plant extracts or leaves.


THE DAWN OF SIMNEWS
The St.
Louis Post-Dispatch has been writing capsules of three Cardinals' championship seasons since opening day, when only a moderately talented seer could have predicted a midseason halt (Word &amp; Image: "The Dawn of SimNews," by Max Frankel, Oct. 2).
Further, The Post-Dispatch carried capsule histories of other noteworthy Cardinals teams, in 1992 and 1993.
It is inaccurate for The Times to suggest that we started this feature because of the strike or that the newspaper, to use Frankel's unfortunate turn of phrase, "feigned excitement over classic games of the past." EDWARD H. KOHN Senior Correspondent St.

THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE VOTERS Undecided in New York; For Many Voters, No Choice Is Satisfying
With just a few days until the election, about 1 in every 10 likely voters in New York State remain undecided about whom to support in the governor's race.
These voters could, in theory, decide the election if they were to swing heavily into one candidate's camp.
The undecideds include Republican die-hards and disenchanted Democrats, people from New York City and remote regions upstate -- all torn between a Governor whom many could no longer abide and challengers they were not comfortable with, either.


A Woman's False Accusation Pains Many Blacks
As racial hoaxes go, the lies Susan Smith told in Union, S.C., about a black man stealing her two children were not novel or new, but they shot around the world anyway as the gospel truth spoken by a grieving mother.
Now, with the news that Mrs.
Smith has confessed to killing her own offspring comes a different kind of grief -- a weary, when-will-it-ever-end sadness.


Out and About
In the tradition of this country's great documentary photographers, Nancy Andrews, a photographer at The Washington Post, illuminates a part of American culture too often hidden from most people's view.
Ms.
Andrews's sensitive, stirring collection of 70 black-and-white photographs with accompanying oral histories, FAMILY: A Portrait of Gay and Lesbian America (HarperSanFrancisco, paper, $25), is an important record of 20th-century gay life and a joy to read.
From the conventional to the outlandish, Ms.
Andrews portrays an extraordinary range of subjects: a World War II veteran, shyly proud in his American Legion cap; the pastor of the Full Truth Unity Fellowship of Christ Church, singing a gospel song, eyes closed in ecstasy; a cowboy, muscular and self-assured, who rides on the gay rodeo circuit; a lesbian garden club in Georgia called the Digging Dykes of Decatur; even a Mardi Gras "krewe" or club, featuring transvestites in Las Vegas-style beaded costumes.
Though the more eccentric photos grab attention, the substance of the book lies in its soulful depiction of people as simply themselves.
Ms.
Andrews's portraits are filled with texture and natural light and reveal a skillful photographer who makes her subjects comfortable.
The text conveys each person's story and manner of speaking, and varies from rambling to eloquent.
"Family" affirms gay men and lesbians in all their diversity, while widening the reader's image of what a family can be.

Last Call for Getting In the Spring Bulbs
WHY do today what can surely be done next week?
This sort of procrastination is typical of gardeners.
Inspired by a few weeks of beautiful mild weather, they postpone those inevitable chores, particularly bulb planting.
But the weeks move along with amazing speed and there are no surer reminders than the early-fading light of fall days and the page-turning of the trusty calendar that winter is on its way.
With it will come frozen soil and snow.
So good gardeners, do be sporting and carry on.
Even a traditional deadline for planting tulips -- Election Day -- is on the horizon.


Running Around the Country (Literally) and Other Marathon Tales
The world's first marathoner didn't get to enjoy the fruits of victory for very long.
Legend has it that in 490 B.C., Pheidippides ran 25 miles from a battlefield at Marathon to tell the Greeks in Athens that they had defeated the Persians.
Once the message was delivered, the tuckered-out runner promptly dropped dead.
Training methods and medical care have improved in the past two and a half millennia, so the vast majority of the runners lined up in Staten Island this morning at the start of the New York City Marathon should be able to proclaim their own victories: I won; I improved my time; I made it.
Their trek through the five boroughs of New York will mark the 25th time the city's marathon has been run.
Although it isn't the oldest marathon and it isn't the most grueling, it can boast that it provides the world's longest urinal for the world's largest starting group of runners.
Boasting rights for other marathons as well as some odder incidents in the history of the sport, are noted at right.
ANNE CRONIN WORLD'S OLDEST MARATHON -- The modern Olympic games, which began in 1896, included a 40-kilometer (24.85-mile) marathon.
It was won by Spiridon Loues of Greece, with a 2:58:50 time.
OLDEST IN U.S. -- The Boston Marathon, first run 1897, is the world's oldest annual marathon.
Members of the Boston Athletic Association had attended the 1896 Olympic games and decided to start a marathon in Boston.
The race, then 24.7 miles, was won by John J. McDermott in 2:55:10, although he walked several times during the final miles.
GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT -- John A. Kelley ran the Boston Marathon 61 straight years, from 1931 to 1992.
He won twice, in 1935 and 1945, and came in second seven times.
In one of his runner-up runs, Mr.
Kelley tapped Ellison "Tarzan" Brown, then leading, as he passed him.
This riled Mr.
Brown, who redoubled his efforts and went on to win.
The spot of the tap was called "Heartbreak Hill" in The Boston Globe the next day.
The name stuck.
HOW THE MARATHON GOT ITS LENGTH -- Marathons were generally 40 kilometers long until the 1908 Olympics in London.
Princess Mary, who was the official starter for the race, asked whether the starting line could be moved to Windsor Castle, so her children could watch from the nursey windows.
This extended the course to 26 miles, 385 yards to the finish line.
The longer "London" distance was adopted as the standard in 1924.
PLEASE DON'T USE THE BUSHES -- The world's largest urinal will be installed at the start of the New York City Marathon in Staten Island.
The 290-foot facility will be located at the Fort Wadsworth Naval Station along with 350 portable toilets.
Another 200 portable toilets will be placed along the route.
A CAST OF THOUSANDS -- This year, more than 27,000 runners will be competing in the New York City Marathon, which could break its own record for most starters -- 28,656 in 1992.
The London Marathon is the second largest, with 25,194 this year.
SHOELESS ABEBE -- The 1960 Rome Olympic marathon was won by an Ethiopian who had never run a marathon outside Addis Ababa.
Abebe Bikila ran barefoot and won with a record time of 2:15:16.2.
He was also the first man to ever win consecutive Olympic marathons, finishing the race in Toyko with another record time of 2:12:11.2, despite having had an appendectomy a month before.
He wore shoes the second time around.
GOLD STANDARD -- The record for Olympic marathon wins is two, shared by Mr.
Bikila (1960, 1964) and Waldemar Cierpinski of East Germany (1976, 1980).
Grete Waltz of Norway won in New York nine times (1978-80, 1982-86, 1988).
WOMEN'S FIRSTS -- The first woman officially entered in a marathon was Violet Percy of Great Britain, who ran the 1926 London Marathon in 3:40:22.
The first championship marathon for women was held by the Road Runners Club of America in 1970.
Women's Olympic marathons began in 1984.
LONG HAULS -- The longest marathon races ever were the 1920's transcontinental runs from Los Angeles to New York City.
Andy Payne ran 3,422 miles in 1928 with a time of 573:04:34.
Johnny Salo won the 1929 version of 3,665 miles in 525:57:2, for an average of 6.97 miles per hour.
The longest annual race is Australia's Westfield Run.
The record for the 658 miles was set by Yiannis Kouros of Greece in 1989; 5 days, 2 hours, 27 minutes, 27 seconds.
The longest individual run on record was Sara Covington-Fulcher's lap around the United States, starting and finishing in Los Angeles.
The 11,134 miles took from July 21, 1987, to Oct. 2, 1988, to cover.

World Group to Debate Plan To Protect Species by Numbers
As conservation authorities from around the world meet in Florida starting on Monday to review the treaty protecting imperiled species from excessive commercial trade, they face an especially heated debate over how to decide which species deserve protection.
In the past, restrictions over importing and exporting tigers, rhinoceroses, orchids, parrots and the like have been imposed one species at a time, using a variety of justifications under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.


Scores of Students Take Up Acupuncture at Center in Syosset
IN a classroom on a Saturday morning a man lay on a table with his shirt open and about 12 needles protruding from the face and chest.
A second young man leaned over and carefully inserted an additional needle through a plastic tube into the chest while their teacher watched.
"The angle is not quite right," the teacher, Dr.
Chi Chou, said.
"It should be pointed outward, in the direction of the meridian."


26 Miles for the 25th Year: There's No Stopping the Marathon Now
On race day in the mid-1980's, Allan Steinfeld received an alarming telephone call 50 minutes before the New York City Marathon was to begin.
The police had made an arrest along the course in Queens after drugs were found in 55-gallon drums, and law enforcement officials had blocked the road to anyone in a car or on foot.
Steinfeld, then the assistant race director, relayed this message: In less than two hours, 23,000 runners would be descending upon Queens.
The law enforcement officials could either move or be trampled.
They moved.


Lojack in New York City: Car G8L54 Where Are You?
LOJACK has come to New York City and southern New York State: The electronic tracking system, which helps the police to find stolen vehicles, went into operation in mid-June in the five boroughs and in Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Putnam, Rockland and Orange Counties.
The Lojack premise is straightforward.
Car owners pay a dealer $595 (or less) to have a radio transceiver about the size of a chalkboard eraser hidden in their cars; there are no monthly monitoring fees.
A reply code of five letters and numbers -- each car has a different code -- is paired with the vehicle identification number in police computers.
Lojack donates the hardware that makes the system work to state and local police; the company declines to say how many units have been distributed, or how many cars are equipped with Lojack.

Paramount Center: Like Old Times
FINANCIAL constraints have forced the Paramount Center for the Arts to curtail its concert presentations, so only nine events are scheduled through the end of this year.
Because several of those attractions are clustered next weekend, it will be like old times in Peekskill for a few days.
Heading the list is the singer Bobby McFerrin.
Nobody, including Mr.
McFerrin himself, has been able to explain how he produces the myriad sounds that shape his improvisations, but his performances Thursday and Friday at 8 P.M. will be recorded for CD release.


World Markets; Depository Receipts: Now, the World
BACK in the 1920's, a group of investors in the United States invented the American Depository Receipt as a way of making it easier for them to register their purchases of foreign stocks and collect their dividends.
Instead of having to appear in person in some foreign capital to go through the formalities, as laws in most nations required, the investors paid a bank to hold the securities there, collect the dividend and send it on to them.
Over the decades, the concept grew to encompass trading of A.D.R.'s, denominated in dollars, again to avoid the difficulties of actually buying and selling the underlying shares on foreign markets.
Foreign companies eventually discovered the advantages of broadening their shareholder base in the United States, and actively encouraged investors to hold A.D.R.'s.


Journal; Double Trouble
Those of us who live a safe distance from Virginia and California are probably having too much fun arguing the No. 1 election-eve question over dinner: Who would be scarier, Senator Oliver North or Senator Michael Huffington?
It's a deliciously down-to-the-wire debate.
Just when it seemed that Mr.
North, a convicted felon who got off on technicalities, would be the clear winner on the grounds of proven criminality, Mr.
Huffington had to go and admit that he, too, may have violated Federal law by employing an undocumented nanny.
Both men have a special talent for blaming others for their own misdeeds -- Congress in Mr.
North's case, his wife in Mr.
Huffington's -- and both men are outspending every other candidate in the country to sell themselves in ads rather than face questions for which their handlers cannot supply answers in advance.

Labor Development Institute Has Never Taken C.I.A. Money
To the Editor:
Your Oct. 30 news article on United States involvement 30 years ago in British Guiana mentions the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s American Institute for Free Labor Development.
It says that "in the 1950's and early 1960's, former United States intelligence officers say, the C.I.A. slipped money to the institute."


The Splendor and Ingenuity of Unabashed Flattery
JUST IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T HAD A  good opportunity to feel inferior lately, in case you haven't had to go on an interview or a Big Date with bags under your eyes or an ill-concealed pimple, a show has arrived to restore you to the common fellowship: "Masterpieces of Hollywood Photography: Photographs From the Private Collection of John Kobal" at the James Danziger Gallery in SoHo.
The great beauties of the screen (sleek Garbo, exalted Dietrich, luscious Rita Hayworth), some of the great handsomes (Coop, suave and brooding; Gable, before a mustache gave him definition and virility), and even one of the great dogs (Lassie, to be precise) are here magnified to the status of miracles, the ne plus ultra not so much of human as of photographic life.
The only really appropriate response to these pictures is either to go down on your knees or to swoon, but since both are rather out of date, a little skeptical admiration will do.


Living It Up in Later Years
IT is a happy time at Stage II of the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven where four actors -- Jim Dale, Brian Murray, Martin Rayner and Tom Beckett -- are playing more than 20 parts, including the eccentric dowager extraordinaire, Augusta Bertram.
The occasion is Graham Greene's "Travels With My Aunt," which has been adapted for the stage.
Sort of.
Graham Greene, who died at the age of 86 in 1991, is best known for his novels -- "Brighton Rock," "The Power and the Glory," "The Heart of the Matter" and "The Third Man" -- 24 in all.
The political and the theological were his dominant themes (Greene called himself "a Catholic atheist") but he was as acknowledged for what he termed "entertainments" -- works of suspense and intrigue -- as for his concerns with conscience and spirituality.


The New York Vote: Candidates on the Issues
The political races of '94 are almost run, and along the way, the candidates have spoken hundreds of thousands of words -- in speeches, debates, mailings and advertisements.
Often, though, dialogue on the issues of governing has been overshadowed by discussion of other matters, some substantive, others less so.


SUNDAY: November 6, 1994; Last of the Cigar Store Indians
Another fading tobacco symbol is the painted wooden Indian.
At the turn of the century nearly every cigar store had one, but only a few thousand are left, of which about 60 (some pictured above) are owned by Mark Goldman, a Manhattan tobacco wholesaler and retailer.
"I grew up in the tobacco business and fell in love with them," says Goldman, who buys, sells and trades the carved figures.
They are not all Indians.
Goldman has carvings of a baseball player and a Scotsman.
The statues, of all types, range in value from about $5,000 to $90,000.

The High Price of Free Excellence
THE poster-crammed bulleting boards, grubily clad undergraduates mingling in clumps and scent of old dust mixed with fresh paint bring to mind any of a hundred urban campuses.
But this isn't just any campus.
The students, a potpourri of races and ethnic groups, are among the most talented in America, and the curriculum is among the most demanding.
More striking, the only barrier to entry is the fierce competition for places in the freshman class.
For this is Cooper Union, a specialized college of art, architecture and engineering in Greenwich Village and the only private American college of its caliber that charges no tuition.


Races in Connecticut for Governor, Other Statewide Offices and Congress
GOVERNOR  CANDIDATES
WILLIAM E. CURRY JR., 42, Democrat.
State Comptroller since 1990, lawyer, State Senator from 1979-83, ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 1982, former political director of Freeze Voter, the political arm of the nuclear-freeze movement.
EUNICE S. GROARK, 56, A Connecticut Party.
A one-time Republican, Lieutenant Governor since 1990 when she ran on the third-party ticket of Gov.
Lowell P. Weicker.
Lawyer, corporation counsel for Hartford from 1987-90, and a Hartford City Councilwoman from 1981-85.
JOHN G. ROWLAND, 37, Republican.
Congressman from Waterbury from 1985-91, barely lost the 1990 race for governor, member of House Armed Services Committee.
Consultant since 1990 for several military contractors based in Connecticut.
TOM SCOTT, 36, radio talk-show host, State Senator from 1981-1991, led anti-income tax movement in 1991, ran unsuccessfully for United States House of Representatives in 1990 and 1992.
THE ISSUES
The state income tax, imposed in 1991, has been the central issue.
Mr.
Rowland and Mr.
Scott promise to scrap it without raising other taxes.
Mrs.
Groark would not change the income tax, and Mr.
Curry wants to keep it and economize elsewhere to provide money to cities and towns to cut property taxes.
All candidates have called for expanded efforts to reduce crime, and all four favor the death penalty.
Mrs.
Groark has been attacked over the Weicker administration's policy of giving tax breaks and cash incentives to attract and retain companies, an approach she favors.
Mr.
Rowland and Mr.
Scott says tax cuts would do more for the economy than such incentives.
Mr.
Curry would shift economic assistance to smaller companies.
ANALYSIS
Mr.
Rowland has been the front-runner since the campaign began, and has had a large advantage in financing, spending much of his money on television commercials.
But Mr.
Scott, who appeals to many of the same conservatives, has drawn off some support, and many voters, particularly women, have been troubled by Mr.
Rowland's efforts to suppress a police report on a domestic dispute with his ex-wife in April.
After a surprise primary victory, Mr.
Curry has campaigned aggressively, but in a close race he may lose critical votes to Mrs.
Groark.
OTHER STATE RACES  (x denotes incumbents)
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR M. Jodi Rell, Republican; Joseph P. Ganim, Democrat; Audrey Rowe, A Connecticut Party; Glen R. O'Keefe, independent
TREASURER Christopher Burnham, Republican; Joseph M. Suggs, Democrat (X)
COMPTROLLER Gene Gavin, Republican; Nancy Wyman, Democrat, A Connecticut Party
ATTORNEY GENERAL Richard Arnold, Republican; Richard Blumenthal, Democrat, A Connecticut Party (X)
SECRETARY OF THE STATE Andrea Scott, Republican; Miles S. Rapoport, Democrat, A Connecticut Party UNITED STATES SENATE  CANDIDATES
GERALD LABRIOLA, 62, Republican, retired pediatrician, State Senator from 1981-83, ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 1982 and for the Republican nomination for governor in 1982 and 1986.
JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN, 52, Democrat, United States Senator since 1991; State Attorney General from 1983-89, State Senator from 1971-81.
THE ISSUES
Mr.
Lieberman's TV advertising depicts him as an advocate for creating jobs, fighting crime and making Congress more accountable.
Dr.
Labriola, relying largely on handshaking and yard signs, assails Mr.
Lieberman for backing President Clinton's budget plan last year, calling it the largest tax increase in history.
Dr.
Labriola says Mr.
Lieberman "fakes right and votes left." ANALYSIS
Mr.
Lieberman has had a commanding lead in the polls from the beginning and a huge advantage in fund raising, allowing him to air television commercials that focus on his family and his achievements and do not mention his opponent.
Dr.
Labriola has had little money for television ads.
Some Democratic Party analysts have predicted the most lopsided victory in state history.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  SECOND DISTRICT CANDIDATES
SAM GEJDENSON, 45, Democrat, dean of the Connecticut delegation to the House of Representatives, seeking his eighth term.
EDWARD W. MUNSTER, 53, Republican, a retired statistician at Pfizer.
Served one two-year term in the State Senate before challenging Mr.
Gejdenson in 1992, a race he narrowly lost.
THE DISTRICT
The Second Congressional District is the state's largest, geographically, covering most of eastern Connecticut.
It has been in flux economically as military jobs have declined and as gambling and tourism jobs have increased with the rise of the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard.
THE ISSUES
Mr.
Munster campaigned last time on the argument that Mr.
Gejdenson had lost his local bearings after more than a decade in Congress.
This time, the debate has centered more on effectiveness.
Mr.
Munster's commercials attack Mr.
Gejdenson's attendance record for major votes.
Mr.
Gejdenson's commercials say Mr.
Munster failed to do much of note as a State Senator.
ANALYSIS
Mr.
Gejdenson did not appear to take Mr.
Munster seriously in 1992, but he is fighting hard this time, trading blow for blow in a negative campaign that seems to have shifted the advantage to Mr.
Gejdenson.
He has portrayed his Washington savvy as reaping huge benefits for the district in business for military contractors.
FIFTH DISTRICT CANDIDATES
GARY A. FRANKS, 41, Republican, seeking his third term, the first black Republican elected to the House of Representatives in 60 years.
Former labor-relations executive.
JAMES H. MALONEY, 46, Democrat, State Senator from Danbury since 1986. THE DISTRICT
The district is economically diverse, encompassing wealthy enclaves like Wilton and Ridgefield and blue-collar cities like Waterbury and Meriden.
Once a Democratic stronghold, it was seized by the Republicans in the 1984 Reagan landslide.
THE ISSUES
Mr.
Maloney, with far less name recognition or money than his opponent, has tried to portray Mr.
Franks as a Congressman more interested in gaining a national reputation than serving constituents.
Mr.
Franks has contended that Mr.
Maloney has no real agenda to pursue if elected.
ANALYSIS
Mr.
Franks was considered vulnerable in 1992, when Bill Clinton carried Connecticut in the Presidential election, but he won with a 43 percent plurality when two Democrats -- one running as an independent -- split the Democratic vote.
This year, he could benefit from having John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate for governor, on the ticket.
Mr.
Rowland represented the district from 1985 to 1991, and remains popular there.

Looking Back on 30,000 Games
WELCOME to my zoo," said Matthew (Pop) Shortell, ushering a guest into a room packed with more than a half a century's worth of memories. Hundreds of pictures and dozens of awards were filed away in boxes, plastered to the walls and stacked mountain-high on wooden book shelves.
Behind the oversized, elevated chair on which Mr.
Shortell has spent countless hours seated -- typing game reports and compiling endless statistics of every sport played in community of Ansonia for the past 57 years -- hang autographed pictures of former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.


POSTINGS: The Octagon Tower; A Plan to Stabilize a Roosevelt Island Landmark
One of New York's most haunting ruins, the 155-year-old Octagon tower on Roosevelt Island, has long posed a vexing question to those who would restore it: To which incarnation should the landmark be returned?
To the design by Alexander Jackson Davis from the early 1830's, which was almost surely not followed exactly?
To its appearance when completed in 1839 as the New York City Lunatic Asylum?
To the time in 1878 when the low roof was replaced by a Victorian dome, designed by Joseph M. Dunn?
The Octagon is an eight-sided tower with a spectacular flying staircase that spirals around a 62-foot-high rotunda.
It once served as the hub between the south and west wings of a much larger building.
The wings were demolished in 1970.
The dome was lost in a 1982 fire that also ravaged the interior.

Oct.2-Nov.5: Hate and Hurt; Nationwide Vigil Ends As Boys' Bodies Found And the Mother Is Charged
The ministers called for forgiveness and togetherness in the aftermath of the arrest last week of Susan Smith, the mother who claimed her 3-year-old and 14-month-old sons were taken by a carjacker, only to be charged in their murders when divers found the two boys at the bottom of a lake.
But in Union, S.C., where the hoax once rallied a whole community, the talk on the street was more about hate and hurt than healing.
People who see about one killing a year in their county of 30,000, who believe serious crime is a missing hubcap on the Oldsmobile, hissed, jeered and shouted hateful things -- "I hope you die, you baby killer," said one woman -- as Mrs.
Smith was driven away from the Union County Courthouse after being charged with murder.


Educating Just Plain Blokes
When the British Government decided to move higher education from a system that caters to the elite to a system that educates the masses, it didn't reckon so many of the masses would be interested.
Six years ago, when only one out of six high school graduates entered universities, the Government announced that times were changing.
It vowed to give more people the opportunity to get a university education and it set a target: One out of every three high school graduates would go on to higher education by the end of the century.
It didn't take nearly that long.
As the Government, which subsidizes higher education in Britain, encouraged expansion by increasing the funds it provides to universities by almost a third, the number of students rose from 261,900 in 1988 to 436,200 in 1993.


Few Takers for Tour of New S.R.O.
Aiming to quiet protests over plans to move homeless people into Euclid Hall, the managers of the building at Broadway and 86th Street have begun conducting weekly public tours to generate a more positive image to neighbors.
For the last month, on Thursdays at 10 A.M. and 6 P.M., visitors have seen offices, a model suite and recreation areas in the vacant, renovated north side of the building, which has been the focus of protests.


SUNDAY: November 6, 1994; Rink Pollution
The real threat to Nancy Kerrigan may not have been Tonya Harding.
Tests conducted earlier this year in several Massachusetts ice arenas by WCVB, a Boston television station, showed sky-high carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide readings.
The highest numbers were recorded at Stoneham Arena, Kerrigan's home rink.
The primary culprit?
Motorized ice resurfacing machines (Zamboni is the best known), which often lack pollution controls.
Rinks don't usually recirculate their air, so the gases accumulate.
And figure skaters, hockey players and spectators at rinks from Sun Valley, Idaho, to Tampa Bay, Fla., have been hospitalized for exposure to these fumes, which can kill at high levels. (Vitas Gerulaitis, the tennis player, recently died of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning at a friend's house.)


Ideas &amp; Trends; The Wishful Politics Of Campaign '94
WHATEVER the exact outcome of Tuesday's midterm elections, the mandate for members of the next Congress is clear, based on the oratory and advertising of Campaign '94: They must push hard for a balanced budget, cut taxes and protect -- utterly and absolutely -- the sanctity of Social Security and Medicare.
They must get tough with welfare recipients, make crime a top priority, hold the line on social spending and keep the Government out of the health care system while repairing its flaws.


In a Four-Way Race in Connecticut, the Stratagems Seem Endless
Four candidates for governor of Connecticut each stand to draw more than 10 percent of the popular vote on Tuesday, according to polls released this week.
That may sound like a simple statistic, but political experts say that its implications, and the weird dynamic it has imposed on candidates and voters, is anything but simple.
Consider, to name just one voting group that has come feverishly into play in the campaign's final days, women voters.
Independent polls have shown that a significant percentage of Republican women who had supported John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate and front-runner, have grown disenchanted in recent weeks.
Mr.
Rowland's efforts to keep secret a police report about a domestic disturbance at his ex-wife's home in Middlebury earlier this year is considered the cause.


Emily H. Mitty, Jonathan Cappo
Emily Honore Mitty, the daughter of Drs.
Harold and Ethel Mitty of New York, was married last evening to Jonathan Wheeler Cappo, a son of Eugene and Carolyn Cappo of Flushing, Mich., at the Rainbow Room in New York.
The Rev.

Mrs.
Cappo, 29, is a product manager at the American Home Products Corporation, the pharmaceuticals and consumer-products company, in Madison, N.J.
She graduated from the University of Michigan, as did her husband, and received an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago.

THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: Pennsylvania  The Last Weekend: Senate Races Where the Battle Has Been Intense; A War of Words On Social Security
The Senate candidates in Pennsylvania have become locked in a pitched battle over Social Security, a fight that defines their vast ideological differences.
Both candidates -- Senator Harris Wofford, a liberal Democrat, and Representative Rick Santorum, a conservative Republican -- began this unusually warm autumn day courting votes in Philadelphia.
Mr.
Santorum shook hands at the Italian Market in South Philadelphia, a must-stop on any political tour, before campaigning in Harrisburg with the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, and going on to West Hazleton, where he received the endorsement of the City Council President, a Democrat.
Mr.
Wofford, meanwhile, joined a motorcade with Philadelphia labor leaders and met with residents of suburban Narberth to talk about his opposition to assault weapons.


Remembering the Titanic
More than 150 artifacts salvaged from the wreck of the Titanic are on view through April 2 at the National Maritime Museum in London.
The objects -- including letters, a steward's jacket and passengers' personal effects -- were recovered from the ocean floor around the wreck, which lies two and a half miles beneath the North Atlantic, off Newfoundland.
The intense cold, absence of light and low oxygen levels in the ocean bed have slowed the deterioration of the artifacts, which also include a cigarette case with cigarettes and a copy of The Southampton Echo dated April 9, 1912.


K. B. Maynard, D. R. Hamilton Jr.
Katherine Boyce Maynard, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
David L. Maynard of High Point, N.C., was married there yesterday to Donald Ross Hamilton Jr., a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Hamilton of New York.
The Rev.
Dr.
Julian McClees Aldridge Jr. performed the ceremony at the Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church.
Mrs.
Hamilton, 27, and her husband, 25, graduated from Duke University.
She was until recently an assistant in Raleigh, N.C., to Governor James Hunt.


Business Diary: October 30 - November 4
THE ECONOMY The Economy's Up, and Politicians Are in Trouble.
What Gives?
All those cliches are surely true: People vote their pocketbooks.
It's the economy, stupid.
And so on.
The economy's clearly on a roll -- just last week, in fact, came word that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.8 percent, a four-year low.
You can't ask for more than that.
But if those fancy polls are right, voters are about to turn that conventional wisdom on its head and thrash the Democrats.
What's up?
Hard as it may be for the statisticians to swallow, the public just may not believe, or care about, the official data -- they see headlines about layoffs, they see their incomes stagnating, they see a tightfisted workplace.
As one economist put it, "Even in a nasty recession, 90 percent of the work force has jobs." So forget the G.D.P., the C.P.I., all the high-gloss numbers.
If voters feel shaky, they'll throw the bums out on Tuesday.


C. M. Axtmann, James K. Mueller
Connelle Marguerite Axtmann, a daughter of Dr.
Robert and Annabell Axtmann of Princeton, N.J., was married yesterday to James Keightly Mueller, the son of Warren and Martha-Jane Mueller of Dansville, Mich.
The Rev.
James Covington, a Unitarian Universalist minister, performed the ceremony at the Lotos Club in New York.
The bride is a commercial writer and illustrator in New York.
She graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design.
Her father is a professor emeritus of chemical engineering at Princeton University.
Her mother is an artist.
The bride's first marriage was annulled.

Williams Enters Plea
Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman ERIK WILLIAMS has agreed to plead no contest to a misdemeanor drunken driving charge, ending a grand jury investigation into an Oct. 24 accident.
In exchange for the plea, Williams's attorney said Friday, Dallas County prosecutors also agreed to recommend probation for Williams, who is out for the season because of torn knee ligaments suffered in the accident. (AP)


As Pope Visits Sicily, Mafia Sends Gruesome Warning to Priest
CATANIA, Sicily, Nov. 5
Hours after Pope John Paul II arrived here on a visit and urged Sicilians to stand firm against the Mafia, mobsters made clear what they thought of that sentiment in a gruesome but familiar way today, sending a lamb with its throat slit to the home of a Sicilian priest.
"This is how you will finish up," said a note attached to the dead animal.
The lamb was found hanging on the door of the Rev.
Gino Sacchetti, a prison chaplain and head of a drug rehabilitation center near Palermo on the northern coast of Sicily.
The note was viewed as a warning to the anti-Mafia priest, not to the Pope, police and church officials said.


West Coast Fisheries Are Also in Trouble
To the Editor:
Re "In New England Fish Country, the End of Fishing" (Gloucester Journal, Oct. 31): Americans are becoming aware of the sorry state of the nation's fisheries.
Not only is Georges Bank, off Cape Cod, being closed to commercial fishing, but restrictions on salmon fishing have been imposed on much of the West Coast, where several salmon species are in danger of extinction.


Lynn A. Lieff, Leslie P. Goldman
Lynn Alyce Lieff, a managed care specialist, is to be married today to Dr.
Leslie Philip Goldman, a gastroenterologist in Torrington, Conn.
Rabbi Simeon Glaser is to officiate at Congregation Beth Israel in West Hartford, Conn.
The bride works at Tokos Clinical Services, a maternity-care company in Farmington, Conn.
She graduated from Boston University.
She is a daughter of Fay and Jack Siegel of Boynton Beach, Fla.


A Book Idea, Post Gutenberg
WITH "Alfred the Ant," the children's storytelling book he has written, illustrated and privately published, Jehan Clements wants to parlay his gift of invention in a more literal sense: the well-traveled purveyor of traditional tales and original yarns has nearly patented his book's unusual format and design.
Encouraging greater interaction between a storyteller and his or her audience, the 48-page, spiral-bound teacher's edition of "Alfred the Ant" is now available at many bookstores and retailers of educational materials.


Runner Is Thrilled to See Potholes as Well as His Competitors
In marathons in Russia, Mischa Gorbunov had been known to run into people.
Run head-on into them.
"Hey!" an angry runner would say, turning around after being bumped or having his heels stepped on.
"Are you blind? Didn't you see me here?"


Profile; He's Trying to Lift Westinghouse by Its Scruff
MIKE JORDAN swept into a hazardous-waste incinerator plant in Utah last year for a first-hand look at what had been billed as a promising environmental business.
To his amazement, the incinerator was shut down.
Workers there told him that they had only enough material to run the plant one day each week.
Because of the high cost of burning, generators of hazardous waste had found ways to greatly reduce their output.


Corrections
An article last Sunday about Ellen Burstein, a former consumer reporter stricken with multiple sclerosis, misstated the source of financing for her nursing aides.

Belford Commuter Ferry Proposal Becomes an Election Issue
A MONMOUTH COUNTY proposal for a New York-bound commuter ferry service out of this tiny Middletown Township fishing community, struggling to preserve its historic and residential identities, is now dead.
But the outcome of the Sixth District Congressional race could determine if the proposal will ever be resurrected.
And in an unusual election spinoff, a key county freeholder race and another for a seat on the Middletown governing body are focusing on the ferry development plan as well, the first time within memory that a single issue has figured so prominently in three hard-fought campaigns in the county.


Closest Living On the Planet: Ocean Depths
Jungles and rain forests, move over.
It turns out that the densest aggregations of animal life on this blue planet are found not on land but under the sea, a scientist reported last week.
Writing in the journal Nature, the scientist, Eric W. Vetter, says a submarine canyon off the California coast at San Diego swarms with crustaceans in densities far greater than any other known animal group on earth.


THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: CUOMO In a Fury of Campaigning, Candidates Pursue Last-Minute Votes; Led by Giuliani, Cuomo Surrogates Press Attacks on Pataki
Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo continued yesterday to let Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other high-profile surrogates level the most ferocious attacks on his Republican opponent, State Senator George E. Pataki, as the Governor stuck determinedly to a more positive script while campaigning in Brooklyn and the Bronx.
In an event organized by the Cuomo campaign, Mr.
Giuliani appeared on the City Hall steps with one of his leading political antagonists, Public Advocate Mark Green, to argue that a Pataki administration would not set high ethical standards because of Mr.
Pataki's close relationship with United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.


Gooden Accepts Price Of Breaking the Rules
DWIGHT GOODEN says he accepts the blame for his problems.
Gooden, who was suspended for the 1995 season on Friday because of violations of the league's drug abuse policy, told The St.
Petersburg Times in an interview published yesterday: "Those are the rules. And you break the rules, that's the price you pay."
It is possible that Gooden, now a free agent, will never pitch for the Mets again -- or anyone else -- but he said: "To me, baseball is at this point in time nowhere in my mind right now. Who knows? Maybe this is what I need to get everything totally back on track."


Clinton Strategists See Gloom for Next 2 Years
The White House started looking beyond Election Day weeks ago, and President Clinton's aides, deeply troubled by what they foresee, have been debating ever since what their strategy for 1995 should be.
"Tuesday will be bad," one of Mr.
Clinton's top advisers said.
"We will lose a lot of ground. Wednesday will be almost pleasant. People will wake up to the fact that we have done better than we might have and better than a lot of people predicted. At least we hope so. But Thursday will be terrible because everyone will begin to realize what a really difficult two years lie ahead."

Perking Up Pasta With Wild Mushrooms
REMEMBER when the only mushrooms were cultivated whitecaps?
Now markets offer wild mushrooms: portobello, shiitake and oyster mushrooms, orange chanterelles and porcini.
Porcini are boletus mushrooms, also known as cepes, Polish mushrooms or Steinpilz.
They are good dried, too, but they need to be soaked in hot water or chicken broth for about half an hour.


Streetscapes/Mills House No. 1 on Bleecker Street; A Clean, Airy 1897 Home for 1,560 Working Men
MILLS HOUSE NO. 1, opened in 1897 on Bleecker Street between Sullivan and Thompson Streets, set a standard for clean and sanitary accommodation for the poor and working classes that may never be matched, sheltering thousands who might otherwise have become tramps.
Converted to apartments in the 70's, the light, airy building has been at the center of a long legal dispute that has left most of the ground-floor stores empty.

Eternity Faithful To Old School Days
FOR those alumni who fear that class rings, license plates, T-shirts and bumper stickers can't quite express their eternal affection for their alma mater, a Michigan company is offering souvenirs to die for: fiberglass coffins in school colors -- say, Hoosier red or Aggie maroon.
James Kieszkowski, the owner of Oak Grove International in Manistee, Mich., says his company will customize coffins in school colors and with sports symbols.
"We've sold a number of caskets in Indiana that are red with a white interior," Mr.
Kieszkowski said.
Maroon coffins sell with Aggie fans from Texas A &amp; M, he said.
A coffin's inside lid can also be customized with a football going between the goalposts or a basketball being slam-dunked through the hoop.
To keep costs down, the company does not use logos, school lettering or other trademarked items, Mr.
Kieszkowski said.


Clancy vs. Buckley
To the Editor:
Right on, Christopher Buckley!
After attempting, unsuccessfully, to read Tom Clancy's "Debt of Honor," I concluded he must have been paid by the word.
The book is not only racist but unforgivably boring.
Shame on his editors for not having the courage to do their jobs -- and shame on Mr.
Clancy for milking the cash cow.

Correction
A picture caption about the blues singer Big Joe Turner on Oct. 16 misstated the date of the scene.

THE ANGER: EVER DEEPER
We have become a "hot button" electorate, demanding solutions by slogan that appear easy to implement.
We punish political figures who do not promise such solutions by voting against them.
Then we are frustrated when their opponents, who may have run for office on the easy-answer ticket, cannot deliver the painless fix they promise.


Bruce D. Shalett and Lisa M. Roseff
Lisa Meredith Roseff, a daughter of Barbara and Dr.
Lionel Roseff of East Hills, L.I., was married last evening to Bruce Daniel Shalett, the son of Doris and Philip Shalett of Ridgewood, N.J.

Mrs.
Shalett, 28, is an associate in Japanese equities sales in New York at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the London investment bank.
She graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and she and the bridegroom also received their M.B.A. degrees there.
Her father is an obstetrician and gynecologist in New York.
Her mother is a partner at Barnett Interiors, a design firm in Greenvale, L.I.


Rwanda Faces New War Unless International Force Is Sent, U.N. Aides Say
United Nations officials say that if this tiny country is to be spared another war, an international force must be quickly sent to the refugee camps in Zaire, where soldiers and militiamen of the former Rwandan Government are increasing their preparedness for battle.
Forces of the former Government are already making regular incursions into Rwanda and in some instances have ambushed the new Government's soldiers, the commander of the United Nations troops here, Maj.
Gen.
Guy Tousignant, said in an interview today.

2 Arrested as Police Find a 'Cocaine Lab'
Two police officers responding to a report of a burglary at a West Harlem apartment building yesterday discovered instead what officials described as a cocaine lab and thousands of dollars in cash.
The officers, Cathy Meehan and Anthony Gonzalez, were sent to the apartment about 3:30 A.M. after a 911 call reporting a burglary in progress in an apartment at 61 Hamilton Terrace, said Detective Andrew McInnis, a Police Department spokesman.


Miami Slams Syracuse And Is First in the East
The thrill may be gone in Syracuse, but the swagger is definitely back at Miami.
Once regarded as the Big, Bad Wolf of college football, Miami, dispelling any notion that its program had been tamed, rolled over Syracuse this afternoon, 27-6.
The Hurricanes did it with a crushing defense that shut down the vaunted Syracuse option offense and with a heavyweight offense that bulldozed Syracuse at will in the second half.


'In Defense of Elitism'
To the Editor:
Roger Kimball owns up manfully that while "it is painful to admit it . . . Henry is right" when he states that "you could eliminate every woman writer, painter and composer from the cave man era to the present moment and not significantly deform the course of Western culture."


The Nation; For the Environment, Compassion Fatigue
THE 1990's could hardly have begun better for the national environmental movement.
A new Clean Air Act to clear the skies of toxic chemicals became law.
Polls indicated that Americans overwhelmingly supported tough environmental rules and said they would pay more for them.
Democrats elected a new team to the White House, in part because the Vice President was sympathetic to ecological concerns and wrote a best-selling book on the subject.
But midway through, the decade is shaping up as a period of turmoil for the environmental movement.
Membership and budgets have dropped for most of the national groups.
A well-organized counter-movement of landowners, city officials and industrial executives steamed into Washington and halted Congressional work this year on strengthening environmental laws.
They argued that environmentalists were exaggerating and using inconclusive data to frighten people and influence lawmakers.


The World; Here Comes the Clown. No Joke.
WHEN Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the energetic Russian extremist who likes to spit and throw rocks at protesters, struts his stuff across the United States this week there will be a huge temptation to laugh.
Don't.
He's sure to be offensive and clownish and captivatingly crude.
But it's time Americans realized he's not that funny.
The United States is, after all, a country he has denounced in nearly every speech he has ever delivered.


Phone Vandals Cut Off Community
Carlos Diaz, 28, a bus driver whose route runs up First Avenue in East Harlem, recalled his frustration two months ago when he was unable to reach his wife.
"I literally stopped every two blocks," he said.
"They were all out of service."
The experience taught him an important lesson: he bought a cellular phone.


From Ward of Court To Quest for Bench
GEORGE DARLOW was not your run-of-the-mill town drunk, nor is he a typical candidate as Tuesday's election approaches.
He is seeking the position as judge of the Probate Court for the district of Washington, which also includes the Litchfield County communities of Washington Depot, New Preston and Marble Dale.
Mr.
Darlow brings to the political race an unusual personal perspective.
It is that of having been an alcoholic with 15 years of his life virtually controlled by the court he now seeks to join.


Technology; 900,000 Striped Bass, and Not a Fishing Pole in Sight
TO Josh Goldman, it's all very simple.
On a display board, he draws one line, slanting upward -- that's the world demand for fish.
Below that, a second line, slanting down -- the wild supply, steadily being depleted.
The widening gap represents the fish the world will need from other sources.
And for reasons he is eager to enumerate, he insists that traditional fish farming will be unable to fill that gap.
But Mr.
Goldman says he has the solution, and with supreme confidence and the blinders of the true believer, he is out to prove it.


Assertive and Inspired by an Old Favorite
A METAL sculpture stands in front of the newly opened Coach Grill in Oyster Bay.
Inspection reveals a beautifully painted antique coach complete with passengers.
On the door of the carriage are the words "Viennese Coach." The artifact was salvaged from the Viennese Coach restaurant in Syosset, a North Shore landmark for 38 years until it burned in 1989.
Lennart Lundstrum, whose family owned the Viennese Coach, is keeping the tradition alive with the Coach Grill.
But diners expecting a Viennese Coach redux are in for surprises.
When the man at the next table asked for salmon with dill sauce, a standby at the old restaurant, he was told, "The Coach Grill is an American restaurant." Instead of the European classic it offers a "wood-roasted salmon filet dusted with dry mustard and fine herbs, surrounded by pumpkin vinaigrette, served on a bed of baby greens garnished with tomato concasse and toasted pumpkin seeds."

Struggle Over Gay Rights Moves to Statewide Level
Gay politicians and political issues have moved from the local to the statewide level this year, with referendums in Oregon and Idaho and candidates in California and New York attesting to the growing presence of homosexuals on the campaign landscape.
Oregon and Idaho are at center stage in the nation's struggle over whether homosexuals are entitled to civil-rights protection as a bona fide, vulnerable minority or have no such claim on the basis of behavior that many regard as wrong.


The Fertile Crescent Blooms Anew
When Abdul Latif Suleiman came here in the 1970's there were no farms or orchards along this narrow stretch of the Barada River, where it tumbles through the arid foothills above Damascus.
"You could not find a single vegetable plant, a single tree," said Mr.
Suleiman, 63, smiling proudly as he stood in the ragged shade of the apple orchard he planted 17 years ago.
Behind him, the steady pocketa-pocketa of a small engine was the only sound breaking the afternoon stillness as it pumped water from the brown river and spilled it among the muddy tangle of melon vines and eggplants.


Senator Voiced Concern Over Air Inspectors
Despite repeated denials by Senator Tom Daschle, new evidence shows that his office intervened directly with Federal aviation inspectors who had warned that an air charter company owned by a friend of his was unsafe.
Other new evidence shows that Senator Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, also personally pressed the Federal aviation inspectors' Washington supervisors with complaints that inspections of the company were unduly harsh.
In an article last month, The New York Times reported that Mr.
Daschle had undertaken a two-year effort to strip the United States Forest Service of authority to inspect air charter companies after aviation inspectors repeatedly warned that B&amp;L Aviation of Rapid City, S.D., was shoddily run and should be barred from doing Government business.


The Election: A Voters' Guide To the Candidates
UNITED STATES SENATE  CANDIDATES
FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 70, Democrat.
Elected to the United States Senate in 1982; no experience in elective politics before that.
A millionaire businessman who co-founded one of the most successful computing services in the world, Automatic Data Processing.
Born in Paterson, now lives in Cliffside Park.
Has raised $7.4 million for this race.
GARABED (CHUCK) HAYTAIAN, 56, Republican.
An electrical engineer first elected to the State Assembly in 1981; Speaker of the Assembly since 1992, which makes him the third most powerful elected official in New Jersey.
Born in the Bronx, now lives in Independence, in rural Warren County.
Has raised $4.4 million.
--------------------
ANDREA LIPPI, independent
RICHARD J. PEZZULLO, Conservative Party
GEORGE PATRICK PREDHAM, independent
ARLENE GOLD, Natural Law Party
JOANNE KUNIANSKY, Socialist Workers Party
BEN GRINDLINGER, Libertarian Party
MICHAEL P. KELLY, independent THE ISSUES
Politically, the candidates are polar opposites -- Mr.
Lautenberg's politics are liberal to moderate and Mr.
Haytaian is a strict conservative.
The centerpiece of Mr.
Haytaian's campaign is a flat Federal income tax, and one of his campaign props is a slick brochure outlining 94 ways to cut waste and spending in Washington.
Mr.
Lautenberg says the tax plan is a fraud that would add $1 trillion to the national deficit over five years; he calls other Haytaian ideas unworkable or unoriginal.
Although both candidates have been in office a long time, each is trying to cast himself as the outsider and his rival as the career politician.
At times, however, Mr.
Lautenberg portrays himself as an inside outsider, saying that he would be able to do more for New Jersey as a third-term Senator than Mr.
Haytaian would as a novice in Washington.
ANALYSIS
Though polls throughout the campaign have shown Mr.
Lautenberg with a comfortable lead, the New Jersey electorate is notorious for last-minute volatility and there is still a large bloc of undecided voters.
Mr.
Lautenberg needs a good turnout from the traditionally Democratic urban areas.
A year ago, Gov.
Jim Florio, a Democrat, lost to Christine Todd Whitman by about 25,000 votes out of 2.5 million votes cast, largely because he did poorly and she did surprisingly well on that kind of turf.
For Mr.
Haytaian to win, he must rally his bedrock of conservative voters and the rest of the Republican faithful, but as importantly, he must match Mrs.
Whitman's performance in urban areas, particularly among black voters.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  SECOND DISTRICT CANDIDATES
FRANK A. LOBIONDO, 48.
Republican from Vineland, a State Assemblyman who works as the operations manager for his family's trucking business.
A former member of the Cumberland County Board of Freeholders, first elected to the State Assembly in 1987.
Has earned a reputation as its most conservative member.
Sponsored law making "stalking" a crime.
Lost 1992 race for Congress against the Democratic incumbent, William J. Hughes.
LOUIS N. MAGAZZU, 37, Democrat from Vineland.
A lawyer, currently the solicitor for the city of Vineland; has never held elected office.
THE DISTRICT
Before 1974, the Second could be counted on to vote Republican.
But Mr.
Hughes rode to victory that year on the Watergate wave that swept dozens of Democrats into office.
In spite of his party label, his conservative politics and his support of environmental protection, anti-crime legislation and senior-citizen issues helped him hold on to that office for 20 years before he decided earlier this year to retire.
It is expected that with the popular Mr.
Hughes now off the political scene, the district will return a Republican to office.
THE ISSUES
Mr.
LoBiondo has campaigned unwaveringly on conservative beliefs: lower taxes, spending cuts and reduction of the Federal Government.
Mr.
Magazzu has stressed fighting crime as the main theme of his campaign, including championing gun control laws.
ANALYSIS
In land mass, southern New Jersey's sprawling Second District -- which encompasses all of Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem counties and parts of Gloucester and Burlington counties, is the largest in the state.
In politics, it is bedrock Republican and conservative.
In 1992, registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats 85,000 to 70,000 with about 150,000 unaffiliated voters.
If Mr.
LoBiondo loses, it will rank as a major Election Day upset.
The Republican candidate has raised more money than his opponent by a 3-to-1 margin and polls show him with at least a 30-point lead.
The race has significance beyond even the impressive boundaries of the Second.
Under the redistricting that reduced the New Jersey Congressional delegation to 13, Mr.
Hughes's lock on the Second District gave Democrats a 7-to-6 majority.
The majority will assuredly shift to the Republicans on Nov. 8.
In practice, it will give the Republicans little more than political bragging rights, but it will be another blow to the political psyche of New Jersey's Democrats, who in the last four years have also lost control of both chambers of the Legislature and the Governor's mansion.
EIGHTH DISTRICT CANDIDATES
HERB KLEIN, 64, a Democrat and a lawyer from Clifton.
Served in the State Assembly for four years in the 1970's.
Won Congressional seat two years ago in an expensive and bitter race.
A prominent Democratic fund-raiser between his two stints in elected office, Mr.
Klein spent more than $500,000 of his own money and $1.2 million overall in his victory two years ago.
BILL MARTINI, 47, a Republican and a lawyer from Clifton.
Served on Clifton City Council and is a Passaic County Freeholder; also a former Assistant United States Attorney for New Jersey.
THE DISTRICT
The Eighth was redesigned two years ago after New Jersey lost one of its 14 Congressional seats as a result of the 1990 Census.
When Representative Robert A. Roe, a 12-term Democrat, saw the new district lines, he decided to retire.
The district, once a haven for Democrats, is now highly competitive.
It includes the blue-collar urban centers of Paterson and Passaic, as well as suburban towns like Glen Ridge, Cedar Grove and Verona.
THE ISSUES
Both candidates say fear of crime is the chief concern of voters, with the economy, taxes and government spending also high on the list.
Mr.
Klein points to the recently enacted Federal crime bill as the first initiative coming out of Washington in years that offers real hope of increasing public safety.
Mr.
Martini calls the bill "pork laden," with programs that have little to do with crime-fighting.
He has said that only the certainty of prison sentences will reduce violent crime.
Mr.
Klein said he voted against the Clinton budget because it did not have enough spending cuts, and has consistently opposed tax increases that affect the middle class.
Mr.
Martini charges that his opponent later voted for all the spending proposals in the budget he opposed and that he repeatedly passed up opportunities to vote for further deficit reductions.
ANALYSIS
Leaders in both parties agree that this is the closest Congressional race in the state this year.
Both sides have spent heavily on campaign advertising and have been supported by visits from party luminaries from outside the state.

The Queen Mary
To the Editor: When the Queen Mary was a troop carrier during World War II she had an experience that could have changed J. M. Fenster's story about her ("An Ocean Liner Berthed and Burnished," Oct. 2) or indeed made it unwritable.
On one of her crossings in 1944, the Mary, as she was affectionately known, was ferrying a full complement of United States Army Air Forces personnel, mostly pilots, to their duties in England.
As she neared the end of her trip, sailing north through the Bay of Biscay in sparkling weather, lookouts aboard spotted a Nazi reconnaissance plane that in turn had seen and marked the ship as the incredibly valuable target she would be.
In those days, the Mary sailed by herself; she was too fast to travel in convoy.
There were no warships to protect her and not enough time for fighter pilots from Britain to reach her before enemy bombers struck; they would be too much for the Mary's own antiaircraft to handle.


Habitats/Upheaval on East 70th Street; Letting Light Into a Dark 1860's Brick Town House
RICK KAMINER stood shoulder to shoulder with the workmen, he -- the owner -- in a natty pinstripe suit and they -- the plumbers, the carpenter, the electrician -- in khakis and sweatshirts.
"Try adding them up again," he joked with one workman who had just handed him estimates for some additional work.


Sound Bytes; Age 16, and Success Is Sweet
MICHAEL SIMMONS went into business for himself when he was 12 years old, operating a computer bulletin-board out of his grandmother's home in Palm Springs, Calif.
At the time, he was too young to open a checking account and was refused entry at computer trade shows.
Today, at 16, Mr.
Simmons is president of Dataport Computer Services, which has five workers and an office in Palm Springs.


Alicia G. Clifton, Alan J. Chabot
Alicia Gorham Clifton, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Peter F. Clifton of Water Mill, L.I., was married yesterday to Alan James Chabot, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
J.
Richard Chabot of Longmeadow, Mass.
The Rev.
Robert Kennedy performed the ceremony at the Queen of the Most Holy Rosary Church in Bridgehampton, L.I.
Mrs.
Chabot, 30, was until recently an associate at Millsport, a sports marketing company in Stamford, Conn.
She graduated from Harvard University.
Her father and her mother, Alice Clifton, own Clifton Associates, a teacher placement agency for private schools, based in Water Mill.


Old Kremlin, New Kremlin
Russia lost one weak Finance Minister recently but gained another, causing a Deputy Prime Minister to resign in protest.
But today the Government's strongest market-minded reformer, Anatoly B. Chubais, was elevated to First Deputy Prime Minister, while the Prime Minister promised to continue a tough fight against inflation.
Does all this Kremlin maneuvering matter?
It does, of course, especially for the economy, and for the level of confidence of those who are thinking about lending or investing in Russia.


Only the Smart Survive Against the Bills' Smith
A generation ago, the Jets were preparing for a game with the Kansas City Chiefs and their future Hall of Fame defensive tackle, Buck Buchanan.
"Playing every play against Buck Buchanan is awful," said Sam DeLuca, the Jets' offensive guard.
"After an ordinary game, on Wednesday my aches start going away. After you play against Buck, on Thursday the aches are getting worse."


Penn Clinches Tie For Title Against Tigers
The Ivy League race came to an abrupt end today with Penn's 33-19 victory over Princeton coupled with Cornell's loss to Yale at New Haven.
The Quakers, who won their 19th game in a row and seventh this season, gained at least a tie for the title with two games left, against Harvard and Cornell.


Uneasy Seoul Reconsiders Its Relations With North Korea
Lee Jong Sik escaped from North Korea 45 years ago with her two young sons, leaving her husband and two brothers behind.
Now, a new agreement aimed at curbing North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program promises to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula, offering hope for divided families.
But Mrs.
Lee is not counting on it.
"You just can't trust those people," said Mrs.
Lee, 69 years old, referring to the North Korean Government.
As for the chance of being reunited with her family, she said, "It will be almost impossible to meet them before I die."


The Little Record Labels That Could (and They Did)
THE HISTORY OF THE American recording industry can be seen as a series of land-grabs, gold rushes during which pockets of sound are discovered and feverishly mined until a richer lode is found.
One of the most significant of these outbreaks was the appearance in the late 1940's and 1950's -- overnight, like so many mushrooms -- of countless small independent record companies based in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and other urban centers.
Fed and watered by the huge numbers of blacks who had swarmed to the cities for defense jobs during World War II, the indies, as they were called, pumped out dance music, hot blues and boogie-woogie records that the major labels usually just didn't bother with.
These small companies were often started by music-industry amateurs -- small businessmen, nightclub owners and hustlers, some of whom actually had a genuine ear for music, all of whom had an eye for the main chance.
Spurred by an amalgam of opportunism, megalomania, true love for music and sheer greed, they managed to document some of the most vigorous popular music ever recorded in America.
In the process, they called the tune that the entire industry eventually danced to.


Lebow's Vision
To the Sports Editor:
Unmentioned in the articles about the late Fred Lebow was what he did for women's running.


Judge Ito, Spare That Camera
LET'S HOPE JUDICIAL temperament prevails and an understandably exasperated Judge Lance A. Ito draws back from his threat to ban the camera from the O. J. Simpson trial.
That threat, which will be the subject of a hearing tomorrow, grew out of his annoyance at an inaccurate news report by a Los Angeles television station, not the actual courtroom coverage.
On calm consideration it may occur to the judge that punishing courtroom television for the doings of a local station would be like jailing a felon's blameless cousin who happens to be within reach: guilt by relationship or accessibility.
As friends of courtroom coverage, including The New York Times editorial page, have pointed out, it is a form of television least susceptible to distortion.
But critics, including Max Frankel, once the head of that editorial page and later executive editor of the newspaper, and now a columnist for The New York Times Magazine, find such reasoning superficial.
They see the television camera not as an extension of the press but as a new sort of monster with the ability to cloud viewers' minds.
"Images on a screen," Mr.
Frankel wrote, "draw us into the action; they pound the emotions, bypass the mind."


Holiday Inn Thailand
A recent agreement means Holiday Inn is about to become a huge presence in Thailand.
The new venture, between the Narai Hotel Company of Thailand and Holiday Inn Worldwide, calls for the development of 47 Holiday Inns throughout the country over the next decade.
Holiday Inn already operates five hotels in Thailand, including Bangkok and the resort destination of Phuket, and has plans to develop hotels in India, Indonesia and Nepal over the next few years.

Voting Isn't Pretty, but Somebody Has to Do It; Those Good People
To the Editor:
Re "Here Come the Republocrats" (Op-Ed, Nov. 1): Ted Rall's explanation why he is abstaining from voting calls to mind a comment made by the humorist John Henry Faulk.
When asked to explain the consistent level of mediocrity in Washington, Faulk replied: "Congress is made up of bad politicians elected by good people who don't vote!" PHIL HALL  Bronx, Nov. 1, 1994


Computers That Tell Fairy Tales
IT is a statement that could send a purist into shock: "Students at the College of Wooster program computers to write Russian fairy tales."
But relax, the big bad wolf is not at the door.


HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL REPORT
Long Island  A CLOSE ONE: Tom Santoro rushed for two touchdowns and Ken Kraemer caught a 40-yard scoring strike from Jim Chase (14 of 25 for 261 yards) as MASSAPEQUA (7-0) won a sea-saw contest against its Conference I rival, FREEPORT (6-1), 32-28.
Bill Martin put Massapequa on the board first, booting field goals of 27 and 24 yards in the first two quarters.
Freeport answered in the second, with two Jimmy Jones touchdowns: a 1-yard dive and a 26-yard pass from Mike Leccesse, who later put Freeport in front in the third quarter, 20-6, with a 24-yard option run.
Santoro closed the gap to 20-12 when he scored from 8 yards out to cap the scoring in the third.
In the fourth quarter, Jones returned a kick 94 yards to help Freeport extend its lead to 28-12.
But Massapequa scored the game's last three touchdowns to complete the come-from-behind victory.
Santoro scored his second touchdown on a 9-yard run, Fred Garzon ran it in from 4 yards out and Kraemer caught a bomb from Chase.


Ghostly Spot, New Life . . .
When Pearl Fleming moved to Walton Avenue more than two decades ago, she would see the bustle around the Morrisania Hospital's emergency-room entrance and the students in the adjoining nursing school.
But for the last 18 years, her apartment window has looked out at enormous ghost buildings in an abandoned block surrounded by a 15-foot-high barbed-wire fence.
To some like Mrs.
Fleming, the deserted hospital, more than anything else, came to symbolize the misfortunes of Morrisania.
To others, the hospital represented abandonment of the South Bronx.


Tours, Teases and Teaching
IN THE best software for young children, and perhaps for adults too, there are no mistakes and no punishment.
Every wrong answer becomes an opportunity to learn something.
Here is some new software for children, much of it playful, some of it ponderously educational, much of it requiring CD-ROM and faster computers to deliver vast stockpiles of sound, photos, animation and movies.


The High Price of Free Excellence
THE poster-crammed bulleting boards, grubily clad undergraduates mingling in clumps and scent of old dust mixed with fresh paint bring to mind any of a hundred urban campuses.
But this isn't just any campus.
The students, a potpourri of races and ethnic groups, are among the most talented in America, and the curriculum is among the most demanding.
More striking, the only barrier to entry is the fierce competition for places in the freshman class.
For this is Cooper Union, a specialized college of art, architecture and engineering in Greenwich Village and the only private American college of its caliber that charges no tuition.

SUNDAY: November 6, 1994; N.Y.P.D. Blue
New York City police officers are turning in their powder blue shirts for navy blue ones.
With fashion so important in the city, why stop there?
Donna Karan and Norma Kamali could design a bodysuit for female officers.
Armani might redo the beat cop's outfit detective-style -- and deaccessorize the belt, please.
To further improve the quality of life, Mayor Giuliani might even empower police to go on fashion patrol, issuing tickets to badly dressed tourists who wear, say, Birkenstocks with socks.
Violators would be sentenced to buy new wardrobes, raising fashion consciousness in their hometown and raising profits in this one.


Even at 56, Jay Black Continues to Make Them Swoon
HIS fans include the John Gotti family and Richard M. Kessel.
Such a diversity of people flock to his performances that he holds the record for the most consecutive sellouts at the Westbury Music Fair, 17 as of last month's performance.
Because of the demand, an additional show has been added, for Nov. 25.
It being Thanksgiving weekend, he is afraid the sellout streak will end.
Fat chance.
On Long Island he has more loyal followers than a county executive.
Men rush to shake his hand.
Women rush to -- well . . .
"The cashier at OTB just gave me a pair of panties," he said the day after the October show.
"She was too embarrassed to toss them on stage last night." (But not too embarrassed to hand them over in broad daylight in an Offtrack Betting parlor.)


CRIME
A bullet can slow down your average hard-boiled detective, but a baby will drop him in his tracks.
John Marshall Tanner, the San Francisco investigator who specializes in missing persons and burning social issues in Stephen Greenleaf's thoughtful mysteries, gets a crash course in the biotechnology of baby making that really shakes him up in FALSE CONCEPTION (Otto Penzler, $22).
Uncommonly sensitive for someone in his trade, Tanner can be trusted to run a discreet background check on the woman his clients have chosen to carry their child, and you know that he'll bring an open mind to the politically murky ethics of artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization.
"Kids are always kids, in my experience, and I imagine it's true even in the embryonic stage," Tanner smoothly reasons.
But he doesn't count on falling for the surrogate mother -- who complicates everything by skipping town -- or on the strong feelings about paternity that are awakened by their affair.

To the Barricades of Egalite
Around the world, universities are wrestling with new challenges.
In countries where graduates find they have trained for careers in fields already crowded with professionals, many schools are shifting their emphasis to job training and workplace skills.
Some universities find themselves short of students; others have a surplus.
As institutions of higher learning struggle to find solutions, they are questioning long-held traditions and beliefs about their systems of higher education.
If French students were long thought to spend their time sitting around drinking coffee, smoking Gitanes and discussing philosophy, that image vanished in clouds of tear gas this spring when tens of thousands of them took to the streets to insist on their right to a well-paid job after they completed their studies.
The spark for the violent protests was a new law allowing employers to pay less than the legal minimum wage to those with technical diplomas.
Affected students were outraged.
They said they had been led to higher education by the promise of good jobs, but now were being told that their studies were worthless.
The Government quickly backed off, saying it had merely tried to fight unemployment, which affects one in four French youths between the ages of 18 and 25.
But the dispute helped focus on a more fundamental issue.
What is the purpose of higher education in France today?
Should youths be educated for the sake of being educated or should the emphasis be on preparing them for the workplace?
Traditionally, French universities had a somewhat elitist approach.
But since 1984 everyone who passes the baccalaureat examination at the end of high school has the right to a place at a university.
As a result, the number of students in higher education has jumped from 1.2 million in 1980 to 2 million this year.
Over this period, umemployment has continued to rise.
And since by law university students can study what they like, they are rarely guided toward degrees with better job prospects.
It is only when they complete their studies, then, that many discover they have not been prepared for the job market.
Officials in the Ministry of Higher Education conceded that they were under pressure from university rectors to limit the number of students and even to institute entry exams, and under pressure from the private sector to focus more on practical education.
But they said all efforts to bring change are politically explosive, not only because higher education is now considered a right, but also because universities absorb youths who might otherwise be unemployed.
"It's a critical situation," one ministry official said.
"The student needs to know if he's capable of doing a specific job, but the university doesn't answer that question. It's only posed when the graduate looks for a job and is told, 'You've done three years of law studies, but tens of thousands have done the same thing, so why should we choose you?' People are only now discovering that their blind faith in degrees is a fiction."
As a result, more students are now opting for two-year courses in so-called University Institutes of Technology because graduates from these schools are in greater demand than those from a conventional university.
It is not surprising, then, that they fought the wage cut.
Some experts believe students must change as much as universities.
"No one wants to stop studying before university," said Jean Barrans, a retired professor from Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse.
"Everyone wants a white-collar job and no longer accepts a blue-collar job." Professor Barrans also said that he felt French students had grown passive because only 20 percent work their way through the university.
The rest are supported by their parents or government grants.
"If they had to work to finance their studies, as in the United States," he said, "perhaps things would be better here." ALAN RIDING


SUNDAY: November 6, 1994; Lots More Drag Queens
As tobacco queens fade from sight, drag queens are becoming increasingly evident.
Whether these trends are connected is a subject for sophisticated social science.
In the simpler realm of economics Alex Heimberg, a.k.a.
Miss Understood, has started a business in Manhattan called Screaming Queens.
He provides drag queens for parties.
Their role is to amuse and entertain, like adults-only clowns.
The cost runs from $125 on up, and some clients are as straight as Rush Limbaugh.
"A women in New Jersey had us come to a party at a country club for her husband's 40th birthday," says Heimberg.
"We put a wig on him and sang 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.' They're going to be talking about us for years."


Mexican and a Kenyan Triumph in the Heat
On Wednesday, German Silva, a 26-year-old from Mexico attempting only his third race at 26.2 miles, had predicted victory in the New York City Marathon.
Yesterday, he followed through boldly, even though he made it more difficult than necessary.
Silva made a startling mistake when he took a premature turn into Central Park and had to scramble to defeat by two seconds his friend and training partner, Benjamin Paredes, in the time of 2 hours 11 minutes 21 seconds.


Portrait of the Artist as a Center Fielder
To understand Bernie Williams's approach to baseball, one need only understand his approach to life.
Both are filled with gentle rhythms and poetic flows, refreshing as the soft breezes that buffet the beaches of Puerto Rico, the island where Williams was born and now plays baseball for Arecibo Lobos el Norte when not tending to his summer job as center fielder for the New York Yankees.

On the Trail
Developments yesterday in campaigns across the country.
VIRGINIA: As if the Senate race in Virginia was not confusing enough, consider this scene yesterday at the Norfolk airport: Oliver L. North, Gov.
George Allen and Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader in the Senate, found themselves face to face with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who had just arrived to campaign for Mr.
North's Democratic opponent, Senator Charles S. Robb.
"Bob Dole, what are you doing here?" Mr.
Jackson said in mock surprise as he met them in a narrow corridor.
Mr.
Jackson shook hands with all three Republicans as well as Mr.
North -- who has made little effort to campaign before black voters.


For Niners, A Soiree Before Big Showdown
They squeezed in their aerobic workout, their players reported not a single wound and their All-World receiver discovered a new energy food.
The San Francisco 49ers began contemplating Dallas as early as today's third quarter, scoring on the Washington Redskins in blurs, and now their countdown to the Cowboys is seven days and ticking.
"It's a game I pointed out on the calendar the day I signed," said the former Cowboy linebacker Ken Norton, who jumped ship last winter to San Francisco.

Where Hope Survives Only as a Basketball
THE LAST SHOT City Streets, Basketball Dreams  By Darcy Frey 231 pages.
A Richard Todd Book/Houghton Mifflin. $19.95.
"People, they come down to Coney Island and they look at the boardwalk and all the rides and they say, 'Isn't that nice?' And then they see all those buildings behind them and they say, 'Gee, do people live back there?' Yeah, well, we live back here. There are people back here. There are lives going on here. Just because we're black doesn't mean we're stupid."
So speaks Joyce Thomas, the mother of one of the high-school basketball players whom Darcy Frey writes about so perceptively in "The Last Shot: City Streets, Basketball Dreams," a 1990's version of such 1970's factual reports as "The City Game: Basketball in New York" by Pete Axthelm and "Heaven Is a Playground" by Rick Telander.

To the Editor:
Jeffrey Grabelsky and Fred Kotler of Cornell University (letter, Oct. 31), responding to your Oct. 24 news article about discrimination against a nonunion builder on Long Island, disguise reality by raising bogus issues.

A Stereotype of Jews in Hollywood Is Revived
A British magazine has revived a stereotype of Hollywood from the early days in which a "Jewish cabal" controls the entertainment industry.
Movie executives here who have seen the article in The Spectator are outraged.
"Disgusting," "despicable," "bigoted" and "odious" are some of the words used to describe the article, titled "Kings of the Deal," which goes on to say that Jews have created an "invidious and protective culture" that denies employment to non-Jews.
And it pointedly asks, "Now that Jews govern the New Establishment does any sort of reverse form of class or racial discrimination operate against outsiders trying to get access to the entertainment highways -- Wasps, blacks, Brits and others not so favored?" The article, sprinkled with stereotypical characterizations of Jews, answers itself: "Yes."


After the Election, Fix Albany
Gov.
Mario Cuomo and his Republican challenger, State Senator George Pataki, agree on one thing.
The current legislative process in Albany is a mess.
Voters should remember this and press every state official who is elected tomorrow to shake up the closed system that has the Governor, the Senate majority leader and the Assembly Speaker deciding most major issues in secret negotiating sessions.
This goofy practice bypasses open debate of the available policy choices, delays important issues until the last hours of the session and leaves the public, and even many state legislators, out in the cold.


Monte Shooting Is a Reminder: Times Sq. Con Is Never a Game
A man watching a three-card monte game on a crowded corner of Times Square was critically wounded Saturday night by a gunman who called the dealer a cheat in front of tourists and began firing wildly when the dealer and his team of shills and spotters closed in on him menacingly.
Alerted by the shrieks of scattering crowds, a rookie police officer chased and captured a suspect and no one else was injured.
But the episode cast new light on an old and resilient con game that officials say is lucrative and far more organized and dangerous than most New Yorkers and city visitors realize.

A New-Music Feast With Flutes Ascendant
The Sonic Boom festival at the Miller Theater is a kind of co-op in sound.
New York's reputable new-music ensembles have never drawn particularly large audiences and now find themselves in debilitating intramural competitions for shrinking ones.
Sonic Boom, six concerts that began on Friday night and will run through Nov. 19, is a joint venture in contrasting musical aspirations and a shared listenership.
A restaurant analogy is not out of place, for as Friday night's tasting menu was designed to show, new music can take many turns.
The Da Capo Chamber Players, Continuum, the New York New Music Ensemble, the New Music Consort and Newband form the New York Consortium for New Music, and most of its members took turns on this program advertising the kind of music they will be presenting in individual concerts this month.


G.M. Is Getting Its Foot In the Door in Poland
The General Motors Corporation started its first venture in Poland this weekend with a fairly modest effort to assemble Opel Astras, but it said it hoped to expand its interests in this fast-growing car market.
Small though it was, the $20 million investment in a joint venture with Poland's second-largest car maker, Fabryka Samochodow Osobowych, or F.S.O., commanded a large send-off, with opening ceremonies of a new assembly plant attended by top G.M. executives and high-ranking members of the Polish Government.


Digital-Data Policies Undercut Innovation
To the Editor:
In his "Glory of Competition" (column, Oct. 31), William Safire missed the essential point that competition in industries driven by digital technology requires nonstop innovation.


Bodega Owner Shot Dead
A 54-year-old owner of a Brooklyn bodega was shot and killed yesterday during a robbery that also left one of his former employees with a gunshot wound to the head, the police said.
The shooting occurred just after 9 P.M. when the bodega owner, Salvatore Matos, and the former employee resisted several armed men who entered the store, the Espinal Bodega, at 279 Woodbine Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.
The former employee, 35, who was not identified by the police, was taken to Woodhull Hospital, where he was in stable condition.


Saatchi Direct Absorbed by Kobs
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising North America has combined its New York direct marketing operations and "infomercial" production company under its Kobs &amp; Draft Worldwide direct marketing agency.
The New York office of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Direct has been absorbed by Kobs &amp; Draft; Saatchi Direct's San Francisco office will continue operating as a separate unit.
Hudson Street Partners, the "infomercial" company, will retain its name but no longer operate separately.


Corrections
A front-page article last Monday about Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo's lead in a New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll referred incorrectly to the last time a New York governor was elected without a majority.
It was the 1966 election, when Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller got 44.6 percent of the vote against five opponents.


Israel, With New Security, Will Reopen Shrine Where 29 Died
The trouble-laden Cave of the Patriarchs shrine reopened today, but hours earlier Dina Ben-Har was in the neighboring settlement of Qiryat Arba, where she took out a book of psalms and prayed.
She stood on Sunday by the grave there of the man responsible for shutting the cave nearly nine months ago, Dr.
Baruch Goldstein, a Qiryat Arba settler who on Feb. 25 had opened fire on worshiping Palestinians with an automatic rifle, killing 29 and wounding about 125.

Caution Greets Plan On New PC
Attempting to regain the leadership roles that each once held in the personal computer market, I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc. will announce today the details of their plan to develop a shared computer design.
Many corporate buyers, companies that sell computers and computer industry consultants say they welcome the development but made clear that they were skeptical about its prospects for success.


Father and Daughter On the Idea of Home
What the actress Hallie Foote achieves by simply opening her eyes fully is a marvel of the current theater season.
Portraying Laura Lee Weems, a small-town, family-smothered spinster in "Night Seasons," the drama by her father, Horton Foote, at the Signature Theater Company, she seems at first a curtained character, absorbing the disappointments her small world deals her with a polite self-containment kept in place by a flicker of hope.
But toward the middle of the first act, there comes a moment when Laura Lee, who has just learned of the marriage of a former suitor, seems to hear one door too many closing behind her.
All Ms.
Foote does is look directly into the audience, but in such a manner that you may want to turn away.
Her gaze brims with the realization that her life is a cul-de-sac.
And though she soon steps back into the harness of civilized convention that guides her through each day, the play has acquired a haunting throb it won't shake for the rest of the evening.


As Bosnian War Intensifies, Debate Grows Over Partition Plan
In the Sarajevo office of Lieut.
Gen.
Sir Michael Rose, a map that divides Bosnia and Herzegovina under an American-backed peace plan hangs on a wall.
Gazing at it recently, an aide to the general scornfully said, "If you were a Serb, would you accept that?"
The map, prepared by the United States and four other countries as part of a peace agreement, is regarded by General Rose and the British officers who surround him as unrealistic, ill-conceived and unfair to the Bosnian Serbs.

Burstein and Vacco Battle for Voter Support
In a year when most New Yorkers seem to be focusing primarily on the race for governor, the two candidates for state attorney general have been waging distinctly different old-style campaigns as they struggle to raise money and emblazon their names on people's minds.
Karen S. Burstein, the Democratic candidate, has been rising before the sun and fighting rush-hour afternoon traffic to greet commuters at subway stops and train stations.
Yesterday, she attended church services around the city.
Her opponent, Dennis C. Vacco, the Republican candidate, has been delivering his stump speech before relatively small audiences, describing how his Italian immigrant grandparents found their American dream in Buffalo.


Kings, Queens and Commoners: A Tasting of the Windsor Stew
You'll have to wait until next week for the gossip about Di, Fergie, Anne and Camilla, but don't do any fast- forwarding.
The early episodes of "The Windsors: A Royal Family" lend surprising poignancy to the embarrassments of recent years.
The four-hour history begins with King George V, a grandson of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert (Germanic both), who took the throne in 1910.
In deference to World War I anti-Germanism, the family name was changed from Saxe Coburg Gotha or Guelph or Wettin or Whipper (nobody seems sure what it was) to the impeccably English Windsor.

Ndera Journal; Minds in Retreat From the Madness of Rwanda
The psychiatric hospital here, the only one in the country, is a window onto Rwanda's pain.
Before the civil war, there were two psychiatrists at Ndera Hospital and about 400 patients.
Now, one doctor has been killed and the other is a refugee in Zaire.
Many of the patients were massacred in April and buried in a mass grave behind the compound.
At the end of October there were about 45 patients here, most of them women and children, with more coming every day.


Bam! Sock! Thump! These Jets Are Now a Hit
You probably didn't believe it when the Jets upset the Buffalo Bills in their season opener.
Well, you probably won't believe this, either, but the Jets did it again today, and with style and fervor and outright toughness.
The Jets' 22-17 victory came in a slam-bang game in which they outhit the Bills time after time.
For the defense, it was almost a feeding frenzy, as if one Jet was saying to another, "Look at the hit I made. Can you top this?"


CHRONICLE
HADDA BROOKS always played the same role in movies of the 1940's and 50's: the sultry singer at the piano in nightclubs frequented by Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas or George Brent.
But she has not done that part since "The Bad and the Beautiful," in 1952.
Till now.
At the age of 78, she's back in her old role in the forthcoming movie "The Crossing Guard," which was written and directed by SEAN PENN .
It stars JACK NICHOLSON and ANJELICA HUSTON .

But instead of coming in and being the worst nightmare for the Eagles, Ryan found himself on the other side of a bad dream.


U.S. Rep. Dean A. Gallo, 58, New Jersey Republican, Dies
United States Representative Dean A. Gallo, a Republican from Parsippany in Morris County, N.J., who was not running for re-election, died yesterday at St.

He was 58.
He had been undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, his spokesman, Robert LeGrand, said.


They Come From Afar Just to Feel at Home
They came to run but they stayed to shop, to go to museums, to eat bagels, to see shows and to party.
For about 11,700 foreigners who made up more than 40 percent of the runners in the New York City Marathon, yesterday's race was only one part of what amounted to a mini-Olympic festival and an adventure vacation.


Press
FOR years, virtually every move at Newsday or Times Mirror, the corporate parent of the big Long Island newspaper, has brought predictions of the end of the company's expensive efforts to build a New York City paper.
That skepticism was widespread again last week when Robert M. Johnson, Newsday's publisher and an aggressive champion of New York Newsday, departed with a vague explanation about differences in "business philosophy." But instead of signaling the end of New York Newsday, last week's events may simply mark the beginning of more modest expectations for the separate edition of the Long Island paper.

In Brazilian Comic Books, Reality Plays a Leading Role
When Mauricio de Sousa, Brazil's master comic-book artist, created Monica, the main character in Brazil's best-selling comic-book series, he found some inspiration in his mischievous 2-year-old daughter.
Thirty years and 200 characters later, Mr.
Sousa looked again to real life to create one of his most recent characters, a wealthy man who wanted to buy an entire city.
Any similarity in the character to a legislator who left from the Brazilian Congress after accusations of corruption "is no mere coincidence," Mr.
Sousa said.


Using Fun to Show Blacks to Whites
A couple of genial Ivy Leaguers from "the blackest city in America," Warrington and Reginald Hudlin, have a singular reputation in Hollywood: they are the black film makers who attract all sorts of people into movie theaters by folding minority culture and politics into light entertainment.
The Hudlin brothers' films -- "House Party" in 1990 and the 1993 Eddie Murphy vehicle "Boomerang" are their best known -- contain little overt preaching and usually include a generous leavening of humor or fantasy or both.
But when the lights come up, chances are that white audience members have been to neighborhoods they might not otherwise have visited.

Foreman Reigns as Boxing's Father Time
The oldest heavyweight champion, boxing's Father Time, had stayed in the ring preaching to the HBO cameras like the evangelical minister he is.
Eventually, surrounded by cheers, he was convoyed to his dressing room and now 45-year-old George Foreman, in the same red velour trunks he had worn when knocked out by Muhammad Ali in Zaire in 1974, was sitting on a rubbing table.
The red trunks were faded, but the oldest heavyweight champion was glowing as never before.
"He got closer," he was saying of Michael Moorer, "and I hit him on the tip of the nose."


It's Time for Bengals to Celebrate: Their Winning Streak Is Up to One
Bengals 20, Seahawks 17

Essay; '94 Concession Speech
For challengers who lose tomorrow, a simple thank-you to a tearful roomful of supporters will suffice, along with a graceful recollection of Lincoln's story about a little boy who stubbed his toe and said he was too old to cry and it hurt too much to laugh.
But for incumbents about to lose longtime access to the public trough, a more sweetly embittered last hurrah on TV is permissible.
Herewith the all-purpose concession speech for ousted officeholders in 1994:


Scientology and Its German Foes: A Bitter Conflict
It would take something like an invasion of space aliens -- maybe something out of an L. Ron Hubbard science fiction novel -- to match the climate of fear and mutual suspicion that prevails between the Church of Scientology that Mr.
Hubbard created and its frightened opponents in Germany.
"Fear is part of their system -- it's a totalitarian organization that seeks to control everybody else, a dictatorship," said Ursula Caberta y Diaz, who heads the four-member working group that was set up four years ago by the Hamburg government to combat the Scientology movement and that has tried to get the courts to declare it a criminal conspiracy.

Abroad at Home; On Madison's Grave
The 30-second television spot advertisement, basic weapon of the modern American political campaign, is incompatible with the republican form of government that James Madison and his colleagues designed for this country in 1787.
So the 1994 campaign has shown us.
The Framers of the Constitution wanted a deliberative system of government.
They rejected a populist democracy, in which the public would directly decide every issue, because they thought it would risk majority tyranny and demagoguery.

Italy's Big Banks on a Merger Spree
For decades, Italy's sclerotic banking system was the ward of politicians, with overstaffed and grossly inefficient banks providing jobs and patronage and successive governments providing the money to keep the system oiled.
Now, with the Government trying to get out of the business of running the economy, and some of the biggest banks formerly owned by the state sold to private shareholders, the banks are loosening their limbs.


Silva: Detour, Stop, Reverse, Victory
The standard marathon distance is 26 miles 385 yards, unless you happen to be German Silva of Mexico, who took an alarming detour into Central Park yesterday only to slam on the brakes, retrace his steps and rescue a stirring victory from heartbreaking disaster in the strangest, closest finish ever run in the New York City Marathon.
From the 23-mile mark, Silva ran shoulder to shoulder with his countryman and training partner, Benjamin Paredes, dropping a pack of runners on a hot, humid day that claimed the life of a 27-year-old runner who went into cardiac arrest at the finish line.
Another runner, an unidentified man said to be 45 years old, also died.
These were the second and third deaths recorded in the 25 years of the New York City Marathon.

Reagan Friends Reflect on the Fading of a Giant
For a decade, Ronald Reagan was the hottest star in American politics: ever commanding, vital even in advancing age, stronger than an assassin, cancer or scandal.
And now that he has disclosed that at the age of 83 he is in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, friends and associates say, he is adjusting to his fate with a stoic and characteristic optimism.
It is they who are most distressed.
"I have observed over the last couple of years that he was fading slowly," the biographer Edmund Morris said today of his latest subject.
"And I have been tempted to compare him to the moon, which receives its light from earth. And once the light from earth diminishes, the moon grows cold."


G.O.P. APPEARS SET TO MAKE BIG GAINS IN RACE FOR HOUSE
Republicans are poised to win more seats in the House of Representatives than they have held since Dwight D. Eisenhower was President.
Indeed, after a strong campaign they could end 40 years of Democratic control in the House, history's longest period of one-party dominance there.
Democratic leaders, who worked hard this weekend to stir interest among their core voters, said they expected Republicans to gain at least 25 House seats in Tuesday's elections.
That would take the minority from the 178 seats it now holds to 203.

So Strong, So Vulnerable
Under the harsh stadium lights and in front of an assemblage of ill-tempered men who are intent on knocking him down or knocking him out, Troy Aikman, peering across the green field and about to take the snap, must block out the possibilities of catastrophe.
Monday night in Texas Stadium, the Cowboys' quarterback must look at the 11 Giants across the line and think only of X's and O's and not of X-rays or optical and cerebral damage.


Familiar Names Top List of Those Contributing to Both Cuomo and Pataki Campaigns
Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo and State Senator George E. Pataki are both receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from the same contributors -- real-estate developers, financiers, law firms, state contractors and unions -- that have long dominated campaign contribution reports.
A computer study by The New York Times identified 181 contributors who gave a total of $1.2 million to both candidates for governor, including nearly one of every six dollars raised by Mr.
Cuomo in the last four years.

Germany's Workers
To the Editor:
In "G.M. Success in an Unlikely Place" (Business Day, Oct. 31) you find it perplexing that General Motors has discovered a motivated and efficient work force at its auto plant in formerly Communist East Germany.
While you offer interesting reasons for this phenomenon, your comparison of the labor force in Eisenach with that of American green-field sites is far-fetched.

The Political Mind-Set Shows Inconsistencies
The problem with the resolution of a major college football season is not the absence of a playoff or the existence of an unwieldy bowl structure that can prevent an obvious championship matchup from taking place.
There is a much deeper flaw, a mind-set unlike that of any other sport, one that demands both perfection and punishment and penalizes those who fail to deliver both.
If a top-ranked college basketball team can overcome the obstacles of injuries and environment to defeat an inferior team, its survival is considered a sign of resilience.
But when Penn State allowed the already defeated Indiana Hoosiers to score on a deflected 40-yard touchdown pass and a feel-good 2-point conversion pass in the Nittany Lions' 35-29 victory here Saturday, its championship possibilities may have absorbed a pivotal and unjust blow.


Writers Fight for Electronic Rights
The question of who owns the rights to reproduce articles in new electronic media has plunged the magazine industry into its most bitter battle in years.
It is pitting writers against publishers and causing much of the industry to rewrite contracts for freelancers.
The heart of the matter is whether writers should get a share of the proceeds if their work is reproduced on CD-ROM's, data bases, on-line services or in other new electronic media outlets.
A similar fight is being waged in the book industry between publishers and their authors.

Prayers and Tears for 2 Carolina Boys
Anybody who was anybody in Union County was there, grieving beside people who were nobody in particular.
Men who do not even own a tie sat in pews with judges, and doctors and millworkers stared with wet eyes at a single tiny coffin shared by two little boys.
Their anguished father, David Smith, wept on the shoulders of family and friends as 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alexander were prayed over at the Buffalo United Methodist Church and then laid to rest in a little mill town cemetery, and more than 1,000 mourners cried and suffered with him.


Sports of The Times By HARVEY ARATON; Painfully, That Sneak Boomer Is a Hero Again
THIS time, with fourth-and-inches, with the game on the line, with a bunch of jobs likely at stake, Pete Carroll went with Boomer Esiason's bum ankle instead of his suspect left arm.
The point is that he went with him, period, when half of Giants Stadium might have preferred a Brian Hansen punt, with the hope of a Buffalo fumble 40 yards down field.


CHRONICLE
NEIL SIMON is being honored by Lenox Hill Hospital at its annual Autumn Ball on Wednesday.
And for what?
The way he makes people feel better.
The theme of the evening is Laughter Is the Best Medicine.
At the benefit, to be held at the Waldorf, Mr.
Simon will receive the hospital's Medal of Distinction from ALAN ALDA , a friend and star of his play "Jake's Women."


At Church, the Sermon Is Often How You Vote
He hammered the pulpit with both fists, speaking so forcefully that no worshiper here today could miss his point.
Just in case, O. C. Collins Jr., pastor of the Bethlehem Missionary Baptist Church, stared down his parishioners and delivered a message that sounded more like a warning than a sermon:
"I want everybody here to understand that you give not one Republican a vote out of Bethlehem," Dr.
Collins implored, bringing hundreds in this all-black congregation on the north side of town to their feet.
"Don't shame your forefathers. Don't shame your children."


Solos to 'Blue Moon' by Elvis And Sounds of a Farmyard
Wendy Perron is a performer with a haunting, fugitive eloquence.
She seems both present and absent onstage.
That quality permeated "Solos With Memories," one of three new dances Ms.
Perron presented on Thursday night at the Danspace at St.
Mark's Church in the East Village.
The triptych of solos was performed to Elvis Presley's singing of "Blue Moon" over a muted background of farmyard clip-clop, rooster-crowing sounds.
Each dance alluded to character and situation, but only obliquely.
Each character seemed to be living in the private world of the imagination.


Corrections
An article yesterday about Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo's handling of a 1991 murder case on Staten Island referred incorrectly to the victim.
Leslie Holtz was a man.

Senate Foes, Fearing '93, Try to Woo Undecideds
Frank R. Lautenberg and Chuck Haytaian spent the weekend pleading for votes from flea market shoppers and churchgoers, trying to sway the undecided vote that is likely to decide their Senate race.
The camps of both Mr.
Lautenberg, the Democratic incumbent, and Mr.
Haytaian, the Republican challenger, claimed to be gaining support.
But the last independent polls before Tuesday's vote showed that perhaps a third of New Jersey's notoriously volatile electorate could yet shift allegiance.


Sounds to Blend Into the Woodwork
Ambient music, the main event over the weekend at the Kitchen's new Electronic Cafe, has a longer history than one might think.
Brian Eno first codified a philosophy of sound as atmosphere in the 1970's; long before him, though, Erik Satie introduced the notion of musique d'ameublement, a furniture music that the audience was supposed to hear with comfortable inattention.
And in a sense, much music written before Haydn and Mozart was ambient: the Baroque genre of Tafel musik, or table music, was intended as background for aristocratic dinner conversation.
Modern ambient music, however, makes more complex demands.
It does not serve as the background for unrelated events; rather, like certain modes of Minimalism, it aims to wrap the audience in its sensuous embrace, excluding more conscious forms of activity.
Rather than sitting composedly in chairs, listeners lie on the floor, or maybe dance.
Ambient music overlaps heavily with the dense, overwhelming dance sound of techno and rave.


U.S. Oil and Gas Companies Test Waters in Brazil, Again
Oil and gas companies from the United States are returning to Brazil, their first major effort since 1953, after being effectively excluded for four decades by the country's old nationalist and protectionist policies.
American oil-service companies, sometimes called the pilot fish of the big international producers, turned out in force last month at the Brazilian Petroleum Congress.
Competing for an annual market estimated at $1 billion in sales and contracts, 47 American oil-service companies mounted stands here.

The 4 Possible Governors On a Final Weekend Tour
John G. Rowland toured western Connecticut with busloads of supporters today, rallying Republicans in the part of the state that nearly elected him Governor in 1990.
The final poll before the election showed him holding on to a statistically insignificant lead in the four-way governor's race.
Comptroller William E. Curry Jr., the Democrat, who has generally held second place in the polls, spoke at churches and rallies in the New Haven area, while Lieut.
Gov.
Eunice S. Groark of A Connecticut Party, third in polls but gaining, spent the day contesting Mr.
Rowland in Fairfield County.

'SEI,' 15, Is First to Be Arrested By New Police Anti-Graffiti Unit
A new citywide police squad to combat graffiti vandalism made its first arrest Saturday night, picking up a 15-year-old who is a suspect in 10 incidents of vandalism in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
The 25-member unit went into operation on Oct. 30 as part of a larger police strategy to crack down on the "quality of life" crimes, like prostitution, aggressive panhandling, loud radio playing and public beer drinking, that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has called "visible signs of a city out of control." In the past, the police in individual precincts worked with citizens' groups to attack graffiti vandalism.

Something to Lose Those Baseball and Hockey Blues
Could there actually be a professional sport besides football to watch and to read about?
Finally, there is.
The papers were filled with pro basketball box scores over the weekend, long-awaited numbers that will remain a constant until June, lessening the sting of the long-lost baseball season and the vanishing hockey season.


Making Old Cadet Attitudes Die -- or Just Fade Away
Erin Burns spends most of her time here pulling her weight in a male world: clambering up 15-foot ropes, forcing her body through two minutes of pushups, making her voice deep to command a platoon of men during grueling weeklong bivouacs in muddy woods.
But she has also learned her strengths as a woman, learned that many of her male colleagues value her not just because she can compete in their world but because they have trouble competing in hers.


Beard (No Forest Ranger) Is Forever Putting Out Fires
The job listing said coach.
Butch Beard must be wondering why the Nets did not advertise the position as forest ranger.

Arson is suspected.
An inside job, clearly.


3 Arrested in Pastor's Death In Queens Church Robbery
In the end, the Rev.
Jong Kyu Kim probably was shot and killed because he did not have enough money to give his robbers, who thought that his humble church in Queens was a prosperous car service, law-enforcement officials said yesterday.
And he most likely was alive when the three men set him on fire to cover their crime, a detective said.
These details about the last moments of Mr.
Kim, a 41-year-old Presbyterian minister, emerged yesterday during a news conference at which officials announced the arrest of three suspects, one of whom was 15 when the pastor was murdered on Aug. 27.

American Cites Intimidation by Singapore Over Article He Wrote
An American economist who left Singapore last month said today that he would not return here because he was fearful of being imprisoned over a newspaper opinion article published in Singapore in which he criticized "intolerant regimes" in Asia.
The State Department has protested the treatment of the economist, Christopher Lingle, who was interrogated by the Singapore police twice last month as a result the article, which appeared in The International Herald Tribune on Oct. 7.


Corrections
A picture caption on Saturday about an appearance by Gov.

He was Mayor Jerry Jennings of Albany, not Rabbi Joseph Potasnic.


2 Art Forms Lovingly Intertwine
Music and dance don't really need each other.
Music is a self-sufficient art.
And choreographers have created fine works to speech, noises or silence.
Usually, however, music has been their favorite accompaniment.
So, too, composers have frequently been inspired by dance rhythms.
The interplay between music and dance was emphasized in "Recital With Dance," the program of compositions by Stravinsky and Ravel presented on Saturday night at the 92d Street Y by the violinist Young Uck Kim and Steffan Scheja, a pianist, who were joined in their final selection by two stars of the New York City Ballet, Darci Kistler and Nikolaj Hubbe.


Officials Say U.S. to Cut Forces in Haiti and Kuwait
In a decision that carries political as well as military significance, President Clinton has decided to withdraw thousands of troops from Haiti and the Persian Gulf, Administration officials said today.
They said the President would withdraw 6,000 Americans from Haiti by Dec. 1, leaving 9,000 troops to help bolster security there.
The President would also pull out virtually all 7,800 American ground troops in Kuwait by late December, the officials said.
They were deployed in October after the Iraq's elite Republican Guards moved toward Kuwait and appeared ready to threaten the country.

China's Power Needs Exceed Investor Tolerance
As China's supply of electrical power falls more and more behind its surging demand, the nation's Communist Party leadership is paralyzed by an ideological struggle over how much profit foreign investors should be allowed to make from the power industry.
With economic growth of nearly 12 percent predicted this year, China is failing to meet its goals for adding power generation.
Blackouts are plaguing the largest industrial centers like Shanghai, and shortages are cutting deeply into productivity nationwide.


CHRONICLE
ROSA PARKS , the 81-year-old matriarch of the civil-rights movement, who is being honored a peace festival in Stockholm, will soon have a prize in her name, The Associated Press reported.
The organizers of One Day of Peace, a Swedish-American festival, told Mrs.
Parks on Friday they were creating the Rosa Parks Peace Prize and would ask her to help in choosing its first winner next year, the 40th anniversary of her historic refusal to give up her seat to a white man on a bus in Montgomery, Ala.
The prize will be endowed by donations from Swedish corporations and citizens.


Movement Enhances 'Our Town's' Poignancy
It takes a brave man to buck a trend.
But Philip Jerry's "Our Town," performed by the American Repertory Ballet here tonight at the State Theater, is not just an unfashionable narrative dance.
The piece is also based on a play that develops slowly and is full of nuances of a sort not easily expressed in ballet.
Mr.
Jerry's dance, dedicated to his mother, is filled with the spirit of the Thornton Wilder classic, but it also succeeds in dramatic and pure dance terms.
Mr.
Jerry's retelling of the story is fairly simple.
He introduces these small-town characters promptly in a seamless flow of small encounters and events.
He establishes young Emily Webb's relationship with her parents immediately, at the same time creating a sense of her tumultuous embrace of life.
Her growing love for handsome young George Gibbs is also clearly charted, as is his initially bashful love for her.
Emily's death and return are handled with an almost painful simplicity as well as a good deal of ingenious staging.


Reagan's Illness Afflicts Millions, in Varying Ways
In disclosing on Saturday that he had developed Alzheimer's disease, former President Ronald Reagan said he wanted to make more people aware of the incurable illness, which is characterized by progressive mental and physical deterioration and which afflicts some four million Americans.
Many doctors are now applauding Mr.
Reagan's announcement, saying they expect it to lead to greater public awareness of Alzheimer's, just as Mr.
Reagan's surgery for colon cancer in 1985 heightened awareness of that disease.

From the Andes, Indians Spread the Word: They're Argentine and Proud of It
Some 12,300 feet above sea level in the Andes Mountains, Coya Indians were laughing, waving, pointing and jumping for joy the other day as a tourist train pulled into the station of this isolated mining village.
The Indians, whose ancestors established the village more than 300 years ago to escape Spanish domination, come to the train station every Saturday to sell their handicrafts, receive donations of food and clothing, and read old newspapers that have been left on the train.

Legal Euthanasia Imperils Medical Integrity; Evading the Guidelines
To the Editor:
In citing alleged Catholic support for the "morphine drip" as a covert method of euthanasia for the terminally ill ("Killing Pain, Ending Life," Op-Ed, Nov. 1), Thomas A. Preston skews Catholic teaching in order to support his own political agenda.

Legal Euthanasia Imperils Medical Integrity
To the Editor:
Thomas A. Preston's critique of physicians' use of the "morphine drip" to alleviate the suffering of terminally ill patients ("Killing Pain, Ending Life," Op-Ed, Nov. 1) is misleading.
It is clear that Dr.
Preston's agenda is to desensitize society to euthanasia by equating this practice with the legitimate use of morphine in dying patients.


It Seems the Finish Rate Is Up, Up and Away
Two years after a surge of runners led marathon organizers to adopt stringent controls to keep the race manageable, the controls evaporated in the November heat yesterday as participation in the 25th New York City Marathon shattered all previous records.
Based on unofficial preliminary tallies subject to revision, a total of 29,543 runners had crossed the finish line by the new 10-hour cutoff.
Among other things, that is 1,746 more than the 1992 record of 27,797, a 6 percent increase, and almost 3,000 more than the 26,597 who finished last year.


Republican Leader Practices Nonchalance in Tough Campaign
He has never been accused of being at a loss for words, but Newt Gingrich needs only two to respond to speculation that his race for Congress in suburban Atlanta may not be the cakewalk that had been anticipated.
"Who cares?" Mr.
Gingrich said before addressing the pumped-up Republicans checking out T-shirts and bumper stickers reading "Bill Lied," "Visualize No Liberals" and "Rush for President" inside Vittle's Restaurant here on Saturday.


Tilting East
President Clinton's theme of putting the economy first takes him this week to Indonesia for the second annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting.
APEC is an 18-member group of Pacific Rim countries that includes China and Japan.
On the agenda is a proposal to create by 2020 the world's largest free-trade and investment zone -- a dramatic symbol of America's tilt toward soaring opportunities in Asia and away from the enervated economies of Western Europe.
Mr.
Clinton pushed Nafta, the accord with Mexico and Canada, through Congress over the opposition of important Democratic constituencies.
He also signed, along with more than 100 trading partners, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- which Congress will vote on after the elections.
An APEC accord is an enticing next step.
APEC members account for about half of the world's economic output; yet the U.S. share of trade and investment in the group is falling.
A trade agreement would guarantee fair access, a key to U.S. growth.


Holocaust Heroine Recalled
The stage of the Producer's Club Theater is cramped.
Nevertheless, Linda Diamond's "Secret Annex" would have seemed claustrophobic even at the Metropolitan Opera House.
This solo for Lois Silk, inspired by "The Diary of Anne Frank," successfully conveyed a sense of confinement.
It was the only work on the program that Linda Diamond &amp; Company offered on Friday night that had any impact.
Ms.
Diamond's other pieces involved little more than self-conscious posing.


As Rostenkowski's Challenger Shows a Surge, a Sleepy Campaign Stirs
Lost in the flutter over big-name politicians fighting for their lives in Texas and California and Virginia has been a nearly forgotten campaign that got into gear only a few days ago, amid murmurs of something that few people thought possible.
Dan Rostenkowski, the wounded general, could be in a race after all.
In this overwhelmingly Democratic city, the 18-term Congressman and former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee was thought to have survived his biggest test by winning the Democratic primary in a three-way fight under a cloud of impending corruption charges.

Patents; A Jet-Powered Disk With Added Lift From Helium Can Take Off Straight Up, Float and Carry 800 Passengers
A RETIRED aerospace engineer has designed an aircraft that can take off straight up -- even from water -- float and carry up to 800 passengers.
It looks remarkably like a flying saucer.
The engineer, George Neumayr, retired a few years ago after 20 years as a design engineer for the Bell Aerospace Company in New York and moved to Lake Worth, Fla.
For the last couple of years he has spent most of his time designing his flying disk at a small drafting table and typewriter at home.


Iran Fires Missiles At Rebel Base in Iraq
Iran carried out a missile attack against a military base of the exiled People's Mujahedeen near Baghdad, Iraq, early today after the rebels tried to attack Iranian oil installations, the Teheran radio said.
The radio reported heavy casualties, adding that two guerrillas were pursued into Iraq.

In Texas Race, A Bush Avoids Father's Errors
When he talks about his effort to unseat Gov.
Ann W. Richards, George W. Bush refers a lot to a campaign two years ago in which a relative came a cropper.
"Bill Clinton drove the agenda against my father," Mr.
Bush said the other day as he stumped across the plains of western Texas.
"My father let Bill Clinton decide what issues the two of them were going to talk about. That was a major mistake, and I wasn't going to let it happen to me this year."


NEW YORK CITY MARATHON: Sports of The Times; In All the Boroughs, the Crowds Came Out to Honor Lebow
THERE is a place in Brooklyn where Fred Lebow used to shout in Yiddish.
He would see the Hasidic Jews standing on the sidewalk and he would stand up in the pace car and exhort them to cheer, to clap, to support the runners.
The crowds were sparse in Williamsburg back then, and the Hasidic men in their suits and long black coats mostly stared back at Lebow.
What was a man who looked just like them doing in a gaudy track outfit, standing up in an open car, shouting at them?


CUOMO AND PATAKI STRESSING THEMES DOWN TO THE WIRE
The leading New York gubernatorial candidates edged toward the finish line yesterday by doubling back to what each believes is his most potent theme: State Senator George E. Pataki argued once more that he is the candidate of tax cuts and change, and Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo kept up questions about his rival's record and honesty on the litmus issue of abortion.
With both camps sensing a close and volatile race, the candidates relied on last-minute help from -- and contrasting appeals to -- the biggest group of undecided voters: women.
Mr.
Pataki wrapped himself in the Republican tax-cutting credentials of Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey on a walking tour of Little Italy, while Mr.
Cuomo basked in the embrace of a bipartisan group, including Donna Hanover Giuliani, who questioned Mr.
Pataki's commitment to abortion rights.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Small movie, small budget, big hopes. It's a situation that really calls for a full-court press.
STATISTIC ONE: The typical advertising budget for a major Hollywood film is $15 million or more.
Statistic Two: the advertising budget for "Hoop Dreams," an independent film that has won rave reviews and a cult following, is $500,000.
"That represents what the major studios might spend on just one day of advertising," said Ira Deutchman, president of Fine Line Features, the film's distributor in Manhattan.
Mr.
Deutchman, who distributed "The Player," "Barcelona" and "My Own Private Idaho," is wringing every penny of value from his budget for "Hoop Dreams," trying to make a small film into a big phenomenon.

At Least 32 Die as Rainstorms Pummel Northern Italy
The rains came and the river banks broke, and by tonight, there were at least 32 people dead and more than a dozen missing in the fastest-rising floods to strike northern Italy in eight decades.
The freak rain that pummeled southern Europe and northern Africa hit hardest in the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy.
In the area around Turin, the torrents flowed unchecked through homes and across fields, bringing down telephone and power lines, blocking highways and buckling bridges.

Even Marathon Is Political
In the homestretch of the governor's race yesterday, not even the New York City Marathon was free of political controversy.
Late in the day, about 25 Hasidic Jews from Williamsburg in Brooklyn appeared at City Hall to complain that police officers had taken down posters for George E. Pataki from lampposts along the route there in the early morning, saying that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had ordered that there be no political signs along the race.

On the Trail
Developments yesterday in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. NEW YORK
Governor: Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo and State Senator George E. Pataki spanned the state, the Governor talking about abortion rights and Mr.
Pataki about tax cuts.
Comptroller: Another crack in the G.O.P. front: John Daly, a Republican State Senator from Niagara, endorsed Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, over the Republican, Herbert London.

Foley Wages Lonely Fight To Keep Job Of 30 Years
As President Clinton campaigned today on the western side of this state, his party's leader in the House of Representatives, Speaker Thomas S. Foley, went looking for votes in the most remote, snowbound region of eastern Washington.
Keeping that sort of distance from the President has been Mr.
Foley's strategy since last month, when polls had him 18 points behind.
Mr.
Clinton was at a rally for several other Democrats.


Commuting
Continuing a trend that began last winter, ridership is up on the region's commuter railroads and bus lines while vehicle traffic into Manhattan is down.
Transit officials largely credited last winter's harsh weather with enticing commuters out of their cars and onto trains and buses.
But aggressive marketing campaigns, the improving economy and improved service are also factors in reversing years of declining ridership.
Traffic at toll bridges and tunnels into Manhattan was down about 4 percent in the first eight months of 1994 from the first eight months of 1993.
The figure does not include statistics for the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, which had abnormally low volume in 1993 because of the World Trade Center bombing.


A Busy Day for Emergency Crews
The more than 500 medical personnel -- doctors, paramedics, medical technicians and volunteers -- clustered near the finish line of the New York City Marathon were ready for anything yesterday.
And they got it.
The combination of the 68-degree temperature and unusually high humidity produced two fatal heart attacks, dozens of cases of heat stroke and hundreds of lesser cases of dehydration, heat exhaustion and leg cramps.


Clinton Tries Candor About Low Standing in Pitch for Party
On the final Sunday of the campaign, President Clinton flew here and even appeared on "Larry King Live" in hopes of aiding embattled Democratic Congressional candidates around the country.
It was Mr.
Clinton's second visit to the state in just two weeks, and the obstacles he faced were emblematic of all he has had to battle in what has been an unpleasant election season.


Corrections
An article on Saturday about the race in New York's 14th Congressional District misstated an assessment of the Republican candidate, City Councilman Charles Millard, by the New York Public Interest Research Group.
The group cited Mr.
Millard in March 1993 as having cast the most dissenting votes on the mostly Democratic Council; it did not call him its most independent member.


The Woman Who Invented Scarlett
This being a sweeps month, in which ratings determine future ad revenues, the networks are struggling to think big in terms of prime-time programming.
And what could be bigger than "Gone With the Wind"?
There's no competing, of course, with the 1939 Oscar-laden movie classic adapted from Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel, but don't underestimate the rip-off wiles of the entertainment industry.
On Sunday, CBS introduces its eight-hour mini-series "Scarlett," based on Alexandra Ripley's recent sequel to the Mitchell story.
And tonight, not to be outdone by a multi-million-dollar production, NBC rushes obliquely into the Scarlett O'Hara sweepstakes with a drably modest television movie called "A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell Story."

He is a bridge inspector by trade.

"Vote for Cuomo!" his booming voice yelled to passersby.
"If you value your children, Vote for Cuomo. Re-elect Mario Cuomo."

Day After Is Tough for Both the Winners (Flanders) and the Losers (Devil His Due)
On the day after the Breeders' Cup, only one issue was unassailable: the 3-year-old champion and the Horse of the Year was the great gray colt Holy Bull, untouched and undisturbed in his stall a thousand miles away in Florida while the toll was being counted at Churchill Downs.
The chief victims of the day were Lure, who lost the chance to become the leading grass horse when he ran ninth in the Mile, and Devil His Due, who may have lost the chance to become the leading older horse when he ran 11th in the Classic.
And adding insult to injury, the Devil was ordered to stay at Churchill Downs during the tax dispute between the Internal Revenue Service and the Lion Crest Stable, which won't be resolved for three weeks.


Few Knew of White House Suspect's Turmoil
Until he fired 27 rounds from a semiautomatic rifle at the White House last Saturday, the plainest indication that Francisco M. Duran had a violent edge came on a summer night in 1990, when a fight outside a bowling alley led to his dishonorable discharge from the Army.
Yet few of those closest to him knew exactly what had happened -- not his mother, not his brothers.
They knew his service as an Army medic had been his proudest achievement.
They would only find out later about what Frank Duran regarded as his biggest failure.

Foreman Strikes A Solid Blow For the Ages
George Foreman crossed the line between athlete and icon Saturday night.

On about three-quarters of all bridge deals, neither partnership owns the 26 high-card points indicating that game should be bid.
And on those deals it is more likely than not that both sides will be bidding.
Judging how far to bid in these competitive auctions is crucial, and not well understood.
The first major book on this subject was the best-selling "To Bid or Not to Bid: The Law of Total Tricks," by Larry Cohen, published two years ago.

London and McCall Clash As Tough Race Nears End
The candidates for state comptroller, looking weary near the end of a hard-fought race, worked to shore up their core constituencies yesterday as the incumbent Democrat returned to his old State Senate district in Harlem and his Republican rival shook hands with Jewish voters on bustling 13th Avenue in Brooklyn.
It was a fitting closing image in a campaign that has turned more on race and personal attacks than on the duties of office.
But the politicking yesterday was aimed at the necessities of solid turnout in a tight contest: H. Carl McCall, the Democrat, who is black, needs to insure his supporters will go to the polls, and Herbert London, the Republican who is white and Jewish, wants to sway crucial undecided voters.

Weary of Chemotherapy, Teen-Ager With Cancer Runs Away
Tired of the nausea, the exhaustion, the aches and the malaise caused by his chemotherapy treatments, Billy Best, a 16-year-old high school student who is battling cancer, apparently decided to try to run away from his troubles.
Billy, who is suffering from Hodgkin's disease, a form of lymphatic cancer, left his home in this town 20 miles southwest of Boston 10 days ago.
"The reason I left is because I could not stand going to the hospital every week," he wrote in a farewell note, his parents said.
"I feel like the medicine is killing me instead of helping me."

Kenyan Runs Far Away From Doubts
Tegla Loroupe, a woman of such disarming diffidence that it took her two years to tell New York City Marathon officials they were misspelling her name, stamped her mark on road-racing history yesterday when she became the first black African woman to win a major marathon.
Typically, Loroupe, a 21-year-old Kenyan who had won the 6.2-mile Advil Mini Marathon in 1993 as Tecla Loroupe but had never run more than a half marathon, had given herself no chance yesterday.


High School Rivalry Gets Personal; Cross-Country Teams Caught in Dispute Fueled by Adults
On the grassy, softly sloping field of the State University campus here, hundreds of teen-age boys and girls competed today in a state cross-country championship.
For the girls' teams from Saratoga Springs High School and Shenendehowa High, the rivalry was particularly sharp.
Off the track, the Saratoga Springs runners are enmeshed in a conflict over whether their coaches, Linda and Arthur Kranick, are dedicated, health-conscious mentors or control freaks who have forced their runners to take large doses of vitamins.
The chief accusers are Camille and William Karl, whose three daughters once ran for the Kranicks and now run for Shenendehowa High, 20 miles away in Clifton Park.
The key question regarding them is: Are they motivated purely out of concern for their children's health or are they seeking revenge for a decision by Mrs.
Kranick that pushed their daughter Elizabeth off the cross-country varsity squad last fall?

Mr. Pataki's Odd Attack
State Senator George Pataki has chosen an odd case to dramatize his stand for the death penalty and attack Gov.
Mario Cuomo as soft on crime.
The case of Thomas Grasso, a twice-convicted murderer, is not a test of toughness but rather a test of fidelity to law, and the winner is the Governor.
Last week the Republican challenger stood outside a Staten Island boarding house where Mr.
Grasso killed an 81-year-old fellow resident in 1991 and accused Governor Cuomo of refusing, arbitrarily and on ideological grounds, to send Mr.
Grasso to Oklahoma where he is under a death sentence for a murder there.
He repeated the bogus charge over the weekend, perhaps hoping to close the campaign with a last round of death-penalty politics.
The facts show that Mr.
Pataki's charge is simplistic and fanciful.


Legal Euthanasia Imperils Medical Integrity; Pain Management
To the Editor:
I am responding to Dr.
Thomas A. Preston's thought-provoking, troubling and ultimately misleading Op-Ed article ("Killing Pain, Ending Life," Nov. 1).
The case he describes is far from adequate for making medical and ethical decisions about appropriate care.
From the short description given, I wonder why a person with "intermittent" pain was placed on a continuous infusion of morphine.
In addition, morphine drips for pain management are supposed to be adjusted to maintain patient comfort, not to intentionally decrease respiration.
I wonder if the case described was an example of poor medical management rather than an appropriate indictment of an extremely valuable and perhaps underused therapy.


Treasury Plans to Auction Bills and Notes
The schedule of Treasury financings this week includes only bills and notes, beginning with today's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills.
The Government will auction three-year notes on Tuesday and 10-year notes on Wednesday.
On Thursday, the Government will auction 37-day cash-management bills and one-year bills.
By the close of the New York cash market on Friday, traders said, the rate for the outstanding three-month bill was 5.17 percent and the rate for the six-month bill was 5.61 percent; the rate for a one-year bill was 5.98 percent.
In when-issued trading, the three-year note was being offered at a rate to yield 7.40 percent and the 10-year note was being offered at a rate to yield 8.02 percent.

Cuomo and Pataki End Bitter, Costly Race
Mario M. Cuomo and George E. Pataki ended the most expensive -- and arguably the most negative -- gubernatorial campaign in state history yesterday with passionate entreaties for unity and bold predictions of victory, leaving 8.8 million New York registered voters to choose whether to end or extend 20 years of Democratic rule in Albany.
In casting their ballots today, voters also will determine whether New York will elect a black official to statewide office for the first time and whether it will become the first state in the country to elect an openly homosexual candidate to statewide office.
The results are likely to leave their imprint on the state's politics for years and could have a lasting impact on the careers not only of the candidates but also of their leading surrogates, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the state's Republican Senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato.

Males May Want to Heed A Tip From the Guppies On How to Attract a Mate
GENTLEMEN!
Ask yourselves the following question.
If you were hoping to attract the woman of your fantasies over to your table in a bar, would you rather be sitting next to a guy who looks like Mel Gibson, or like Jerry Lewis in "The Nutty Professor"?
Against which backdrop are you likelier to shine, or even appear visible at all?
Think carefully and realistically -- the future of your chromosomes may depend upon it.
Scientists have devoted thousands of hours studying the details of how female animals choose their mates and how that pickiness drives the evolution of male finery and flamboyance.
They have also looked at how males fight one another for access to those females, engaging in ritualistic displays of sound and fury known among biologists as male-male competition.

In most other respects this has been an exhausting and gloomy campaign season, marked by a poisonous mood among many voters and relentless negative advertising from the candidates.
The poll results have gyrated wildly, and as late as last night there was still a large undecided vote in many crucial contests across the nation.
Today -- Election Day -- the advertising will mercifully end and so, finally, will the suspense.
Suddenly, all those opinion polls do not mean anything.
Just ask President Dewey: What really matters is who turns out to vote.
People who stay home, either out of indifference or overconfidence, can in fact make a huge difference.
To take an example close to home, the volatile races for governor and comptroller in New York State could be decided by a small number of votes.


Serb Is First to Face Post-World War II War-Crimes Indictment
The first international war crimes tribunal since the end of World War II made its first indictment today, charging the former commander of a concentration camp operated by the Bosnian Serbs with murder, torture and mutilation of Muslim prisoners.
The Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, formed by the United Nations a year ago, accused the commander, Dragan Nikolic, of killing eight Muslim prisoners, torturing seven others and illegally imprisoning more than 500 other Bosnian Muslims.


Peekskill Finds That Fame Can Be a Pain

Just One Big, Neurotic Family In a Musical on Group Therapy
Group therapy is a humiliating ritual in which whining neurotics sit around in a circle tearing one another to shreds until everyone is reduced into a quivering heap of guilt and shame.
Right?
Wrong.
As "Inside Out," a smart, spunky little musical at the Cherry Lane Theater shows, the typical therapy group is more likely to be a sympathetic, supportive extended family whose members are everyday people with everyday hang-ups.
As in any family, squabbles are inevitable.
But as the group members work on their issues, sometimes by pretending to exchange identities in carefully supervised confrontations, they develop broader and healthier views of themselves.

Syracuse And B.C. Duel for Bowl Bids
When asked yesterday if he had heard any bowl-game talk, Boston College's Dan Henning said: "I don't know anything about bowls. All we know about is Syracuse."
It was a predictable reply as Henning is one of those coaches who hates to look beyond Saturday's game for fear the future might bite him.
Nevertheless, the bowl season has begun -- at least the speculative part -- and the outcome of the Eagles' game against the Orange at Chesnut Hill, Mass., will figure in the picture.

Reagan and Alzheimer's: Following Path His Mother Traveled
Before Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980, he said publicly he wanted to be watched for senility, in part because his mother, Nellie, had been senile for several years before her death at the age of 80.
Now, nearly six years after he left the White House, after serving two terms as President, Mr.
Reagan has said he has Alzheimer's disease.
A statement from his doctors said he was "entering the early stages of this disease." It is characterized by progressive mental and physical deterioration, which can occur swiftly or over a period of years.


Angolan Rebels Said to Begin Retreat From Last Stronghold
The rebels who have locked Angola in a ruinous power struggle for two decades have begun an orderly retreat from their last important bastion, the city of Huambo in the central highlands, according to reports today from relief workers there.
The aid workers disputed claims by the Angolan military that the rebel stronghold had already fallen, but they said there seemed to be no doubt that the army was sweeping slowly toward the city and would have full control within a day or two.

Judge in Simpson Trial Allows TV Camera in Courtroom
To the relief of millions of voyeurs, court buffs and civic-minded students of the criminal justice system, Judge Lance A. Ito ruled today that a single television camera can remain in his courtroom for the trial of O. J. Simpson.
While some pretrial hearings could still conceivably be closed, continuous coverage of the eventual trial now seems all but certain.
As Mr.
Simpson sat nearby, intermittently attentive, Judge Ito spent much of the morning invoking the perils of television, including nervous witnesses, grandstanding lawyers and salacious sound bites.
He repeatedly referred to the carnival-like televised trials a generation ago of Dr.
Sam Sheppard on murder charges and Billie Sol Estes on charges of fraud.
At his side were 21 boxes filled with more than 15,000 letters, most of which, he said, had urged him to pull the plug.


Candidates Crisscross the State In Whirlwind End for Campaigns
With 16-hour days and frenetic schedules that had them crisscrossing the state, Frank R. Lautenberg, the Democratic incumbent, and his Republican challenger, Chuck Haytaian, wound up their campaigns today for the United States Senate.
Mr.
Haytaian's last full day on the campaign trail began and ended in his political base of Warren County in northwest New Jersey and included appearances with both Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman and the minority leader of the Senate, Robert Dole of Kansas.


E. E. Kelm, 83, Chief Executive Of Cargill, Dies
Erwin E. Kelm, who led Cargill Inc. through a period of rapid growth in the 1970's that helped propel the agribusiness giant to its position as the nation's largest family-owned company, died on Sunday at his home in Minneapolis after a lengthy struggle with heart disease, the company said yesterday.
He was 83.
Mr.
Kelm spent his entire career at Cargill, joining the company as a barley and grain trader after graduating from the University of Minnesota in 1933 with a marketing degree.
As chief executive from 1961 until his retirement in 1977, he was the only person to head Cargill who was not a Cargill or a MacMillan, the two families related by marriage that own the 129-year-old company.

AIDS RESEARCH GRANTS CUT IN NEW YORK
As a patient in AIDS research trials, Gilbert Jackson receives a level of care he hardly knew existed: vitamins, information about his disease, gentle handling and the possibility that the experimental drugs will prolong his life.
But the study is being phased out.
New York City is losing three of its four community-based clinical trials, a decision that is prompting outrage and igniting a debate on whether there is a right to participate in clinical trials.

Clinton Makes Final Push to Stem Democratic Losses
President Clinton made an election eve dash to Minnesota, Michigan and Delaware, hoping that he could turn a Senate race in at least one of those states to the Democrats' favor and save his party from substantial losses across the country today.
But a hint of bitterness, if not resignation, crept into Mr.
Clinton's hoarse voice as he wound up his eighth straight day criss-crossing the nation on behalf of imperiled Democrats.
Sounding alternately upbeat and frustrated, the President implored people to vote and spoke almost retrospectively of a tormented electorate, and of how Republicans had spoiled his legislative agenda.

Political commercials during this election season have been overwhelmingly negative.
ONCE again, political advertising has accomplished a feat that Madison Avenue has never been able to achieve: making conventional product advertising look good, if only by comparison.

Saturday Movies and Sunday Moves
The Jets, like all other pro football teams, have a pre-game ritual -- "Saturday Night at the Movies." For most teams, these movies or videotapes feature the next day's opponent.
They are more "Basic Blocking and Tackling" than "Basic Instinct."
Pete Carroll, the Jets' first-year coach, believes in keeping his players relaxed, so his Saturday night movies have been different.
One night, a Three Stooges show was spliced into the middle of football sequences.
Another night, there were cut-ins of Ronnie Lott riding a motorcycle in a B movie.


Senate Candidates Trade Bitter Exchanges Over Immigration
The California Senate race, the most expensive Congressional race ever and one of the most vituperative, ground through its last full day of campaigning today, with the outcome of Tuesday's voting but a guess.

Leo Lerman Remembered for Buoyant Style, Wit and Elegance
Leo Lerman, the writer and editor who worked for Conde Nast magazines for more than 50 years, was remembered at a memorial service yesterday for forming friendships with famous actresses and opera stars, for nurturing generations of young editors and, above all, for a buoyant personal style typified by his final act.
After his death from pulmonary failure at the age of 80 on Aug. 22, his body was returned home to the Osborne Apartment House on West 57th Street, where, as he had instructed, he lay in his bed for two days dressed in lavender socks, a night shirt and one of his trademark Turkish skull caps.
A stream of friends visited him, surrounded by his precious collections of antique pill boxes, Tiffany lamps and pictures of erupting volcanoes.


By Design; Spring Forecast: Snaky
There's no doubt about it.
The accessories to have for spring 1995 are high-heeled ankle-strap sandals and skinny belts.
After appearing in every European show last month, they turned up again in last week's Seventh Avenue collections.
Patent leather is the choice of most designers, chiefly in black, white or red, but the real news is the return of snakeskin.
Gray-and-white snakeskin is the perfect complement to all the spring pastels, and the natural texture and pattern of the reptile contrast well with the plain fabrics and monotone colors of the clothes.
There were also some flesh-toned sandals at Calvin Klein, which may be prophetic, considering the popularity of bare legs and sheer hosiery.

The number of incidents of murder, robbery and assault has declined in almost all the nation's largest cities, most markedly in the West, according to a survey by the New York City Police Department.
Twenty of the 22 police departments that were surveyed said there were fewer felonies in the first six months of this year than there were in the same period last year.
The cities showing the greatest declines in felonies were San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, El Paso and San Antonio, in descending order.
San Francisco reported a 25.2 percent decrease in total felonies, with better than 20 percent decreases each in murder, rape, robbery, burglary, larceny theft and motor vehicle theft.

Foreman Makes HBO a Winner, Too
Riddick Bowe was HBO's heavyweight champion.

All lost.
Michael Moorer beat Holyfield -- then disappeared as if he were too shy or too busy watching reruns of "Top Cops."
When Oliver McCall upset Lewis in September, he gleefully shouted, "I'm a Showtime fighter!" Put together, the scenario promised HBO little in heavyweight land.
Then along came George Foreman Saturday, in the grandest battle of bald men since the 1956 Eisenhower-Stevenson bout, leveling Moorer in the 10th.
Then he thanked Seth Abraham, the president of HBO Sports.


Dow Up 1.35 as Market Awaits the Election
The stock market was mixed ahead of today's midterm Congressional elections, in which Democratic incumbents were expected to fare worse than their Republican counterparts, further hobbling the Clinton Administration.
If the Republicans win decisively in the House and Senate, some traders are sure to bid up stocks on the theory that future Clinton initiatives interpreted as bad for business will also be decisively defeated.
But some of the major unpopular-with-the-market initiatives, like health care reform, are already all but dead, so the market reaction may be muted.


Listening to Schumann's Mental Changes
Romanticism was in its way a form of insanity.
It played the violent Ping-Pong game of polarities, bouncing from the eloquence of melancholy to the boundless energies of the ecstatic.
With its gray vocabulary and tools of measurement, psychiatry reduces these exalted states to "depression" and "mania," and in the process has squeezed a lot of romance out of our lives.
Science, indeed, has a hard time dealing with the human spirit.
Do the 1960's, for example, represent a grand social upheaval or simply a documentable nervous breakdown?
Was the age of Berlioz and Wagner artistic liberation or a plunge into the mood swings of the manic-depressive condition?

Once a week, Gilbert Jackson, a recovering heroin addict who has tuberculosis and AIDS, picks up medication at St.
Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan and happily submits to poking and prodding as part of a Federal study of new AIDS therapies.
The study in which Mr.
Jackson is enrolled began in 1989, part of an effort to insure that minorities, women and people who inject drugs were included in AIDS research trials.


Chess
Can a strategy that was long ago outmoded as primitive and crude flourish in today's sophisticated tournament play?
Don't reject the idea without taking a look at the current adventures of that ancient opening, the Center Game.
Its strategy is to bring out the queen, the most powerful piece, right at the start.
Beginners do this because it is easier to move the queen around the board than it is to coordinate the moves of bishops, knights and rooks.
The drawback of early deployment of the queen is, however, that it becomes vulnerable to the jabs of the enemy's lesser pieces and pawns.
Thus, time is lost guarding the queen from mishaps and the brave beginning often degenerates into cringing.

New Ability to Find Earliest Cancers: A Mixed Blessing?
AS scientists develop ingenious techniques to detect smaller and smaller cancers, some investigators are voicing a note of caution.
Finding a cancer early may not be better, they say, unless it is one that will progress if left untreated.
It sounds heretical but, these critics say, studies show that many, if not most, early cancers do not grow large and dangerous and would never be noticed unless doctors with an early detection method went looking for them.
Yet tiny cancers are so common that autopsy studies of middle-aged and older people have found that almost everyone's body contains them.
If the cancers are harmless, treatment could be useless or possibly even harmful because it might subject people to needless surgery or chemoterapy.
The skeptics add that even with cancers that do become life-threatening, early detection and treatment do not always help.


Brotherhood of Anger -- A special report.; Palestinian Religious Militants: Why Their Ranks Are Growing
On the second day of Nidal Tamimi's funeral at the end of October, mourners arrived by the hundreds.
They climbed a hill to where his parents, relatives and friends accepted condolences over the death of the 22-year-old Hamas member, shot at a checkpoint in Hebron by Israeli soldiers.
But this was not merely a gathering of angry militants capitalizing on the death of one of their own.
The mourners came from every walk of life, young and middle-aged, representing virtually every family of Hebron as they patiently wended their way to the funeral site above the city.

Can You Deal With a Friend's Death Too Well?
An intensely personal book about Gilda Radner has turned into one of the hottest properties in town.
But its author, Alan Zweibel, isn't quite sure he's happy with all the attention.
The book, "Bunny Bunny," subtitled "Gilda Radner: A Sort of Love Story," consists almost entirely of dialogue between Radner and Mr.
Zweibel, and it has had a half-dozen readings, including two today at the Walter Kerr Theater in New York.
Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays Radner, the comedian who died of ovarian cancer in 1989, and Jason Alexander is Mr.
Zweibel, a writer for television and film.
Both have done the reading before, but other well-known actors have also played Radner, who was in the original cast of "Saturday Night Live," and Mr.
Zweibel, one of the show's first writers.


South Korea to Lift Curbs On Business Ties to North
South Korea said today that it would begin lifting restrictions on business dealings with North Korea, clearing the way for economic cooperation between the two countries still divided by the legacy of the cold war.
In short North Korea, one of the world's most isolated nations and a last bastion of Stalinism, looks open for business.


A Reassignment For Coca-Cola
The Coca-Cola Company has confirmed the reassignment of one brand account but would not discuss the possible reassignment of a second.
Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, yesterday confirmed a report this week in Adweek that the Martin Agency in Richmond, which handles the Mello Yello brand, had also been awarded the Mr.
Pibb brand without a review.
Billings were not disclosed.
Mr.
Pibb was at GSD&amp; M Advertising in Austin, Tex., until that agency resigned its Coca-Cola assignments last year to become the Royal Crown Cola Company agency.


6 Candidates Thrash Out The Issues on TV (Sort Of)
With two television sets and the attention span of a channel surfer, it was possible to imagine that there was a debate between the candidates for governor of New York last night.
Unquestionably, on the night before the election, all six candidates were on TV at the same time, for the first time.
That they happened to be on different channels was something of an impediment to meaningful dialogue, but by using a fistful of remote controls to selectively raise and lower the volume, one could pretend that they were talking to one another.


Big, Bad Cowboys Knock Giants Into Next Season
When the Dallas Cowboys were ahead by 14-3 in the second quarter, ABC-TV's cameras panned to the team owner Jerry Jones in his box in Texas Stadium.
He was smiling and laughing as if the game had already been won.
When those same cameras showed the Giants' braintrust of the Mara family and General Manager George Young, they caught a group of men who looked as if they were at a funeral.
In a way they were.
The Giants' season is dead.
As one player said, it looks like he is going to be home for Christmas.
As Giants Coach Dan Reeves said, it's time to look to next year.
The Giants were overmatched, overwhelmed, and beaten down in a 38-10 hammering before a sellout crowd of 64,836 here and a national television audience that witnessed the Giants' sixth straight defeat.

I.B.M.-Apple PC Deal Meets With Skepticism
Apple Computer Inc. and I.B.M. formally announced today their plan to build a personal computer that will run either company's software.

"They actually need the same software on every machine," said Phil Lemmons, editor in chief of PC World magazine, a trade publication.

Alongside favorites like "If Music Be the Food of Love," "Sweeter Than Roses," "Oh! Lead Me to Some Peaceful Gloom" and the lustrous "Evening Hymn," Ms.
Toth explored some lesser-known duets: "The Dialogue Between Thirsis and Daphne," the mischievous "I Spy Celia" and the plaintive "For Love Ev'ry Creature," with its characteristic Purcellian ground bass.

Hubble Maps Face Of a Moon Of Saturn
Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have mapped the previously unseen face of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and discovered a surface feature that is the size of Australia.
The researchers said today that they had used special filters aboard the Hubble to detect infrared light radiated by Titan and to produce 50 images of the smog-shrouded moon that reveal some surface detail.
The atmosphere of methane gas and suspended hydrocarbon particles scatters visible light and makes Titan appear to be a fuzzy orange ball under normal observation.

Treasuries Are Flat in Quiet Day
Prices of government securities were flat in quiet trading yesterday.
After large losses last week, the market took a breather yesterday in one of the quietest sessions of the year.
Investors were jolted on Friday by the October employment report, seeing hints of inflation in the data on wages and the workweek.
Yesterday, a decline in commodity markets helped to calm some of the inflation jitters.
The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities fell 1.15 points, to 233.01.


Of Time, Loss and Death: The Vista Is Lengthening
THE AFTERLIFE And Other Stories By John Updike  316 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.
Variations on the theme of middle age, the stories in John Updike's new collection, "The Afterlife," are accompaniment pieces to his last Rabbit novel, the melancholy "Rabbit at Rest" (1990).
Like that novel, these tales are elegies for lost youth and receding passions; like that novel, they are written in a minor but melodic key.
The themes in this volume are also familiar ones that Mr.
Updike has dealt with throughout his 35-year career: the pleasures and disillusionments of marriage, the lure of adultery, the continuing conflict between man's vague spiritual yearnings and importunate fleshy desires, between his need for safety and his longing for freedom.

Former Councilman Sentenced in Fraud
A former New York City Councilman was sentenced yesterday to two to six years in prison for padding his payroll with ghost employees and cashing the paychecks for himself.
Prosecutors charged that the former Councilman, Rafael Castaneira-Colon, 58, illegally netted $390,000 over seven years.
Beginning in 1986, he routinely filed false time sheets for three employees who did not exist, according to the office of the Bronx District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson.

Appeal of 'Direct-to-Video' Grows Among Film Studios
Alongside advertisements for "Interview with the Vampire" in newspaper movie sections this week are those for "Texas." But don't look for any theater listings in the promotions; this film is available only on video.
"Texas," based on the James A. Michener novel, has never played in theaters or on television.
And unlike low-budget kung-fu, horror and sex thrillers -- so-called grade B titles -- which typically cost less than $500,000 to make, "Texas" cost $12 million and signals a sea change in movie-making economics, raising the stature of video stores as showcases for programming.

F.A.A. Urged to Act on Commuter Plane
The National Transportation Safety Board said tonight that the Federal Aviation Administration "should take immediate action" to prevent another crash of the type of commercial aircraft that plummeted into an Indiana cornfield last week, killing 68 people.

Youth, 14, Draws 9 Years to Life in Killing of 4-Year-Old
Eric Smith, the baby-faced teen-ager convicted in the fatal bludgeoning of a 4-year-old boy in western New York, in 1993, was sentenced yesterday to a maximum prison term of 9 years to life.
"We got what we came for," said Dale Robie after sentence was passed on the 14-year-old, who was convicted of killing Mr.
Robie's son, Derrick, on Aug. 2, 1993 in Savona, about 11 miles northwest of Corning.


Designing For Women's Various Lives
The woman envisioned by European designers lives in an idealized world where she spends her days relaxing and her evenings at glamorous parties.
At least that's the message that came through in last month's spring shows in Paris and Milan, Italy.
But in last week's Seventh on Sixth shows in New York, several different women materialized.
American designers see women who work, women who go to social lunches, women who go to elegant dinners and women who dance the night away in sleazy clubs.
And they provided clothes for these various lives: suits, dresses with jackets, sweater sets, satin jeans, slip skirts, slinky bias-cut evening dresses, see-through chiffons and bouffant-skirted ingenue dresses.

Baseball Talks Go North
In an effort to move the stagnant baseball talks, the mediator has moved them from Washington to Westchester.
Bill Usery Jr. initially scheduled the resumption of talks for Washington, but the owners and the striking players preferred New York.
They compromised on Westchester County, arranging for four days of meetings at Arrowwood, a resort and conference center in Rye Brook.
The talks, the first effort at negotiating in two months, will resume Thursday.
Usery and the negotiators have agreed to remain at Arrowwood and meet daily through Sunday.
The schedule could be undermined if the two sides discover after the first couple of days that they have nothing constructive to discuss.


Theory on Human Brain Hints How Its Unique Traits Arose
THE answer to one of the thorniest questions in evolution -- how did Homo sapiens develop language, musical ability and other uniquely human traits? -- may at last be at hand.
The key may lie in an ancient brain structure thought to coordinate body movements, according to a brash theory on brain evolution that has gained backing from new research.
The theory holds that modern humans evolved when areas of the cerebellum, the part of the brain just above the brain stem that controls movement, and frontal parts of the higher cortex both expanded.
At the time, rudimentary connections between them also expanded, forming a unique circuit.
This expanded circuit, which is not found in other primates or vertebrates, may have resulted from a mutation in one or more genes that help shape the developing brain, said Dr.
Henrietta Leiner, who developed the theory a decade ago with her husband, Dr.
Alan Leiner.
The part of the brain that gives humans motor dexterity enlarged to give them mental dexterity, she said.


More Than Decoration, Songbirds Are Essential to Forests' Health
THE migrating songbirds that brighten North America's forests each spring with dazzling colors and melodious strains have been regarded by many scientists as mere decorative frills that play a limited role, if any, in the functioning of their ecosystems.
But a new study provides what researchers say is the first evidence that these birds, some of which are in decline, play a crucial role in maintaining the health and productivity of forest trees.
In the study, in the current issue of the journal Ecology, two researchers have shown that these voracious predators can protect trees by eating the bugs that chew the leaves.
As a result, scientists are predicting that the decline of these birds could eventually threaten the productivity of forests in the United States as well as in the birds' wintering grounds in the tropical forests of Central and South America.

But many Africa experts and Zairians say the Administration's tentative embrace of Prime Minister Leon Kengo wa Dondo will do the opposite of what it intends: rehabilitate Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's dictator, whom the Administration has shunned in recent years because of his human-rights abuses and large-scale corruption.

Question Haunts a Candidate: 'Didn't You Just Run?'
As he campaigned throughout the various neighborhoods on Staten Island's south shore, Vito J. Fossella Jr., a City Councilman up for re-election today, was frequently asked about burning issues like overcrowded schools.
But he was also haunted by one unrelenting question from voters: "Didn't you just run for office a few months ago?"
Indeed, Mr.

But under a provision in New York's four-year-old City Charter, Mr.
Fossella had to run again in this election.

The agencies eliminated, which handled American accounts only, were Publicis/Bloom in New York, with brands like Baby Fresh wipe products and Cottonelle bathroom tissue, and Weightman Advertising in Philadelphia, with brands like Scott bathroom tissue.
Conill Advertising in New York continues to handle campaigns aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers.

Restraints for Elderly
In a pioneering program begun several years ago, the Jewish Home and Hospital for Aged in Manhattan and the Bronx showed that it was rarely necessary to restrain nursing home patients who suffered from mental confusion or extreme physical weakness.
Use of restraints is commonplace in nursing homes and at one time homes were cited for neglect when frail or agitated patients were not restrained.
Believing this practice to be inhumane and psychologically damaging to residents, the Jewish Home made a concerted effort to reduce it, first by extensive talks to change attitudes and erase fears among the staff, residents and families and then by working to increase the strength and mobility and improve the gait and balance of residents through exercise and physical rehabilitation.

"We should all be ashamed. It's a great crime. I hope to God they stay in the room until something is done."

A Newspaper Labor Dispute Spawns an On-Line Rivalry
The strike blocking deliveries of both of San Francisco's major daily newspapers has provided an unexpected but revealing test of electronic publishing.
The strike, which entered its second week yesterday against The San Francisco Chronicle and The San Francisco Examiner, has deprived more than 600,000 newspaper readers of election accounts, sports scores, comics and columnists.


Spielvogel Will Run United Auto Group
Carl Spielvogel, the longtime advertising executive, yesterday was named chairman and chief executive of United Auto Group Inc., a fast-growing private operator of multiple-franchise auto dealerships.
The move comes less than three weeks after Mr.
Spielvogel startled Madison Avenue by announcing his resignation as chairman of Bates Worldwide Inc., one of the largest advertising agency companies.


West
ALASKA
A Democrat, Tony Knowles, went into Election Day with a big lead in the polls in his bid for re-election as Governor despite an acerbic campaign run by his Republican opponent, Jim Campbell, a retired Anchorage businessman.
One advertisement, which the Campbell campaign ran briefly in October, created a flurry of concern among Mr.
Knowles's supporters, who complained that it wrongly accused him of womanizing.


Making Peace With Death, Going On With Life
The dance floor was once a symbol of pleasure and possibilities: a place to flaunt physicality and meet new partners.
The AIDS epidemic has changed that, lending every new encounter an element of danger, bringing a sense of loss to clubs that once were carefree.
Seal, the English singer and songwriter who started a two-night engagement at the Beacon Theater on Monday, captures that new mood of somber revelry, a mixture of hope and mourning.
His songs struggle to make peace with mortality, yearning for "life without the pain" and insisting that for the living, "It's time to move on."
Seal, who this year released his second album, "Seal" (ZTT/Sire/ Warner Brothers), is on his first American tour, and his concert preserved the mystique of his video clips.
Onstage, he was shrouded in smoke and darkness; he wore black until, near the end of his 90-minute set, he stripped down to a white sleeveless T-shirt, ignoring the squeals of the many young women in the audience.
Seal's voice was husky and melancholy, restraining itself and staying low, revealing a soul singer's tenor range only near the end of the concert.
Even when his band played dance rhythms, he moved in slow motion, striking sculptural poses with his tall, lean frame.


G.O.P. Takes 2 Senate Seats, and More
The Republicans swept both of Tennessee's seats in the United States Senate today and, for good measure, took the governor's office from the Democrats and seized a majority in the state's delegation to the House of Representatives.
The most dramatic result of Election Day here was the victory by a political newcomer, Dr.
William Frist, a surgeon who until eight years ago had not even registered to vote, over a three-term Democratic incumbent, Senator Jim Sasser, who had hoped to become Senate majority leader in the next Congress.


Medieval Marketing: A Rare-Book Copy For a Mere $16,425
Act now while the supply lasts, and you can buy a rare facsimile of an 11th-century, illuminated German manuscript for only $16,425.
After March 15, the price will rise to $19,205.
This is what S. Fischer Verlag of Frankfurt, the publisher, has told prospective German buyers interested in acquiring a 410-page, gilded copy of a pericope, a collection of richly illustrated Latin scriptural passages commissioned by Emperor Henry II of Germany in 1012 and now the property of the Bavarian State Library in Munich.


Governor, Philosophical, Concedes and Soldiers On
He never prayed for victory on his final Election Day, the most sorrowful day in a career that had known few such moments of defeat.
Instead, said Mario M. Cuomo, he fashioned a different prayer.
"The prayer we say is not, 'Lord, let me win,' " he said, "but the prayer we say is 'Lord, let me understand the outcome and deal with it.' "


South
ALABAMA
Trying to act as a counterweight to the anti-Clinton sentiment in Alabama, Gov.
James E. Folsom Jr. was neck and neck with his Republican opponent, Fob James Jr.
Mr.
Folsom, 45, a former lieutenant governor, became governor last year after Gov.
Guy Hunt, a Republican, was convicted of ethics violations.
Mr.
James, 60, governed the state from 1979 to 1983 as a Democrat, but switched parties for this race.
In a hotly contested House battle in the northern Fifth District, Wayne Parker, a Republican banker, was in the midst of a tight race with a two-term Democratic incumbent, Robert E. Cramer.
Mr.
Parker counted on powerful party ties to help him.

He was 85 and lived in Linden, N.J., most of his life.
He suffered a long illness, according to the Jesuit community in Jersey City.

High Court Considers Limits of Congress's Power
Congress was on the defensive in arguments before the Supreme Court today as the Justices expressed doubt about the constitutionality of two recent Federal laws.
One prohibits Federal civil servants from accepting pay for single speeches or articles, whether or not connected to their work.
The other bans the possession of guns within 1,000 feet of a school.
Federal appeals courts declared both laws unconstitutional last year.
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that the ban on honorariums, part of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, violated Federal employees' First Amendment right of free speech.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, ruled that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 was a Federal intrusion on state sovereignty for which Congress had failed to provide an adequate rationale.


Corrections
A picture caption on Nov. 2 about a drive to help schools take advantage of a Federal program that provides breakfast for needy children misidentified the school in lower Manhattan where the picture, which showed the actress Rosie O'Donnell playing with children, was taken.

Republican Gains and Obligations
"I need help, folks," said President Clinton during his final, desperate burst of campaigning.
He did not get it.
The result was a historic shift of power to the Republicans, in Washington and in statehouses throughout the nation.
The consequences of the weak Democratic showing were particularly painful in New York State.
It lost a Governor of great stature, Mario Cuomo, in favor of an untested newcomer, George Pataki.
Mr.
Pataki's promise of a sweeping tax cut poses a clear threat to New York City.
Its Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, responded heroically to this threat with his endorsement of Mr.
Cuomo.
The first test for Mr.
Pataki will be to show that he is not vindictive toward the city or the Mayor, and that he is independent of his political sponsor, Senator Alfonse D'Amato.

Lautenberg Edges Out Haytaian For 3d Term
Frank R. Lautenberg won a third term as a United States Senator from New Jersey yesterday by defeating Assembly Speaker Chuck Haytaian in a campaign that focused on abortion, gun control and taxes.
The 70-year-old Senator drew heavily on the support of a state Democratic Party that was motivated by severe defeats in recent years for the governor's office and the State Legislature.
Union members and women voted strongly for the Senator, and he benefited from big turnouts in the Democrats' traditional strongholds, Essex and Hudson counties, to overcome Mr.
Haytaian's support in the suburbs and the vigorous campaign aid of Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; In Bitter Cola War, Coke Takes a Less-Sweet Tack
For almost a year, the Coca-Cola Company has talked up the return of its familiar contoured bottles as part of efforts to differentiate its flagship soft drink from competitors.
Now Coca-Cola is talking up what's inside those bottles, too.
Coca-Cola is injecting new fizz into the cola wars by stressing Coke's less-sweet taste in a significant multimillion-dollar advertising campaign on the Univision and Telemundo Spanish-language television networks.
It's likely to be introduced sometime soon in a mainstream- market, English-language version.

After a Bitter Campaign, Voters Stick With Robb
Senator Charles S. Robb beat back a ferocious challenge yesterday by his Republican opponent, Oliver L. North, after one of the bloodiest and most closely watched campaigns in the country.
With Republicans winning elsewhere, analysts here were surprised by how quickly Mr.
Robb's victory became evident tonight.
Virginia is a conservative state, and Mr.
Robb, a Democrat, was thought to be hobbled not only by reports about his personal life but also by his association with President Clinton, whose standing here is relatively low.


Food Notes
Ordering for Thanksgiving
For some, Thanksgiving dinner is the annual occasion to cook.
For others, it's business as usual, with some or all of the dinner ordered from catering shops, bakeries and restaurants.
Anyone interested in buying prepared food for Thanksgiving should be deep into the planning.
Holiday menus have been posted at just about every catering shop and bakery and at many restaurants -- too many excellent ones, in fact, to begin recommending particular places or dishes.
Most places have set the middle or the end of next week as the deadline for accepting orders.


Control of Law-Making Now Tilts Conservative
With Republicans in control of the Senate next year, the legislative schedule and the chairmanship of the committees where laws are written will be in the hands of a group of politicians much more conservative than the Democrats who have run the Senate for the last eight years.
Bob Dole of Kansas, who is contemplating a run for the Presidency in two years, will become majority leader, a post he held in 1985 and 1986 and relinquished after Democrats took the Senate in the 1986 elections.
His deputy will be Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming.
Both are known for their tart tongues and their skill in debate.


Mason Feels Unloved As Starks Signs Pact
In a surprising development that threatens the Knicks' chemistry this season, John Starks was signed to a three-year, $13.1 million contract extension yesterday, and Anthony Mason's bid for a new deal was denied.
How Mason, who is in the final year of a $1.3 million contract, will handle this remains to be seen, but he said Monday that he felt unappreciated by the team.

2 Medical Companies To Merge
The Boston Scientific Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Scimed Life Systems Inc. in a stock swap valued at about $870 million.
With combined sales exceeding $700 million, the two medical device companies would continue the growing trend toward one-stop shopping demanded by hospitals and large managed health care buyers.


Black Investors Buy Franchises From Denny's
The Denny's restaurant chain, which for years has been accused of widespread prejudice against black customers, announced yesterday that a black-owned company in Atlanta had agreed to buy and operate as many as 47 Denny's restaurants in New York and New Jersey.
The arrangement moves Denny's close to meeting a goal the chain established with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to add 53 minority-owned restaurants by 1997.
Only a few months ago, none of the more than 1,500 Denny's restaurants were owned by blacks.
One black franchisee was added in June and a second one last week.


Metropolitan Diary
DEAR DIARY:
An Indian summer Saturday.
The No. 1 uptown subway, bulging with families and shoppers, is hot and sticky.
At 59th Street and Columbus Circle the doors open but they do not close.
Five minutes pass, 10, perhaps 15.
The doors remain open.
Everyone is becoming cranky, fidgety.
No announcement is made.
An accident?
A fire?
A schedule adjustment?
Who knows?


In Chicago (Truly!), Many Stay Home
Precinct captains stood outside nearly empty polling places.
They looked at their lists and checked off names.
They got people rides to the polls.
They got babysitters for voters' children.
They slipped reminders on front porches and palm cards in people's hands.
They got doors slammed in their faces and weak promises from voters who vowed they would vote but did not.
By the end of Election Day in a city where politics is a blood sport more important than even baseball, less than half of the voters had cast ballots for state and Congressional races that politicians said could change the face of Washington.

The favorite early season opponent for the state of Texas has come home 0-3, groggy and disheveled.

Michigan State Fires Perles as Football Coach
GEORGE PERLES, wiping away tears, was fired as Michigan State's football coach yesterday by a university president tired of losing.

The Spartans (4-5) play Purdue on Saturday and at Penn State on Nov. 26.


Ho Chi Minh City Journal; In Crumbling Embassy, Echoes of a Fateful Day
Nearly 20 years after the end of the war, there are still places in Vietnam that can make an American shudder.
The battlefields of Khe Sanh.
The village of My Lai.
The prison known as the Hanoi Hilton.
The rooftop of the United States Embassy in Saigon.
Today, the killing grounds of Khe Sanh and My Lai are grown over in places with rice paddy, verdant proof of the desire of the Vietnamese to put the war behind them, and much of the Hanoi Hilton is destined for the wrecking ball to make way for a modern office building.


Computer Glitch Stalls Federal Express
The Federal Express Corporation, which built its reputation by promising timely delivery of packages, stumbled on its pledge yesterday when a computer glitch interrupted pickup services for some of its customers.
For most of the day, the glitch forced the company, the world's largest express mail service, to suspend "on-call pickups" -- those from occasional business and residential customers, who call for a Federal Express courier to pick up letters and packages.


Off the Menu
Movable Feasts
Daniel Boulud, the chef and co-owner of Restaurant Daniel at 20 East 76th Street, has joined with Jean-Christophe Le Picart to form a catering company called Feast and Fetes.
Mr.
Le Picart had been a partner in a catering company in New York called Tentation, which is no longer in business.
The new company, which will cater small dinner parties and larger events, is now based in the Hotel Surry, where Restaurant Daniel is situated, but is looking for larger quarters.
Information: (212) 737-2224.
Downtown Dining
When the Vista Hotel reopened last week, nearly two years after it was severely damaged in the bombing of the World Trade Center, two of its restaurants also reopened.
The Greenhouse Cafe is serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the Tall Ships Bar and Grill serves lunch and dinner from a hearty American menu.
The hotel is replacing its American Harvest restaurant with three private dining rooms called the Harvest Rooms.
The rooms are to open in January with the 16,000 or so bottles of wine from Windows on the World, which used to be run by Hilton International, the owner of the Vista.
When Windows reopens, it will be run by the Joseph Baum &amp; Michael Whiteman Company.
The Stanhope Reopens
This is preview week at the Restaurant in the Stanhope Hotel, East 81st Street and Fifth Avenue.
Scott Cohen, the new executive chef, is putting the finishing touches on his American menu prior to the restaurant's official reopening on Saturday evening.
The dining room, now on two levels, with a view of Fifth Avenue, has a less formal look and serves lunch and dinner, with dinner entrees from $17.50 to $25.
That's Italian!
This evening, Tony May's Hostaria and Gastronomia will open in Port Chester, N.Y., at 25 South Regent Street.
Mr.
May, who owns San Domenico in Manhattan, has every Italian dining trend covered in his new restaurant and catering shop, including a vast antipasto display, designer pizzas, family-style platters and old-fashioned comfort food like spaghetti and meatballs.
There is even a bank of television sets tuned to news and sports over the bar.
For those whose idea of a spectator sport is watching chefs flinging pizza dough in the air, video cameras will also bring that activity to the screen.
A Tavern or Two or Three
Tavern (of one sort or another) is definitely the hot restaurant name.
Mrs.
Park's Tavern, a lower-priced spinoff of New York's Park Avenue Cafe, has just opened in the Doubletree Guest Quarters, in Chicago just off Michigan Avenue.
In January, a Chicago clone of Park Avenue Cafe is also to open in the adjacent space.
Alan Stillman, the president of the New York Restaurant Group, which owns the restaurants, said that there were plans to open Park Avenue Cafes in Philadelphia and Boston.
White Truffles for Dinner
On Nov. 29 at 7 P.M., Ristorante Barolo, 398 West Broadway (near Prince Street), is holding a five-course white truffle dinner paired with wines from the Piedmont region of Italy.
The cost of the dinner is $100 a person.
Reservations: (212) 226-2055.
Sweet Truffles for Dessert
Speaking of truffles, the chocolate variety is much in evidence this fall.
A menu of chocolate desserts and drinks, including truffles to nibble, is served on Friday and Saturday evenings from 6 to midnight in the Lobby Lounge at the Four Seasons Hotel, 57 East 57th Street.
At Mark's Restaurant in the Mark Hotel, East 77th Street and Madison Avenue, a teatime all-you-can-eat chocolate menu is served every afternoon from 3 to 5:30.
And Tavern on the Green, at West 67th Street and Central Park West, now serves desserts that have been featured in Chocolatier magazine.

Albany's Kingmaker Now Sets Sights on Giuliani
Even before the voters' verdict was in and his success sealed in New York's shadow slugfest of political surrogates, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato was viewing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as a driven enemy certain to persist beyond their bruising gubernatorial conflict.
"He's a master," the Senator conceded of the Mayor yesterday morning, their feud deepening with each crossover vote instigated by the Republican Mayor's shocking endorsement of the Democratic Governor, Mario M. Cuomo, in his knife-edged defeat by George E. Pataki.

Judges Err on Whitewater
The behavior of Judge David Sentelle, which put a cloud over the appointment of a new independent prosecutor in the Whitewater case during August, was bad in itself.
But the justification for that behavior now offered up by Chief Judge Harry Edwards of the U.S.
Court of Appeals is equally appalling.
Judge Sentelle headed a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals that appointed Kenneth Starr, a former judge and U.S.
Solicitor General, as independent counsel last summer, replacing Robert Fiske.
The court, which makes the selection under the independent counsel law, decided that because Mr.
Fiske had been recommended by the Clinton Administration's Justice Department, he should be removed to avoid any possible appearance of partiality to President Clinton in the inquiry into Arkansas land dealings.

When Cold Remedies Harm the Young
FOR parents, there is no greater impulse than the desire to make their children well when they are sick.
And no illness has parents reaching for medicine more often than the common cold, a recent national survey found.
More than a third of 3-year-olds had been given an over-the-counter cough or cold drug in the month before the survey, The Journal of the American Medical Association reported earlier this fall.
The problem is that these preparations may do more harm than good.
Even those made specially for children have never been tested for safety on them, and studies show not only that these drugs do not relieve children's cold symptoms but that they can make them worse, causing side effects like drowsiness.

Upstart Lakers Control the Tempo
It was midway through the second quarter and Cedric Ceballos was still waiting.
When would the Knicks put a stop to the Lakers' wild runs up and down the court?
When would they no longer be able to go to the net with such impunity?
When would that infamous New York defense kick in?
Ceballos knew those things would happen sooner or later.
So did Nick Van Exel, his Laker teammate.
So did Del Harris, their coach.
In the meantime, the young, up-tempo Lakers were going to have a little fun.


Daniel Seacord, 73, Nuclear Physicist
Daniel Freeman Seacord, a nuclear physicist who took part in atomic tests at Los Alamos, N.M., and in the Pacific in the early 1950's, died on Saturday at Milford-Whitinsville Regional Hospital in Milford, Mass.
He was 73 and lived in Medway, Mass.
The cause was respiratory failure, his family said.


For Mail-Order Food Gifts, Sweets Top the Wish List
THIS year, this annual mail-order column has almost twice as many sweets as savories.
That is in part because there are many more mail-order desserts than there are mail-order vegetables, meat, cheese or grain dishes.
But after watching the guests at a mail-order party at my home a few months ago, it was easy to conclude that people are far more interested in sweets as gifts than they are in, say, the best buffalo-milk mozzarella or smoked fish.
They are also less discriminating about sweets than they are about any other category of food.


P.&amp;G. Official Joins Microsoft
William H. Gates turned to an expert in computers and consumer-products marketing today to fill a longstanding opening in the top management ranks of the Microsoft Corporation.
The company, based in Redmond, Wash., announced that it had appointed Robert J. Herbold, a senior vice president at the Procter &amp; Gamble Company, as its executive vice president and chief operating officer.


Northeast
CONNECTICUT
Joseph I. Lieberman, one of only a half-dozen Senate Democrats with seemingly secure seats, trounced his challenger, Gerald Labriola, a retired pediatrician and former State Senator who made little headway against the popular incumbent.
Mr.
Labriola had promised to serve only one term if he won.
With the retirement of Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the race for governor was a muddled four-way contest won by John G. Rowland, a former Republican Representative.
His opponents were William E. Curry Jr., a Democrat who is the state comptroller; Lieut.
Gov.
Eunice S. Groark of Mr.
Weicker's A Connecticut Party, and an anti-tax crusader, Tom Scott, running as the long-shot Independence Party candidate.
Mr.
Rowland overcame a late setback when it was disclosed that he had tried to suppress a police report about a marital dispute.


Midwest
ILLINOIS
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the 18-term Chicago Democrat who stepped down as the head of the Ways and Means Committee after his indictment earlier this year on corruption charges, lost to a relative unknown, Michael P. Flanagan.
Mr.
Rostenkowski had run a low-profile campaign and, sensing his vulnerability, the national Republican Party last week sent his campaign more than $50,000 for an advertising blitz.
Gov.
Jim Edgar, a Republican in his first term, trounced the state's comptroller, Dawn Clark Netsch, whose campaign never got off the ground after she staged an upset victory in the primary last spring.


Twyla Tharp to Perform
Twyla Tharp and her dancers are to perform at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in mid-January in a program called "Twyla Tharp Red, White and Blues New Works." The new dances were recently presented as works in progress at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
They are performed to 1950's doo-wop, excerpts from the soundtrack of "The Civil War" and music by Duke Ellington, Bartok, Gluck, the Drummers of Burundi and Wynton Marsalis.
The company of eight dancers is to perform at the academy's Opera House on Jan. 16 to 21 and 23 to 28.
Tickets are $15, $20 and $25.
Ticketmaster: (212) 307-4100.
Information: (718) 636-4129.


As G.O.P. Gains, Clinton Mood Dampens
President Clinton did not stop campaigning until midafternoon today.
But even as he urged radio listeners around the country to get out and vote, there was an air of resignation in his voice, and at the White House tonight the mood edged toward despair.
As it became clear that Republicans were making substantial gains in the Senate, Mr.
Clinton kept a public silence.
Aides said the President had retreated to his private quarters in the White House to monitor the returns with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and a few advisers, and was making telephone calls to winners and losers in his party.
He is scheduled to hold a news conference on Wednesday afternoon at which he is expected to say he recognizes voters' desire for change.


Girl Reports Rape In School Bathroom
A 14-year-old girl reported that she was raped on Monday in a bathroom of George Washington High School in upper Manhattan, the police said yesterday.
The girl told the police her attacker was wearing a ski mask and was hiding inside a stall of a bathroom of the school when she entered at 10 A.M. on Monday, a police spokeswoman, Officer Bernadette Rainy, said.
The police did not know whether the attacker was a student at the school.
Officer Rainey said the victim went home without telling school officials.
When her mother came home from work on Monday evening, she took the girl to Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital.


For Rangers, the Cup Wasn't a Pot of Gold
Winning the Stanley Cup did not make the Rangers profitable last season.
Documents prepared by Viacom for its sale of Madison Square Garden estimate a $7.7 million loss for the Rangers for the year ended Dec. 31, 1994.
But the figure includes revenue and profits from only the first two playoff series.

Voters Cry: Enough, Mr. Cuomo!
In the end, even his friends agreed, Mario Matthew Cuomo simply strutted and fretted too long on the great stage of his state, and yesterday, with the pungent irrevocability of the Latin he loves to quote, the voters finally ordered: "Exit."
Long before it became clear last spring that the Governor's presumed opponent would be an unknown State Senator, it was clear that his toughest opponent would be his well-known self -- his untaken Presidential campaign plane, his unachieved oratory and his unsparing presence astride an electorate weary of his renunciations.


Cuomo Loss Hands Mayor Unsure Future In Own Party
Having staked his political future on a gamble that Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo would win a fourth term, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani suffered an enormous defeat last night as the Republican he had assailed as a captive of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and a menace to the downstate region was elected as New York's next governor.
While many of Mr.
Giuliani's former Republican supporters celebrated George E. Pataki's victory at the New York Hilton, Mr.
Giuliani remained closeted with his closest advisers blocks away in the Sheraton New York Hotel suite of the Liberal Party leader, Raymond B. Harding, whose party and ballot line he might now need more than ever.


Downtown Artist Goes Uptown, but Not Her Art
Kiki Smith sits cross-legged on the living room floor in her sunny Lower East Side apartment, calmly cutting doily shapes from yards of gossamer-thin paper and talking about life.
She ignores her cat, Ginzer, curled up on a corner of the paper she is cutting, snoring.
She is also oblivious to the churning of the fax machine, the constant ringing of the telephone and the loud cooing of the doves and finches that live in cages along one windowsill.
"I'm making as much stuff as I can," said the 40-year-old Ms.
Smith, her voice high-pitched and childlike.
"Then I'm going to put everything in garbage bags, take them on the subway and see how they look in the gallery. When you get things out of the house, they always look better."


Making Bread


New Sensations Cross Path of an Old One
Talk about a coincidence.
Just when it seemed women's tennis was about to doze off because of the thin mix of talent at the top, with every other final a rehash of the tired Steffi Graf-Arantxa Sanchez Vicario rivalry, the sport was revived by the October debut of a pair of 14-year-olds, Martina Hingis and Venus Williams.


California Pregnancy Study Finds Healthier Outcomes for Refugees
SUPERIOR educations and higher family incomes do not necessarily result in healthier pregnancies and healthier babies.
A new study in San Diego County has found that immigrants and refugees from Mexico and Southeast Asia have better pregnancy results than native-born American women, despite their often extreme poverty and difficulties adjusting to a foreign culture.
The researchers attributed their findings to characteristics of American life that include unhealthy eating habits, weak social support and excessive use of alcohol and drugs.
The findings were presented last week at the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association in Washington by Dr.
Ruben G. Rumbaut, a sociologist at Michigan State University in East Lansing.


U.N. Approves Tribunal on Rwandan Atrocities
The Security Council voted today to create an international tribunal to try people accused of atrocities in Rwanda even though the Rwandan delegate voted against the measure, complaining that it lacked a death penalty and only covered crimes committed in 1994.
The vote was 13 to 1 with China abstaining.
The resolution skirted the death penalty issue because over 70 countries prohibit capital punishment and any resolution that included it would have met opposition.


Songs From Vienna
The New York Festival of Song is to present a program called "Vienna: Turn of the Centuries," on Saturday at 8 P.M. at the 92d Street Y, at Lexington Avenue.
Cheryl Parrish (soprano), Susanne Mentzer (mezzo-soprano) and William Sharp (baritone), accompanied by Steven Blier and Michael Barrett, are to sing works from the years just before and after 1900, with a few samples of Haydn and Beethoven from the turn of the preceding century.
Works by Mahler, Richard Strauss, Schoenberg, Berg, Wolf, Pfitzner and Zemlinsky are on the program.
Tickets are $20.
Information: (212) 916-1100.


Rogers Signs for 9 Years
CARLOS ROGERS, a 6-foot-11-inch forward-center, signed a nine-year contract with the Golden State Warriors yesterday, leaving only one first-round National Basketball Association draft pick unsigned.
Financial terms were not available, but the agreement provides Rogers with an option to become a restricted free agent after his third season.
The 23-year-old Rogers, from Tennessee State, practiced with the team yesterday and was expected to be in uniform when the Warriors played Miami in their home opener last night.
The Warriors acquired the rights to Rogers from Seattle along with RICKY PIERCE and two 1995 second-round draft picks.
The Warriors gave up SARUNAS MARCIULIONIS and BYRON HOUSTON.


Promise to Repeal Income Tax Helps Rowland and G.O.P. to Apparent Victory
John G. Rowland, a Republican who has vowed to repeal the state's three-year-old income tax, was elected governor of Connecticut yesterday with little more than a third of the vote, defeating William E. Curry Jr., a Democrat, and two other major candidates.
Mr.
Rowland's narrow victory puts a Republican in the state's top office for the first time in two decades.
And it means that an income tax introduced in 1991 -- the major legacy of Gov.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. -- may once again be the focus of debate in the State Legislature.


At Salomon, Trader Earns $30 Million
Even though Salomon Brothers is losing more money than any other large securities firm, one of its traders is perhaps the highest paid on Wall Street.
Robert M. Stavis, a vice president in the company's New York-based bond arbitrage group, will be paid $30 million this year, according to Investment Dealer's Digest, a securities industry trade publication.


Manager's Dream Is Lost In the Sun
Mike Easler came to Puerto Rico a couple of weeks ago to nurture his managerial aspirations in this island's winter leagues much the way he had nurtured his playing career during 10 winters of play here.
But what had once been so kind an experience for the effervescent Easler turned pitilessly cruel a day ago.
For Easler, having managed all of four games, was fired.
The Caguas Criollos sent the part-time Baptist minister and full-time hitting coach for the Boston Red Sox back to the States with his hopes and faith in the game in tatters.


IN PERFORMANCE: CLASSICAL MUSIC
A Dual Focus In Concert of Remembrance  Cathedral of St. John the Divine
For the last five years, the Interfaith Committee of Remembrance has been recalling the Holocaust with concerts at the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine.
This year the event focused more narrowly -- on the liquidation of the Lodz ghetto in Poland in 1944 -- but also more broadly, looking beyond the Holocaust to remember the murder of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Turks in 1915.


Real Estate; A new mall in downtown Indianapolis is a monument to public-private partnerships.
PASSERS-BY could easily miss the $325 million Circle Centre mall in downtown Indianapolis.
Halfway through construction, it looks more like a turn-of-the-century streetscape than the standard mall found in suburbia.
But more than an example of harmonious urban architecture, the center, which is scheduled to open next September, is a monument to public-private partnerships, which have had mixed results in this city.


THE 1994 ELECTIONS: MAN IN THE NEWS -- John Grosvenor Rowland; Behind the Issues, a Yearning for Lost Innocence
In his victory speech on primary night two months ago, John G. Rowland talked about the good old days in his hometown of Waterbury, a time not so long ago when children had the run of not just their neighborhoods, but the entire city.
In his neighborhood, he recalled, he and his friends hopped a fence so often to cut across one family's yard that the father finally did something about it: he put a gate in the fence.
"Now," Mr.
Rowland said, "they'd probably call the police."


A Golden Boy Bumps Into Reality
"When I was in high school. . . .," Ron Powlus began, and his mind was temporarily removed from the here and now of Notre Dame's unexpectedly painful football season.
In high school, he was the quarterback of the Berwick Bulldogs, free of significant injury, a record-setting leader of a team that never endured more than three defeats in a season and was considered a national champion in a perfect senior year.
Life then might seem simpler in hindsight, particularly when he recalls the days when Abby, his golden retriever, was just about the only one who did not care where he was going to college.
But Powlus had not yet been considered worthy of the Heisman Trophy, and he had not yet been asked about his departure from college to the National Football League, and his collarbone had not yet snapped -- twice -- and the nasty electronic mail had not yet started appearing, and problems could be solved more simply.


Barry Rebounds From Disgrace to Win Again in Washington
Former Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. last night regained the office he had left in disgrace almost five years ago, but not without widespread defections of black voters to his Republican opponent, Carol Schwartz.
At 12:48 A.M., with 73 percent of the precincts reporting, the vote was:
Barry . . . 54%
Schwartz . . . 44%
The margin was enough to force Mrs.
Schwartz to concede shortly after 11 P.M. last night.


Sarajevo Is Hit by Artillery Fire in Worst Attack Since February
In the worst bombardment of the Bosnian capital since a NATO ultimatum in February, Sarajevo was hit by 10 to 15 artillery rounds late this afternoon, probably fired from Bosnian Serb positions, a United Nations spokesman said here tonight.
Four people, three of them children, were killed in the shelling and in sniper attacks, and six others were wounded.

THE 1994 ELECTIONS: NEW YORK GOVERNOR MAN IN THE NEWS: George Elmer Pataki; Soft but Forceful Steps Lead to Paradoxical Victory in the Governor's Race
State Senator George E. Pataki, who was elected New York's 55th Governor last night, is almost a millionaire, yet he comes off as homespun and unpretentious: He says "gosh" a lot and is so forgetful of his appearance that on a recent campaign trip he mismatched one suit's blue jacket with another's gray trousers, and then had to change pants in a hotel alcove.
He is a graduate of Yale College and Columbia Law School and can argue points like a Wall Street litigator, yet he cries at one of his favorite films, "Old Yeller," and carries a dollar signed for good luck by the late Lubavitcher Grand Rabbi, Menachem M. Schneerson.


Carrying Today's Ideas To 14th-Century World
Withdrawing from the medieval world to devote herself to the Virgin Mary, a young woman named Christine happily chooses to be forever walled into a tiny room adjoining the church.
As the last stone is put in place, "Anchoress" creates a chilling sense of entrapment while making the young woman's sense of relief and escape clear.
Now she won't have to marry the reeve, the belligerent overseer of the manor where Christine, her sister and their parents sleep in a single bed in their thatched cottage.
At times "Anchoress," an eccentric, beautifully photographed black-and-white film, offers an eerie immersion in a distant world.
In his first feature, the English director Chris Newby deftly carries our century's attitudes about spiritual freedom and feminism into an artfully constructed past in which such attitudes came from the Devil.
The story is based on scant historical references to the real Anchoress of Shere.
Two letters written on a church wall in the English countryside tell of Christine Carpenter, who escaped from the world only to long for it again.
The film's Christine (Natalie Morse) is like an emotional time traveler, a bridge between our attitudes and those of the 14th century.


McCall's Gets New Editor
Sally Koslow, editor of Mary Emmerling's Country, was named editor in chief of McCall's yesterday.
She replaces Kate White, who became editor in chief of Redbook last month.
Gruner &amp; Jahr USA Publishing, which acquired Mary Emmerling's Country and McCall's as part of a group purchase from The New York Times Company earlier this year, announced yesterday that it would close Mary Emmerling's Country after its December issue, saying the magazine had fallen short of sales goals.

G.O.P. Wins County Job
A Republican was elected Essex County Executive tonight after the Democrats were unable to recover from a divisive primary that left them with little time and money to battle for a powerful post that had traditionally been theirs.
The Republican, James Treffinger, the Mayor of Verona and the lone Republican on the County Board of Freeholders, rolled up a solid margin of victory -- in a historically Democratic county -- over Cardell Cooper, the Mayor of East Orange.


Architecture Historian Linked Us to Lost Era
To the Editor:
Re your obituary of Richard Krautheimer, the architectural historian (Nov. 3): He was a link to the now very remote world of Europe before World War I. The education of that time and place gave him a humanistic erudition almost unimaginable today.
For him, as for so many, the ferment of Weimar gave way to expulsion and the death of many family members in the Holocaust.


Saks Cleared Of Customers As Fire Erupts In Basement
A fire that firefighters described as suspicious broke out in the basement of Saks Fifth Avenue yesterday afternoon, filling the building with smoke and forcing the evacuation of the 70-year-old department store.
The fire apparently began in two large trash bins in the basement of the store, on Fifth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets.
"Mostly it stayed in the Dumpsters, so what damage there is is smoke damage," said Firefighter Jack Thompson, a Fire Department spokesman.


Editors' Note
An article on Sept. 20 about new Federal requirements for drug and alcohol tests for transit workers included a statement, attributed to a New Jersey Transit official, suggesting that new alcohol tests will probably turn up a substantial number of people working under the influence, especially in rail operations.
In letters dated Sept. 20 and Oct. 18, officials of New Jersey Transit say that the remarks of Elizabeth Schneider, their director of medical services, were misinterpreted.
They say she was talking about potential problems in the rail industry in general, not about New Jersey Transit, and that she did not characterize the numbers as substantial in any case.

Guatemala: Change the Message
For 40 years Guatemala has endured a civil war that, like many Central American conflicts, has been part cold-war proxy battle, part genuine social revolution, marked by disappearances, extrajudicial killings, torture, secret prisons and impunity for hideous human rights abuses.
As in other such conflicts, the United States' intelligence services have played a highly questionable role.
No one knows how many innocent Guatemalans have been killed in this bloody conflict.
But now U.S. attention is focused on one of its victims, a guerrilla who married an articulate American lawyer.
Jennifer Harbury is determined to force the Guatemalan military to produce her husband, dead or alive.


French Police Arrest 95 Suspected of Links to Algerian Militants
In the largest crackdown to date on Islamic militants active within France's Muslim population, the French police today arrested 95 people reportedly linked to Algeria's Armed Islamic Group in raids on homes and Muslim associations in and around Paris.
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua said the police operation confirmed the "implantation" in France of a clandestine network of Muslim militants who were determined to carry out terrorist activities from Europe.


Defying Anti-Incumbent Mood, Moynihan Wins Easily
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a three-term incumbent who is among the most influential members of Congress, was re-elected by a wide margin yesterday over his Republican challenger, Bernadette Castro, according to unofficial returns early this morning.
Mr.
Moynihan, a Democrat, defeated Ms.
Castro, a longtime Republican fund-raiser who was running for public office for the first time, by a ratio of about 3 to 2.
Henry F. Hewes, the Right to Life candidate, was a distant third.


IN PERFORMANCE: CLASSICAL MUSIC
Fostering Intimacy In Folk and Art Songs  Kaye Playhouse
Perhaps the most appealing aspect of Jorma Hynninen's art song recital on Monday evening was a sense of intimacy that made his interpretations seem like confidences between friends.
Perhaps the Kaye Playhouse deserves some of the credit: its design puts listeners close enough to the stage to catch even the subtlest turns of phrase.
But of course, if the singer does not provide those subtleties, the hall is irrelevant.


RESULTS PLUS
TENNIS  Sluggish Sampras Wins  Playing on antibiotics, Pete Sampras awoke from a slumber when pride was on the line and beat the local favorite, Johan Van Herck, to advance yesterday in the European Community Championship in Antwerp, Belgium.
The top-seeded Sampras allowed the 157th-ranked player to take him to a first-set tie breaker, but then Van Herck could not handle the pressure play of Sampras.
After winning the tie breaker, 7-2, the sluggish defending champion did just enough to take the second set at 6-4.
"I've had my better days," said Sampras, the world's top-ranked player, who is suffering from a throat infection.
"I feel depleted and I haven't eaten too much." Tomorrow, he will face Richey Reneberg, who defeated David Wheaton, 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (7-9), 6-1.
Jaime Yzaga of Peru, seeded eighth, beat the German qualifier Arne Thoms, 6-2, 7-6 (7-1), ending a string of upsets that had sent two seeded players home on the first day.
The tournament lost two top 20 players Monday when Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, seeded fourth, and Jason Stoltenberg of Australia, No. 5, lost in straight sets. (AP)


Economic Data Help To Lift Bonds
A successful start to a quarterly refinancing and two weaker-than-expected economic reports helped to lift bond prices yesterday for the first time in seven sessions.
Even gold prices rebounding from a 12-week low and a weaker dollar could not dampen the rally.
Investors instead focused on the Treasury's $17 billion three-year note auction.


EMC Bets on a PC Storage System
When the EMC Corporation, a leading maker of computer data-storage equipment, recently expanded its manufacturing operation, employees at the new site in Milford, Mass., discovered signs on the walls still bearing the name of the building's former owner, Prime Computer, a once-hot computer maker that is no longer in business.
At the employees' suggestion, Michael Ruettgers, the company's president and chief executive, decided to leave the Prime signs in place -- "to remind us of what could happen," Mr.
Ruettgers recalled.


Hall of Fame Nominees
KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR, whose skyhooks and dunks helped him become the N.B.A.'s leading career scorer, was among nine men and two women nominated yesterday for the Basketball Hall of Fame.

In the N.B.A., he led the Milwaukee Bucks to their only title and the Los Angeles Lakers to five.


Mets Promote Dave Howard
As part of a reorganization that represents a reduction in upper management, the Mets announced yesterday that they are promoting Dave Howard, the club's general counsel, to the position of vice president for business affairs.
In his new position, Howard will take over some of the duties formerly handled by both Jack Diller and Ed Lynch, both of whom have left the Mets for other positions.
Diller served as the head of the Mets' business operations until he left to assume the presidency of the San Antonio Spurs last summer.
Lynch, a former assistant to general manager Joe McIlvaine, was named the new general manager of the Chicago Cubs last month.


Arrest in Abduction Of Boy From His Bed
A construction worker has been charged in the kidnapping of a 6-year-old Fairfax County, Va., boy who was taken from his bedroom in the middle of the night last week, the police said.
The man, Edward Charles Wingo of Damascus, Md., was arrested by Montgomery County police after the boy was able to describe the car the kidnapper drove and the house to which he had been taken, said Officer Evelyn Cahalen of the Montgomery County police.
The child was found the next morning near a cemetery in Rockville, Md.

Yankees Get Patterson
Nine months after the Yankees acquired left-hander TERRY MULHOLLAND and a player to be named from the Philadelphia Phillies for BOBBY MUNOZ and two minor leaguers, they received right-handed reliever JEFF PATTERSON as the additional player yesterday.
Patterson, 26, who was placed on New York's 40-man roster, was 6-4 with a 4.60 earned run average and 5 saves for Class AAA Scranton-Wilkes Barre last year in 52 games.


All Dressed Up: Turkey and Stuffing Rolled Into Shape
NOVEMBER, the month of Thanksgiving, is truly "turkey month" for me.
This is when I can usually find terrific deals on fresh turkey in all forms, including whole turkey, breasts, legs and thighs, as well as turkey cutlets and ground turkey.
If there are special sales on fresh turkey in your area, buy it now, then double-wrap and freeze it for use over the next several months, when the price of turkey will double or triple at the market.
The piece de resistance on this menu is a turkey roulade, which is made of boned, stuffed and rolled turkey thighs.
This is such a substantial main course, especially when served as it is here with a hearty broccoli and rice etuvee (meaning braised), that only a simple green salad and a light fruit dessert need accompany it.


Gasoline Prices to Rise in Many Areas
New Federal clean-air rules will force drastic changes in the recipe used for gasoline in most urban areas in the next few weeks, and refiners and distributors are struggling to get supplies of the reformulated gasoline into place.
Some analysts are predicting spot shortages and sudden price surges.
"We're going to have the biggest change in gasoline chemistry ever, even bigger than what we saw when we went to unleaded gas in 1973 and 1974," said William Berman, chief environmental affairs lobbyist of the American Automobile Association.


Generation X Makes Its Mark

Vengeful Glee (and Sweetness) at Gingrich's Victory Party
At the Newt Gingrich victory party tonight at a mall outside Atlanta, the air was filled with vengeful glee.
The master of ceremonies, Sean Hannity, a conservative talk show host on local radio, made fun of Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo losing his race in New York, sneeringly pronouncing his name "Coo-mo." Mr.
Hannity joked that a Federal Express package had arrived with some Tylenol for President Clinton, because he was about to "feel the pain."


Ailing Klaus Tennstedt Puts Down His Baton
The conductor Klaus Tennstedt has announced his retirement from the concert stage because of poor health.
Mr.
Tennstedt, 68, has fought throat cancer and has had two hip replacements in recent years.
He canceled performances frequently because of his health problems.
But his probing interpretations of the 19th-century repertory -- Mahler in particular -- made his increasingly rare appearances notable events.
Officially, Mr.
Tennstedt is retiring only from public performances, and at EMI Classics, the company for which he had been recording since 1977, there is tentative talk of his continuing to make records.
Peter Alward, the company's vice president for artists and repertory at EMI Classics, said he hoped that Mr.
Tennstedt's "undimmed musical appetite might tempt him into the less tiring atmosphere of the recording studio."


Publicity Firm Expands Base
Dan Klores Associates, a Manhattan-based public relations company, said yesterday that it was forming a new division, Dan Klores Entertainment, to expand the company's activities with entertainment industry clients.

New York Voters End a Democratic Era
George Elmer Pataki, a lanky lawyer-legislator from the Hudson Valley who has promised to slash income taxes and restore the death penalty, was elected the 53d Governor of New York yesterday, ending 20 years of Democratic rule in Albany and toppling Mario M. Cuomo, a legendary figure in state and national politics.
In other New York races, H. Carl McCall became the first black New Yorker to win statewide elected office, defeating Herbert London in the race for state comptroller.
Mr.
McCall, a former State Senator, investment banker and president of the New York City Board of Education, was appointed Comptroller by the Legislature last year to fill a vacancy left by the midterm retirement of Edward V. Regan.

Texas Elects George W. While Florida Rejects Jeb
George W. Bush, the eldest son of former President George Bush, ousted Gov.
Ann W. Richards on Tuesday, heralding historic Republican gains in the nation's second-largest state.
But his younger brother Jeb, hoping for a similar coup in Florida, was turned back by the Democratic incumbent, Lawton Chiles.
The Bush victory over the Democratic Governor here, coupled with a crushing triumph by an incumbent Republican Senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison, brings about the first time in Texas history that the party has held the Governor's office and both Senate seats.
Republicans also made major gains in Congressional races.


Gov. Wilson's Comeback Ends in Re-election Victory
Pete Wilson was elected to a second term as California's governor tonight by a commanding margin over his challenger, Kathleen Brown, the State Treasurer.
But it remained unclear whether the powerful tide of support for Mr.

THE 1994 ELECTIONS: Connecticut Congressional Races -- FIFTH DISTRICT; Franks Re-elected to Third Term After a Bitter Personal Campaign
Representative Gary A. Franks, a Republican from Waterbury who was seen as vulnerable in his bid for a third term, handily won re-election tonight after a lackluster campaign that focused on personal attacks and complaints even by the candidates that they weren't talking about the issues.
Mr.
Franks, 41, gained national attention in 1990 as the first black Republican elected to the House of Representatives in 60 years.
With 66 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr.
Franks had 54 percent of the vote, to 31 percent for James H. Maloney, a Democrat and State Senator from Danbury.


Insanity Plea Expected in Boys' Drownings
With a handwritten confession tucked away in the evidence file and an angry, betrayed town clamoring for her execution, Susan Smith is expected to plead that she was insane when, as charged, she drowned her two sons in a lake and then told the people in her hometown of Union, S.C., that the boys had been abducted.
But while legal experts in South Carolina and around the nation say insanity might be Mrs.
Smith's only real defense in a state that allows the death penalty for killers of children under 11, it might be difficult to persuade a jury in her home county.
Investigators say that for nine days after a fictitious Oct. 25 abduction, she orchestrated an elaborate hoax, punctuating her lies with tears.

Officials Fear Budget Cuts Will Slow Transit Repairs
Few New Yorkers doubt their transit system has gotten better since the early 1980's, when the fiscal crisis of the previous decade turned the city's bus and subway lines into a shambles and left riders plagued by derailments, track fires and breakdowns.
Now, after $12 billion has been spent on new buses, cars and tracks, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has once again cut back the city's commitment to mass transit to cope with a new fiscal crisis.

NO shimmering laser show.

This was the modest we-ain't-done-yet mood at Madison Square Garden last night when the Knicks opened their home season with a 117-113 victory over the Lakers.
"Time flies," Pat Riley said earlier in the day, before the Knicks played the first major league sports event on the New York subway line since the baseball players went on strike on Aug. 11 and the lords of hockey self-destructed in October.

Personal Health; The real problem with children's scalp ills.
WITH school in full swing, lice and ringworm have once again gone to the heads of the class.
But while the families of affected children are most distressed by what they regard as embarrassing if not repulsive infestations, dermatologists say the real problems lie in misdiagnosis and inappropriate and sometimes hazardous treatments.
Ringworm Re-Emerges
A half-century ago, ringworm, a fungal infection that most often attacks the scalp, was a common scourge among school-aged children.
And while it lapsed into relative obscurity for decades, ringworm is now back in a more insidious form that is harder to recognize and trickier to treat.

McCall Becomes First Black Elected to Statewide Office
H.
Carl McCall, who rose from a childhood on welfare to become a state legislator, ambassador and bank vice president, won the combative race for state comptroller early this morning, making history as he became the first black candidate elected to statewide office in New York.
Mr.
McCall, 58, was appointed to the job in May 1993 and this morning beat his Republican rival, Herbert London, a professor at New York University, who ran unsuccessfully this spring for his party's nomination for governor.


Raveling Ends Hospital Stay
His clothes were baggy, his voice was hollow and his gait was low-speed.
George Raveling, 44 days after a traffic accident, left a Los Angeles hospital yesterday thankful to be alive and not incapacitated.
"I am lucky to be alive," said the 57-year-old University of Southern California basketball coach.
On the morning of Sept. 25, he was about to meet a recruit for breakfast when he was injured in a two-car collision.
Doctors said his Jeep seatbelt initially saved his life, but, days after the crash, blood formed in Raveling's heart sac, forcing him into intensive care.

The wittiest, most provocative and most suggestive talk in town now is at Theater 80 on St.

MICROSOFT'S CO-FOUNDER INVESTS IN TRILOBYTE
Paul G. Allen, the co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation, is taking a minority investment in Trilobyte Inc., a software game company in Medford, Ore.
Mr.
Allen, who is on Microsoft's board, owns the Portland Trailblazers basketball team and has a controlling interest in Ticketmaster.
Trilobyte, which was established in 1991 as a spinoff of Virgin Software and has 35 employees, introduced its first game, "The 7th Guest," in April 1993.
It plans a sequel called "The 11th Hour," for introduction next year.


Bronx Officer And a Man Seeking Help Are Both Shot
An off-duty New York City police officer and a man who went to him for help, saying someone was trying to kill him, were wounded yesterday by a gunman in the South Bronx, the police said.
The officer, Avalo Amauri, 34 years old, who was shot once in the left knee, was carrying his off-duty 9-millimeter pistol.
"It happened so fast, he didn't have a chance to fire his weapon," said Lieut.
Raymond Ferrari, a police spokesman.


U.S. Agency Is Accused of Bias in Making South Africa Grants
Several current or former officials in the Agency for International Development are engaged in a dispute over whether the agency has improperly sought to exclude non-black groups both in the United States and in South Africa when it awards grants to aid that African nation.
Paul Neifert, an A.I.D. official who was transferred out of South Africa after criticizing agency policies there, complained that just when the new Government of President Nelson Mandela was seeking to build a country free of discrimination, A.I.D. was increasingly basing its grants on the color of recipients.

As Talks Near, an Ad Stirs Unrest
Just as baseball's negotiators were headed back to the table to talk peace, a new phase of the war broke out yesterday between the owners and the striking players.
Acting contrary to the low-key manner in which the mediator, Bill Usery Jr., has asked the two sides to conduct themselves, the owners went public in a two-step process.
They placed a full-page, four-color advertisement in today's edition of USA Today -- at a cost of approximately $70,000 -- and issued a news release quoting a "White Paper" in which Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, talks about "some fine tuning" baseball needs, presumably meaning a salary cap.

Nationalist, in U.S., Nice in U.S.
Buttoned grimly into a suit for his visit to America, the Russian nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky insisted that all those nasty things people said about him just were not true.
He was not an anti-Semite, the head of the ultranationalist party that shocked American leaders by capturing the biggest share of parliamentary seats in elections last December told a somewhat incredulous audience of the World Affairs Council of Northern California Monday night.

Let's Not Rush Into World Trade Agreement
To the Editor:
In early December the House and Senate return to vote on implementing the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, which was negotiated with more than 100 other countries over a period of several years.
Sadly, press coverage has been thin and not very substantial.


Chrysler Switch to New Mini-Vans
The Chrysler Corporation expects to lose about 60,000 sales of its highly profitable mini-vans in 1995 because it will temporarily shut two assembly plants to prepare for new models, company officials said today.
Auto industry analysts on Wall Street believe Chrysler makes $5,000 to $7,500 on every mini-van it sells.
Taking the lower figure, that means the No. 3 auto maker could lose at least $300 million because of the lost production and sales.


It's Not 125th Street: A Vendor Sweep in Brooklyn
Without fanfare or uproar, a police precinct in Brooklyn has moved hundreds of street vendors away from a bustling commercial strip over the last 10 months.
And, in the process, crime has decreased, store owners are pleased and some vendors are working with the police on a plan to set them up as legitimate merchants in city-owned space nearby.
It is hard to say precisely why Operation Peddler Push in the 84th Precinct has succeeded in clearing the Fulton Mall of most of the illegal vendors without the kind of tension that accompanied last month's similar campaign on 125th Street in Harlem.
One factor may be that 300 vendors used to cram the eight-block mall near Brooklyn Borough Hall, compared with 1,000 moved from the Harlem site.

Public &amp; Private; Polls, Not Passion
A funny thing happened on the way to the midterm elections.
Abortion rights, the stepchild issue of campaigns past, became a stepping stone to elected office.
While once candidates wanted the whole subject to simply go away, in 1994 it was a linchpin of both gubernatorial and Congressional campaigns, for those who had previously soft-pedaled the incendiary issue -- and those who had once shown little or no support for legal abortion at all.
As recently as 10 years ago, recalls Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, candidates eschewed the league's endorsement or asked it to keep its support low-key.
"The change this year was very noticeable," she said.
"We had people upset that I couldn't come and campaign for them."


Voters Favor Plan to Create A Legislature
Nassau County voters tonight approved a plan to create a new Legislature to replace the county's 50-year-old Board of Supervisors, which a Federal judge found to be unconstitutional.
With 54 of 71 precincts reporting, the vote was 122,098 for a new county charter and 67,929 against.


Free Tuition for Public Service Law
To help increase the flagging number of lawyers in public service, the New York University School of Law said yesterday that it would give free tuition to students who agree to take low-paying legal jobs after graduation.
Students would have to serve in these jobs for 10 years, and the university will insure this by repaying all law school costs, as much as $40,000 a year at N.Y.U., for as long as the graduate remains in public service.
If, for example, a graduate spends six years working in a public defender's office, 60 percent of the debt would be paid by the university.


Passing From the Scene


Milton Taylor, 86, Co-Owner Of Caswell-Massey Pharmacies
Milton Taylor, who with his brother Ralph took over the venerable Caswell-Massey pharmacy on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan in 1936 and helped build it into an international purveyor of fashionable toiletries, died on Saturday at his apartment in Manhattan.
He was 86.
The cause was a heart attack, said Mr. Taylor's son Adam.

Judge in the Simpson Case Eases Restrictions on Jurors
As lawyers began the task of selecting 15 alternates for the O. J. Simpson jury, Judge Lance A. Ito today told prospects -- as well as the 12 regular jurors, already chosen -- that they could now watch some television and, with caution, read newspapers.
But even under his eased regime, only viewers of old movies, home shopping programs and wildlife chronicles are unrestricted.
Any members of the jury pool venturing into other television fare must clutch their remote controls, fingers ever on "mute," to shield themselves from information about the case.


Elusive Price Cuts Intrigue Japan
In a country where shoppers are used to paying double and triple what an American might for everything from computers to cosmetics, the emergence of widespread discounting has hit Japan like a revolution.
The Japanese press has termed this happy trend "price destruction," declaring that it shows the economy is finally opening.
American trade negotiators have been struggling for years for such an opening, but there is ample room for doubt.
Experts who look beyond the headlines and follow Japan's fundamental industries like steel, cement and petrochemicals say that the old high prices and exclusionary practices persist.
Trade agreements, deregulation and the soaring value of the yen -- which makes imported goods cheaper -- have done little to open these critical markets to outsiders, whether Japanese or foreign.


Israeli Talks On Self-Rule Speeded Up
Moving to defend Yasir Arafat against a challenge from his Islamic foes, Israel agreed today to pick up the pace of its sluggish talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization on expanding self-rule beyond the Gaza Strip and the Jericho enclave to include the entire West Bank.
The two sides said that beginning in two weeks they would negotiate several major issues at the same time, principally territory-wide elections for a self-rule council and a withdrawal of Israeli forces from West Bank cities and towns.

Concession and Victory: Words of Pataki and Cuomo
Following are excerpts from the concession speech of Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo last night, as transcribed by The New York Times.
CUOMO Which brings me to my final thank-you, and that is to the people of the State of New York, this magnificent place.
Long ago, long before our first victory in 1982, this state had already given me and my family more opportunity and reward than we had any right to expect.
Then it added three terms as Governor of the greatest state in the nation.
I don't have the words to describe the deep sense of gratitude and depth that I feel for that immense opportunity.


Rich and Poor in Cuba as Castro's Sun Sets
Fidel Castro's condition must be verdaderamente desesperado if public television can't find a good word for him.
"Last Days of the Revolution" depicts a nation in despair.
The loss of Cuba's Soviet patrons, the continuance of the United States embargo and the bunglings of its Communist masters have sent the country's economy into free fall and thousands of its people on perilous voyages to Florida.
This tour by Jose de Cordoba of The Wall Street Journal was not arranged by any Cuba-United States friendship society.
It finds little light on the sunny island, where blackouts can last 16 hours.
Severe fuel and fertilizer shortages mean empty shelves in food stores.
Medicines, too, are in short supply.
The young have little hope of good jobs, and some former Fidelistas declare their loss of faith.


THE 1994 ELECTIONS: Connecticut Congressional Races-- SECOND DISTRICT; Gejdenson's Fate Is in Doubt
The fate of Representative Sam Gejdenson, a seven-term Democrat running in a rematch against a Republican who almost beat him in 1992, was uncertain early today.
Late results compiled by The Assoicated Press showed Edward W. Munster, a Republican and a former State Senator, with a 375-vote lead over Mr.
Gejdenson out of about 150,000 votes cast with 93 percent of the votes counted.


Foreman Eyes Megamillions
George Foreman is on his way to earning megamillions in endorsements if the early response to his reclaiming the heavyweight title is a leading indication.
"We had 100 telephone inquiries by the time I came in Monday morning and we've had a lot more since," Henry Holmes, Foreman's lawyer and business adviser, said yesterday.
"I got a call from a Japanese car company at 6 this morning."
Foreman will rest for a short while before deciding which companies to endorse.
"We're not going to waste any time," Holmes said.
One deal has already been made: an autobiography with Random House.
Products available to Foreman, who is viewed as cheerful, approachable and inspirational, are almost limitless.
His Doritos deal is over, and he now endorses Meineke Discount Muffler Shops and Thompson's Water Seal.


Aristide's Cabinet Is Sworn and Pledges to Get to Work
After nearly a month of highly publicized consultations with friends and foes and a bit of old-fashioned politicking behind closed doors, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide finally has a Prime Minister, a full Cabinet and a Parliament-approved plan of action.
At a ceremony at the National Palace this morning, before guests who included Haitian politicians, foreign diplomats and Maj.
Gen.
David Meade, commander of the American troops here, Prime Minister-designate Smarck Michel and his Cabinet took their oaths of office and pledged to begin work immediately on the daunting task of rebuilding a country devastated by military dictatorship, corruption and harsh economic sanctions.


Skating and Ratings
Figure skating, which dominates the television ratings at the Winter Olympics and never more so than at the '94 Games in Lillehammer, Norway, gets much of the drama from the individual rivalries that develop.
Team competitions are rare.
But tonight, a team of skaters from the United States takes on an international squad in an event known as the Ice Wars.


Harper And Knee Listed as Doubtful
The desperation pass that the Cowboys launched on the final play of the first half against the Giants on Monday night turned out to be riskier than expected.
As a result, the Cowboys could be without one of their best players when they travel to San Francisco to play the 49ers on Sunday in an eagerly awaited rematch of their National Football League championship games the last two seasons.


Erwin E. Kelm, Cargill Chief, Is Dead at 83
Erwin E. Kelm, who led Cargill Inc. through a period of rapid growth in the 1970's that helped propel the agribusiness giant to its position as the nation's largest family-owned company, died on Sunday at his home in Minneapolis, the company said yesterday.
He was 83.
Mr. Kelm died after a long struggle with heart disease, the company said.


World Bank Approves Loan to Help Russia Clean Up Pollution
The World Bank today approved its first loan to Russia aimed at cleaning up some of the country's contaminated rivers, polluted industrial sites and toxic waste dumps, and said it was the first step in a broad program to undo seven decades of environmental mismanagement.
By international standards the loan is small, about $110 million.
But bank officials, who have been heavily criticized for financing huge infrastructure projects in the developing world with little regard for their environmental effects, insisted today that the loan symbolized a change of direction that took place several years ago in the bank's lending, and is being speeded.


IN PERFORMANCE: CLASSICAL MUSIC
New Sopranos Take Over Lead Roles in 'Arabella'  Metropolitan Opera
Two promising singers made their Met debuts in "Arabella" on Monday night: Julia Faulkner, in the title role, and Mary Mills, as Zdenka.
Ms.
Faulkner caused a stir when she won the Met's National Council Auditions in 1985, but she has since pursued her career largely in Europe, working in Vienna and Munich, Germany.


The Giants Stare Across Talent Gap
Dallas wide receiver Alvin Harper, who injured his knee against the Giants Monday night after a freakish end to the first half, had a warning for the Giants.
"He cheap-shotted me," Harper said of Giants cornerback Tito Wooten.
"All I've got to tell them is the last game of the year somebody is going to get hurt."
First, it doesn't seem that Wooten, a rookie, was intentionally trying to hurt Harper in the fight-filled finish at halftime of the 38-10 blowout.
Second, Harper's warning that the Cowboys would retaliate when the two teams meet again in the final regular-season game is like a giant threatening to smash a flea.


Dow Rises 21.87 as Voting And Bonds Provide a Lift
Stock traders, possibly looking forward to a Republican victory in midterm Congressional elections, bid up stock prices yesterday in brisk trading.
But a small rally in the bond market, the first gains in seven sessions, probably provided the biggest lift to stocks, analysts said.
And the stock market rally was limited.
Barely one stock rose in price for every one stock that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.
There were 1,118 advancers and 1,061 decliners.


Archie San Romani, A 1930's Miler, 82
Archie San Romani, a Kansas coal miner's son who overcame a severe childhood accident to become one of the world's leading milers in the 1930's, died Monday at a nursing home in Auberry, Calif.
He was 82 and a resident of Fresno, Calif.
The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said.


Microsoft and Visa in Software Deal
Staking another claim in the emerging market for electronic commerce, the Microsoft Corporation said today that it had entered an agreement with Visa International to provide technology for secure electronic bank-card transactions across public and private computer networks.
The deal comes less than a month after Microsoft agreed to acquire Intuit Inc., the leading producer of personal finance software, in a stock swap valued at about $1.5 billion.


Tense Times for France-Africa Tie
Rather than a fond summing-up of nearly half a century of deep involvement in African affairs, the 18th so-called Franco-African summit meeting was marked by unusual soul-searching on the part of French commentators and African officials.
Heard amid, and often over, the traditional French statements of solidarity with Africa has been an uncomfortable debate over France's role in the Rwandan crisis and questions about its continuing close ties to leaders who, despite elections and reforms, have continued to rule as dictators.


For Squatters, Options Are Few in a Costly City
To the Editor:
As a longtime resident of Manhattan's East Village, I cannot accept Kate Walter's arguments in "Plight of Squatters Merits No Sympathy" (letter, Nov. 2).

What is moving into a gutted building on a drug-infested block and renovating it at your own cost?
What alternative is there in a city where tiny studios rent for $700 and two-bedroom apartments under $900 are rarities?

U.N. Debates an End to Bosnia Arms Embargo
The Security Council began a debate tonight on a resolution calling for an end to the arms embargo against the Muslim-led Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
At the center of the discussion is a General Assembly resolution passed Thursday that asks the Security Council to consider exempting the Muslim-led Bosnian Government from a general embargo imposed on the former Yugoslavia in 1991.

An article in Business Day yesterday about stock trading on Monday referred incorrectly to comments by an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Company.
The analyst, Barbara Osborn, did not express pessimism about the quarterly earnings of Cisco Systems Inc.; she said the company would meet but not exceed Wall Street forecasts.
She also said Cisco would increase its inventory, if possible; she did not say the company's order backlog was lower than expected.

TV News Magazines Falter
In the latest sign that television news magazines have lost favor as prime-time programming, both ABC and Fox are backing away from commitments to such programs.
ABC News announced yesterday that it would scale back the news magazine "Turning Point" from a weekly series to specials, beginning in January.
Fox announced on Monday that it was putting its news magazine, "Full Disclosure," on hold before it even got on the air.

Ralph W. G. Wyckoff, a research scientist who achieved renown in electron microscopy and crystallography, died on Thursday at a nursing home in Tucson, Ariz., where he lived.

CHRONICLE
Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, Democrat of Colorado, who is known for riding his Harley past the august buildings of Washington, says the image of motorcyclists as menacing toughs is an unfair, out-of-date stereotype.
The Senator showed up at a party Sunday in Livermore, Calif., celebrating the end of parole for a founder of the Hell's Angels, RALPH H. (SONNY) BARGER, The Associated Press reported.
"These clubs are much different now," the Senator said.
"They're very respectable."


Knicks Sign Starks, and the Lakers Pay the Price
The Knicks got more than they bargained for in their home opener last night, but they got a victory -- if just barely.
Using a 43-point third quarter to overcome a 20-point first half deficit, the Knicks (2-0) outlasted the Los Angeles Lakers, 117-113, to kick off the home season before a capacity crowd at Madison Square Garden.
It was the largest deficit from which the Knicks had rallied to win since April 1991, when they also overcame a 20-point deficit at home to defeat the Indiana Pacers.

A resident of West Hartford, he was 87.
He suffered a long illness, his family said.


A Vote Against Clinton
It was an immoderate campaign, coarse in its tone and unedifying in its substance, and the nation's politics are likely to stay that way for the next two years and beyond.
Dissatisfaction with President Clinton, with liberalism, with the Democratic Party and with Washington in general combined to create a surge by Republicans, especially conservative Republicans.
If not quite a tidal wave, yesterday's results swept dozens of incumbents from office and set up two years of intense political confrontation between the White House and Congress.


F.A.A. Considering Limit On Plane in Indiana Crash
The Federal Aviation Administration said yesterday that it would consider a recommendation that the make of commuter aircraft that crashed last week in Indiana be prohibited from flying in icy conditions.
The plane that crashed in a soybean field, killing 68 people, was a Avions de Transport Regional ATR-72.
The recommendation also includes the company's ATR-42.


Union Pacific's Santa Fe Offer Uses a Trust
The Union Pacific Corporation stepped up its battle for the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation last night, proposing a two-step transaction in which shareholders stand to get less money, but more security, from the Union Pacific deal.
Under terms of its tender offer, Union Pacific would buy 57 percent of Santa Fe's shares for $17.50 apiece -- about $10 a share in cash and $7.50 a share in Union Pacific stock.
It would also offer shareholders a way to circumvent the uncertainty of waiting for regulatory approvals that could scuttle the deal.


Minorities and Women Win Airwave Licenses
In a further sign that the nation's airwaves are worth plenty on the open market, the Federal Government received bids today totaling nearly $400 million in its third set of auctions of wireless-radio licenses.
At stake were 30 regional licenses for two-way paging services, with each license covering about one-fifth of the country.
Today's results, when added to those of the auction in July for 10 nationwide paging licenses, bring the total to be received so far from selling the airwaves to more than $1.1 billion.

Downtown Dining
When the Vista Hotel reopened last week, nearly two years after it was severely damaged in the bombing of the World Trade Center, two of its restaurants also reopened.
The Greenhouse Cafe is serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the Tall Ships Bar and Grill serves lunch and dinner from a hearty American menu.
The hotel is replacing its American Harvest restaurant with three private dining rooms called the Harvest Rooms.
The rooms are to open in January with the 16,000 or so bottles of wine from Windows on the World, which used to be run by Hilton International, the owner of the Vista.
When Windows reopens, it will be run by the Joseph Baum &amp; Michael Whiteman Company.
The Stanhope Reopens
This is preview week at the Restaurant in the Stanhope Hotel, East 81st Street and Fifth Avenue.
Scott Cohen, the new executive chef, is putting the finishing touches on his American menu prior to the restaurant's official reopening on Saturday evening.
The dining room, now on two levels, with a view of Fifth Avenue, has a less formal look and serves lunch and dinner, with dinner entrees from $17.50 to $25.
That's Italian!
This evening, Tony May's Hostaria and Gastronomia will open in Port Chester, N.Y., at 25 South Regent Street.
Mr.
May, who owns San Domenico in Manhattan, has every Italian dining trend covered in his new restaurant and catering shop, including a vast antipasto display, designer pizzas, family-style platters and old-fashioned comfort food like spaghetti and meatballs.
There is even a bank of television sets tuned to news and sports over the bar.
For those whose idea of a spectator sport is watching chefs flinging pizza dough in the air, video cameras will also bring that activity to the screen.
A Tavern or Two or Three
Tavern (of one sort or another) is definitely the hot restaurant name.
Mrs.
Park's Tavern, a lower-priced spinoff of New York's Park Avenue Cafe, has just opened in the Doubletree Guest Quarters, in Chicago just off Michigan Avenue.
In January, a Chicago clone of Park Avenue Cafe is also to open in the adjacent space.
Alan Stillman, the president of the New York Restaurant Group, which owns the restaurants, said that there were plans to open Park Avenue Cafes in Philadelphia and Boston.
White Truffles for Dinner

G.O.P. WINS CONTROL OF SENATE AND MAKES BIG GAINS IN HOUSE; PATAKI DENIES CUOMO 4TH TERM
The Republican Party seized control of the Senate and moved within a few seats of capturing the House yesterday, winning eight Democratic seats in the Senate and at least 38 in the House.
The gains were the Republicans' strongest in decades and put them in position to thwart President Clinton and his legislative proposals for the next two years.
The Republican tide also extended to the races for governor in several important states that will be critical to Mr.
Clinton's hopes for re-election in 1996, including New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and California.


Market Place; Profits from higher-rate loans to low-income home buyers.
FOR a profitable mortgage-lending business, consumers with low incomes and checkered credit records marred by delinquent payments are not the usual prospects.
But they are the bread and butter for the United Companies Financial Corporation of Baton Rouge, La., and some other finance companies, which have found that low-income homeowners will mortgage their houses at relatively high interest rates to obtain loans unavailable from other sources.
While the traditional mortgage-lending business is slumping as interest rates rise and middle-class homeowners have stopped refinancing, some lenders in low-income areas are expanding rapidly.
With the help of Wall Street and bond insurance companies, these "B" and "C" loans issued to borrowers with credit blemishes are now routinely packaged into securities that can be sold readily in the financial markets.


U.S. Blamed for Soul's Wait in Limbo

But a month later, a bullet ended that dream.
While working in a Chinese take-out restaurant in the Bronx, Mr.
Yang, 33, was shot to death during a robbery.
Now friends and family members say his soul toils in limbo, between this world and the next.

The Pop Life
Strange Clubfellows
John Paul Jones, the former Led Zeppelin bassist and keyboardist, is scheduled to begin his first American tour since the band broke up 14 years ago.
But he won't be performing with his former bandmates Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, who will be reinterpreting old Zeppelin songs on their own tour next year sans Mr.
Jones.
And he won't be playing stadiums either.
Instead, he will be at the downtown club Irving Plaza performing avant-garde songs with the local singer and performance artist Diamanda Galas.
"I may miss the private plane," Mr.
Jones said, speaking by telephone from Berlin, "but on the other hand, I'm much more interested in new, alternative music now."
Since Led Zeppelin's demise, Mr.
Jones has received countless offers to work with what he described as "tedious formula rock bands." Though he recently produced a live acoustic comeback album for the 1970's Zeppelin-influenced pop group Heart, he has spurned most of those requests, preferring to collaborate with more cutting-edge bands and artists like the Butthole Surfers, R.E.M., Brian Eno and Ms.
Galas.


Paper Accuses Goalie of Fix
Bruce Grobbelaar, one of the most flamboyant goalies in British soccer, was accused today by the mass circulation tabloid The Sun of accepting bribes to throw matches.
The allegation, which Grobbelaar denied, threw Premier League British soccer into an uproar.
The sport has been slowly clawing its way to respectability here after all the problems of crowd violence in the 1970's and 1980's.
The Sun charged that Grobbelaar, a 37-year-old Zimbabwean, had accepted a bribe of $:40,000, or about $64,000, from a gambling syndicate in the Far East for agreeing to throw a league match last season against Newcastle, which won that game by 3-0.
The goalie was playing at the time for Liverpool.
He now plays for Southampton.


Capitalizing On Tainted Machine
In Essex County, where the Democratic Party has often seemed as immutable a fixture as the heavens or the earth, the Republicans are not supposed to rule.
But James W. Treffinger was able to capitalize on the problems of a Democratic machine that was tainted by corruption and rancorous infighting to capture the Essex County Executive's race on Tuesday.
Mr.
Treffinger, 44, the Mayor of Verona, N.J., and the only Republican on the County Board of Freeholders, presented himself as a reformer who would take a machete to the county tax rate and wipe out decades of Democratic patronage in county agencies.
He edged out his Democratic rival, Cardell Cooper, the Mayor of East Orange, N.J., by winning 51 percent of the vote.


Pataki Says No. 2 Will Have Real Role
The Governor-elect, George E. Pataki, said yesterday that his second-in-command, Elizabeth P. McCaughey, would not get lost in his shadow like some lieutenant governors and would have "very real and significant responsibilities."
He did not spell out those responsibilities but Ms.
McCaughey, a constitutional scholar and public policy expert, has written extensively on health care and has said that might be one area of interest.


Turning Back the Clock in Slovakia
Although he outpolled his rivals in Slovakia's elections last month, Vladimir Meciar remains unable to stitch together a government and get himself formally named prime minister.
But last week the Moscow-trained, rabble-rousing Mr.
Meciar proved once again that while he cannot rule, he can still wreck.
Just moments after the previous government resigned, he joined with parties from the far right and far left to railroad 13 measures through an all-night session of Parliament that sent Slovakia reeling back to the bad old days.
Mr.
Meciar was never able to command more than 83 votes in the 150-member Parliament during the session.
But with the opposition caught off guard and with only a simple majority required for legislation, he was able to do enormous damage to Slovakia's painful efforts to move toward a private economy and enlarge individual freedoms.
In effect, he turned back the clock.


Pataki Says No. 2 Will Have Real Role
The Governor-elect, George E. Pataki, said yesterday that his second-in-command, Elizabeth P. McCaughey, would not get lost in his shadow like some lieutenant governors and would have "very real and significant responsibilities."

Leadership in Albany: A Changing Cast
GOVERNOR  George E. Pataki
Mr.
Pataki, who will be New York's 53d governor, is the first Republican to be elected Governor since 1970 and the first without New York City roots since Nathan Miller of Syracuse 50 years before that.
Like Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, Mr.
Pataki, a 49-year-old State Senator who was an Assemblyman and a Mayor of Peekskill, inherits a politically divided Legislature that could be a check on his agenda.
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR  Elizabeth McCaughey
If Mr.
Pataki was the seasoned pol, Ms.
McCaughey, who is 46 and lives in Manhattan, was the ticket's policy wonk.
She was recruited from the confines of the Manhattan Institute.
The Pataki campaign was short on substance, but state government revels in details.
Will Ms.
McCaughey be the brains behind the Pataki administration, or be left behind altogether when the guys get down to business?
COMPTROLLER  H. Carl McCall
Elected by the Legislature last year to fill Edward V. Regan's unexpired term, the 58-year-old Mr.
McCall survived the Republican sweep as the lone Democrat -- and the first black -- elected to statewide office in Albany.
Typically, the comptroller is a naysayer, warning the Governor and Legislature not to spend what they don't have and berating them for past inefficiencies.
New accounting constraints and his political independence may amplify his voice.
ATTORNEY GENERAL  Dennis C. Vacco
As a former Federal prosecutor from Buffalo, he has promised to transform the office of Attorney General into a platform for changing the criminal justice system, and restoration of the death penalty has dominated his platform.
But the job is considerably broader than that, and Mr.
Vacco, who is 42, is largely untested as a consumer advocate and an architect of legislation within an attorney general's domain.
ASSEMBLY SPEAKER  Sheldon Silver
As the Assembly Speaker, this 18-year veteran of the Legislature becomes perhaps the most powerful Democrat in the state.
He is unabashedly liberal, resisting even some of Mr.
Cuomo's more moderate initiatives.
Moreover, as a New York City resident, representing the Lower East Side, he is likely to emerge as the city's chief defender in a state government that, presumably, will be less receptive to City Hall's legislative agenda.
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER  Ralph J. Marino
The Senate majority leader, who was the chief Republican check and balance on the Cuomo administration, retains his seat, representing part of Nassau and Suffolk, and the Republicans kept their majority.
But he may lose his leadership.
Mr.
Marino and his fellow Republican, Mr.
D'Amato, are political rivals and he only grudgingly endorsed Mr.
Pataki.
Ambiguously, Mr.
Pataki said only that he would not interfere when the Senate picks its leaders.

Some Who Are Close to Governor-Elect
A representative, but incomplete, guide to those who have the ear of Gov.-elect George E. Pataki.
MICHAEL FINNEGAN Former law partner, State Senate aide, campaign counsel, and old political friend.
Is to Mr.
Pataki what Peter J. Powers is to Rudolph W. Giuliani.
UNITED STATES SENATOR ALFONSE M. D'AMATO Helped anoint Mr.
Pataki with the party hierarchy, raised money and devised strategy for the campaign.
In exchange, Mr.
Pataki announced yesterday: "You can call me, Al." CLARENCE D. RAPPLEYEA JR.
Known as "Rapp," he was Mr.
Pataki's mentor in the Assembly, where he is minority leader.
A resident of the Southern Tier town of Norwich, the former stock car driver served as a campaign co-chairman and ambassador to upstate.
JOE HOLLAND Harlem lawyer and entrepreneur who owns an ice cream parlor and founded a homeless shelter.
Wanted to run for Attorney General but lost at the state Republican convention to Dennis C. Vacco, then played the good soldier by becoming co-chairman of the Pataki campaign.
CHARLES GARGANO D'Amato fund raiser who helped Mr.
Pataki raise $13 million, enough to outspend an incumbent Governor.
LIBBY PATAKI The only Pataki adviser who the Governor-elect met while body surfing in a hurricane off Long Island.
Wife and best friend since 1973.
Mother of four little Patakis.
Her first advice: take a vacation.
He listened.

Knicks to Magic: Prove Playoff Quality

They have become intense rivals, and many people have picked the Magic to dethrone New York as Eastern Conference champion.
But the Knicks believe they are still the better team.
And the center matchup between Patrick Ewing and Shaquille O'Neal offers a clash of premier players with different games and different personalities.


Not Just in Kansas Anymore; A Crop Artist Debuts on Manhattan's Unlikely Terrain
In Kansas, where Stan Herd is known for making art by planting arrangements of crops and flowers, pretty much all he needs is a tractor.
Trying to replicate the process in Manhattan, he found he needed Donald Trump and two homeless people as well as the tractor.
"I have to say I was overwhelmed by the whole task," Mr.
Herd said yesterday, patrolling the landscape image of trees and clouds that he fashioned with vegetables, other plants and gravel on a one-acre plot along the Hudson River between 68th and 70th Streets.
"I put more hours into this than any of the others I did. I like it, but some of the plants didn't grow as well as I would have preferred."


Just No Ball Playing In the House, Please
Politics and football forged a strong alliance on Election Day, with two former stars riding the Republican surge to seats in Congress from Oklahoma.
STEVE LARGENT, the star receiver for the Seattle Seahawks who retired in 1989, and J. C. WATTS, the quarterback who led Oklahoma to two straight Orange Bowl victories in the 1970's, were among the winners Tuesday on a day in which about a dozen sports figures ran for office.

Bernstein Songs Survive in 1953 Musical
The truth about the New York City Opera's new production of Leonard Bernstein's "Wonderful Town" on Tuesday night lay somewhere between the opinions of those who left during intermission muttering about how awful it was and those who stood and cheered the celebrated lyricists, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, during the curtain calls.
Bernstein's songs from this 1953 musical are as spirited as they ever were; the question is whether the show was always as campy and cliched as it was on Tuesday.
It's likely that even when it first opened to enthusiastic reviews, the show had a hint of camp, a hip humor based on a sense of superiority to the story's stock figurines.
Bernstein and the lyricists had stepped in at the last minute to rescue a failing enterprise, and in cobbling this show together in four weeks they relied on character types for effect, leaning a bit on their earlier collaborative success, "On the Town."

As Washington's Old Order Gives Way, No Clear Signs From the New
For American business, the immediate post-election impact from the Republican Party victories is the new faces coming to the fore in Washington as committee chairmanships change hands.
Even so, the shift in control may not result in radical departures from current Congressional policies.
Here is a look at several leading industries most likely to be at the top of the agenda next year:

F.A.A. Restricts Some Icy-Weather Flying
The Federal Aviation Administration today barred airlines that fly planes like the one that crashed last week in Indiana from using automatic flight controls, or autopilot, during icy conditions.
Federal safety officials say if the plane that crashed had been under manual control, instead of autopilot, the pilot might have noticed if the plane had encountered an icing problem.
There have been suggestions that icing was a cause of the crash of the plane, an ATR-72.
All 68 people aboard were killed.

The Election's Fallout for the Economy; Trade Vote Is First Test For Victors
Newly victorious Republicans and a humbled Clinton Administration face their first big test even before the new Congress takes over in January, in a scheduled vote after Thanksgiving on whether to approve a long-delayed world trade pact.
Both parties say they support the 123-nation agreement hammered out under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is known as GATT and is considered to be one of the most important economic initiatives of the last decade.
But the two sides still find themselves at odds as soon as they start discussing its details.


Women in Canada Upset by Court Rulings on Drunkenness
Women's advocacy groups are expressing outrage at recent criminal cases in Canada in which drunkenness has been successfully used as a defense in assaults against women.
The fury erupted in September when the Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Montreal man who, after consuming seven or eight beers and 35 ounces of brandy, according to testimony, pulled a 65-year-old woman out of a wheelchair and sexually assaulted her.

The Election's Fallout for the Economy; Stocks Rise, But Euphoria Doesn't Last
Traders stormed into the stock market like a herd of elephants yesterday morning, pushing prices sharply higher in the wake of the Republican sweep of the House, the Senate and the governors' mansions.
But few investors followed them, and by the end of the day the herd had turned into bears as Wall Street debated the effect of the Republican victory; after falling at midday, blue-chip stocks recovered to eke out a tiny gain.

Zap! Zap! The Allies Update War Games
Six years ago, the Army had to fly in 17,500 soldiers from the United States and deploy 7,000 armored vehicles and nearly 1,100 tanks to practice the kind of epic battles the NATO alliance would have to fight if World War III broke out.

While Republicans touted their electoral surge on Tuesday as a repudiation of President Clinton and an endorsement of conservative Republican policies, there was little evidence that these motivations moved most voters.
Instead, voters who were surveyed as they were leaving their polling places blamed a host of factors for the nation's failures in solving problems.
Indeed, a majority said that special interest groups and members of Congress from both parties were more at fault than the Clinton Administration.

The other two were found a short time later, hiding inside the center.

THE 1994 ELECTIONS: PARTIES - THE OUTLOOK: As One Party Prepares to Run the Capitol, the Other Hunts for Leaders; On the Morning After, the Democrats Try to Come to Grips With Disorder
The state of Congress's Democratic minority in the aftermath of Tuesday's elections is simple enough that it can be summed up in three words: utter, complete disarray.
The party's top legislative leaders have either retired or been defeated, and their troops have seen the party's stewardship of Congress brutally rejected at the polls.
Who will replace the leaders is unknown.
And the new Republican majority is intent on slashing Congressional staff positions across the board, a move that will even further reduce the Democratic presence on Capitol Hill.


As State Split, High Turnout Upstate Elected Pataki and Reflected Change
George E. Pataki won the governorship on the strength of sweepingly high voter turnout in the upstate areas that make up his base, where nearly 70 percent of registered voters went to the polls on Tuesday, compared to just under half in New York City and just over half in the suburban counties around it.
Those differences demonstrated the profound lack of enthusiasm for Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo in the downstate areas where he needed extraordinary voter turnout to win, and reflected a sweeping change in urban voter participation since Mr.
Cuomo's first election in 1982, when turnout was just over 70 percent statewide and 66 percent in the city.


Two Sides May Talk, But Will They Move?
When baseball's labor negotiators last held a bargaining session, the players were in the 29th day of their strike.
Today, on Day 91, the negotiators will resume talks, but no more optimism exists now than two months ago.
"I have no reason to believe things will be different this time," Donald Fehr, the union leader, said yesterday.
"I hope I'll be pleasantly surprised, but I don't see that happening. The club position seems as fixed as it was on June 14. We'll see if it's anything different."

Now Comes the Hardest Part: Repealing That Hateful Tax
On the morning after the Republican John G. Rowland was elected governor with 36 percent of the vote, he began the difficult job of broadening support for his plan to eliminate the income tax, reaching out to Democrats and independents and describing his victory as a message about the public's feelings concerning government.
"It's a mood," he said.
"I think people of this country, let alone this state, want someone who will reverse the trends of the Great Society that has been around for the last 30 years."

The Endgame: For Pataki, Fighting Giuliani Became the Way to Fight Cuomo
In the moments after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani endorsed Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo for re-election, strategists for State Senator George E. Pataki held their collective breaths.
Should they ignore it?
Should they denounce Mr.
Giuliani as a turncoat?
In 48 hours they had their answer.
Mr.
Pataki was dropping precipitously in their internal polls.
Within four days, what had been a 7- to 8-point Pataki lead had become a 13-point deficit.
Among some Pataki advisers, panic set in.


Who Won Where - The Races For the U.S. Senate


Northeast
CONNECTICUT
If there is a survival model for shaken Democrats, it would seem to be Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who in one term has soared to seeming invincibility with his moderate views and superior connections that include many prosperous supporters in New York and Hollywood.
Despite being a friend of President Clinton, he defeated Gerald Labriola, a retired pediatrician and former State Senator whose campaign never took shape, by more than 2 to 1 and consolidated his hold on one of his party's most secure Senate seats.
But the crowded governor's race, dominated by debate over taxes, seemed to offer few lessons.
John G. Rowland, a Republican and former Representative, outlasted three opponents, the closest being William E. Curry Jr., the Democratic state controller, after a disclosure late in the campaign that Mr.
Rowland had tried to suppress a police report about a quarrel with his former wife.

Dealers Buying Again At Impressionist Sales
There's been a sea change in the market for Impressionist and modern art.
At this week's auctions, which ended last night at Christie's, buyers tended to be either serious connoisseurs or dealers.
Gone are the days of impulse buying.
Gone, too, is a market so inflated that dealers and old-time collectors were priced out.
Almost half the works sold last night were bought by dealers.
At Sotheby's on Tuesday night, dealers snapped up 25 percent of the sale.


America Online Buys 2 Internet Companies
America Online Inc., facing a challenge from the Microsoft Corporation in the market for on-line computer services, said yesterday that it had acquired two small Internet service companies for a total of more than $34 million in stock.

The companies, which are start-ups that have generated no revenue to date, make software that allow businesses and consumers to more easily use the Internet, especially the rapidly growing area known as the World Wide Web.

Recycled Products: The 'Ugly' Factor
IT'S been a long time since "Don't, don't, don't be a litterbug," a jingle associated with the Keep America Beautiful movement of the 1960's, wormed its way into our collective consciousness.
Recycling today is a lot more complicated and has gone far beyond merely tossing trash into the nearest garbage can.
Now, it's de rigueur to sort, tie and leave it neatly stacked at the curb.
The next step is to actually buy products made of trash, bringing our refuse back indoors.
That's the message broadcast by "Hello Again! Recycling for the Real World," an upbeat exhibition at the Fashion Institute of Technology, showcasing more than 250 recycled products, from plastic milk bottles reincarnated as a kayak to a couture gown with beer-can spangles.

After 18 annual legislative launchings followed by 18 annual crash landings due to gubernatorial vetoes, the death penalty now seems likely to become a sentencing option faced by New York murderers by next November.
At a news conference yesterday, Governor-elect George E. Pataki wasted no time reiterating his campaign promise to sign a bill to restore the death penalty, which would make New York the 38th state in the nation with such a law.

Nets' First Victory Features Benjamin In a Starring Role
Maybe it was the criticism directed at him by Coach Butch Beard.
Maybe it was Beard's insistence that he join the team huddle with 2 minutes 16 seconds left; something about "sitting down and shutting up." Maybe it was the idea of not starting, a real possibility if he continued to produce at a pace consistent with the hatching of larvae.
At any rate, Benoit Benjamin, Everybody's Favorite Net to Pick On, turned in one of his rare inspiring performances tonight at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.
Benjamin, maligned for his 5 points-per-game average and questionable effort after three games, erupted for 22 points and 13 rebounds as the Nets defeated the Chicago Bulls, 110-109.

YACHT RACING  Rescue Boat Arrives  Newcastle Australia, the 60-foot yacht that rescued the shipwrecked BOC round-the-world racer, Josh Hall, arrived in Cape Town on Tuesday afternoon.
On board were Hall and Newcastle's skipper, Alan Nebauer.
The sailor from Australia picked up Hall in the South Atlantic Ocean on Oct. 18, eight hours after Hall's 60-footer hit a submerged object.
Nebauer -- a day after leaving Charleston, S.C., at the start of the race -- hit an abandoned Cuban refugee raft, which damaged Newcastle's keel.
Arnet Taylor Jr., a BOC racer from Portsmouth, N.H., arrived in Cape Town earlier Tuesday.


Both Candidates Claim Victory
Representative Sam Gejdenson, a seven-term Democrat from eastern Connecticut, claimed victory by a few hundred votes today in one of the closest Congressional elections in the nation.
His Republican opponent, Edward W. Munster, also claimed victory by about the same margin.
The race is heading for a recount, required by state law when the margin is within one half of 1 percent of the total vote.
Mr.
Gejdenson's campaign said that out of slightly more than 185,000 votes, he got 470 votes more than Mr.
Munster.
The Associated Press also gave Mr.
Gejdenson the victory, by 5 votes, 79,172 to 79,167.
Mr.

It was a high-spending race that drew support from the national Republican Party, which made Mr.
Klein's seat a target for a takeover.

Searching through the millions of glistening words that constituted Mario M. Cuomo's final campaign for governor, it is difficult to find more than a handful in which he explained how his fourth term would have been different from the previous three.
It did not matter that the popular demand for change became so incessant that he could not have mistaken its threatening implications for his career.
He declined, for reasons of principle, pride and a trademarked stiffness of neck, to pay tribute to that national mood, instead attacking it in speech after speech as a Republican construct.

Nonetheless, his defeat on Tuesday was considered a huge upset in the ward politics of Chicago, which in earlier times did not find indictments particularly troublesome.
As expected, Gov.
Jim Edgar won a second term, trouncing his Democratic challenger, Dawn Clark Netsch.
In other Congressional races, one other Republican managed to win a seat that had been in Democratic hands.
The district in Joliet that has been held by Representative George E. Sangmeister, a Democrat who is retiring, was won by State Representative Gerald C. Weller, a Republican.

Lautenberg, the two-term Democrat who has begun each of his political campaigns as the presumed loser, stood again in the winner's circle today.
"We saw a tidal wave sweep across this country with the majority changing hands in both houses of the Congress in proportions that were never dreamed of," Mr.
Lautenberg said today at his first news conference since his victory Tuesday night over Chuck Haytaian, a Republican and Speaker of the State Assembly.
"But we think that there is a message that one can stand as an individual, proud of one's party and buck the tide."

Worried that a new accounting rule might make crises in the financial market worse, Federal bank regulators announced a narrow exception yesterday aimed at preventing unintended Federal takeovers of commercial banks.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is part of the Treasury Department, announced yesterday that banks would be required to follow the rule except in determining whether they retained enough capital to cover possible losses on loans and other investments.

PATAKI BEGINNING BID TO TRANSFORM STATE GOVERNMENT
After a late night of celebration, Governor-elect George E. Pataki set about transforming his campaign into a government yesterday, pledging to move quickly to enact the death penalty and a deep tax cut.
The extent of the challenge quickly became evident when Cuomo administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the state could face a budget shortfall next year of $4 billion or more.
A gap of that size -- the state's general fund budget is $34 billion this year -- could make it exceedingly difficult for Mr.
Pataki to deliver the first stage of his promise to cut income tax rates by 25 percent over four years.

So, I hope that the President and the Democrats in the Congress will take seriously the American people's choices, and give us a chance to work with them to try to do some good things for the country. . . .

Vacco Savors Victory as a Mandate for the Death Penalty
In his first campaign for elective office, Dennis C. Vacco had a simple message: Let's get tough on crime, and as attorney general I'll help you get a death penalty in New York.
It was apparently a message that many voters wanted to hear.
Mr.
Vacco, the Republican candidate, squeezed by his Democratic opponent, Karen S. Burstein, 50 percent to 47 percent, according to the latest results, with most of those supporting him saying in exit polls that they favored the death penalty.
The margin of victory was almost the same as in the gubernatorial race, in which George E. Pataki, also a proponent of the death penalty, defeated Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, who opposes it.

Boston Journal; Suspicion Is Legacy Of Odd Life
When Mary Guzelian was killed by a taxi nine years ago at the age of 68, few people would have guessed what was inside the shopping bags she toted around as she panhandled in the elegant Back Bay neighborhood here, wearing two heavy coats at a time even on hot summer days.
The bags were filled with money, thousands of dollars.
And there was even more money squirreled away in Ms.
Guzelian's home, mixed in among the trash, rotting food and human waste that fouled the subsidized apartment where she lived even though she owned two large houses.

BUSINESS DIGEST
The Election's Fallout  The long-delayed world trade agreement will be the first test of the new alignment in Washington.
Although both parties say they support the pact, known as GATT, they still find themselves at odds as soon as they start discussing its details.  [ Page D1. ] Euphoria over the Republican sweep quickly faded on Wall Street, with the Dow industrials eking out a tiny gain of 1.01 point.  [ D1. ]


THEATER
Finding a 'Gift Horse,' With Talmudic Roots  Theater 91
Michael Hardstark loves snappy lines, and he writes good ones; but his passion runs away with him in "The Gift Horse," being produced by the Jewish Repertory Theater.
The plot itself is simply one running transparent joke, and in a performance of more than two hours all the wisecracks put into the mouths of seven of the nine characters add up to too much of a good thing.

Student Is Shot at a High School in New Haven
A sophomore at Wilbur Cross High School was shot outside the school cafeteria this morning in the aftermath of an argument that began the night before, school officials said.
It was the first time a student had been shot by another student in the New Haven school system, authorities said.
Last December, a 15-year-old boy shot himself in the foot in a public school here.

U.S. Promises To Maintain Foreign Policy
Secretary of State Warren Christopher came to Seoul to tell the South Koreans that Washington was committed to their security.
But today he found himself reassuring them that Republican victories in Congress would not change the course of American foreign policy.
Mr.
Christopher's words were also intended as a message to the rest of the world -- most immediately to the foreign leaders that he and President Clinton will meet in Asia in the coming days -- that they should not overreact to the extraordinary shift of power in Washington.

After a Strong Start, Capriati Loses Steam
Resurfacing from a 14-month sabbatical from professional tennis that turned out to be more debilitating than exhilarating, Jennifer Capriati made a spirited return tonight to the sport she abandoned in despair after it broke her spirit last year.
The comeback did not, by conventional standards, end happily.
The unranked 18-year-old, appearing in her first tournament since the first-round 1993 United States Open loss that provoked her exit, was defeated, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, by 13th-ranked Anke Huber of Germany.


How Democrat McCall Navigated a G.O.P. Flood
H.
Carl McCall stood before supporters yesterday and tried to explain why he, the candidate who looked most vulnerable a week ago, was the only Democrat left standing after a Republican sweep of the four statewide governmental offices.
"Obviously, the people of New York State want somebody to watch all the other fellows," he said, half-joking, not long after Republicans won the offices of governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general but not comptroller, which he claimed for himself.


ON THE ROAD WITH: Brooke Shields; Coping, From Toe to Head to Heart
THE morning after her opening night here in the road show of "Grease!" finds Brooke Shields padding around her hotel suite in bare feet, which, thanks to bunion surgery, are now as lovely as the rest of her.
"I had to have both feet broken," she says, wincing, "but now I can wear high heels without three Tylenols."
Along with her born-again feet, the 29-year-old actress has a born-again Christian boyfriend, the world class tennis player Andre Agassi, 24.
He was a perfect brick during her long convalescence last winter, it seems, even though he himself was recovering from wrist surgery.

Researchers Ask Whether Prenatal Care Truly Saves Money
Prenatal care is often described as preventive medicine that pays for itself by averting future costs, but a new analysis says the savings have not been substantiated.
The investigators hasten to add that prenatal care is medically important and that all pregnant women should receive it.
But they say the argument that for every dollar spent far more will be saved is a myth.

His Man Unhorsed, Giuliani Confronts His Political Plight
Having gambled and lost in his dramatic endorsement of Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has now been left needing millions of dollars of assistance from the state but facing a Republican governor who owes him nothing and drew little of his support from New York City.
In a sign of his political plight, the Mayor admitted yesterday that he had twice called Governor-elect George E. Pataki since his victory, but had not heard back.


Hewlett-Packard to Sell Notebooks
The Hewlett-Packard Company, aiming to complete its personal computer line, said today that it would introduce two new color notebook computers on Thursday, marking its entry in this fast-growing segment of the market.
Hewlett-Packard has been the most successful maker of so-called personal digital assistants, or P.D.A.'s.
The company's Omnibook 300, a black-and-white subnotebook, has also been popular, and the maker's line of desktop PC's has taken off recently, after years of slow sales.
But to become a full-range player, analysts have said, the company needed a line of notebook machines.

Drugs May Slow Alzheimer's Disease
To the Editor:
Former President Ronald Reagan's disclosure that he has Alzheimer's disease is saddening (front page, Nov. 6).


Assembly Can Brake G.O.P.
H.
Carl McCall, the State Comptroller, will be the only Democratic official to hold statewide office come January.
But the most powerful Democrat in Albany, when the post-Mario M. Cuomo era begins in two months, is more likely to be Sheldon Silver, the Speaker of the Assembly.
Mr.
Silver, the quiet veteran state legislator from Manhattan's Lower East Side, will be in a position to shape and perhaps even block much of Governor-elect George E. Pataki's agenda.
Mr.
Pataki's core campaign pledge, a 25 percent reduction in the state's personal income tax rate, must go for approval to the Democratic-controlled Assembly, which Mr.
Silver leads, and to the Republican-dominated Senate.
The coming battles over whether to approve the tax cuts, when to impose them, how to trim state spending and how to protect local communities from a loss of vital state aid, will all inevitably find themselves right on Mr.
Silver's desk.

Penney Chief To Quit Post By Year-End
The J. C. Penney Company said yesterday that its chairman, William R. Howell, would step down as chief executive on Jan. 1, putting in place a succession plan before his anticipated retirement in a few years.
As part of the plan, the retailer named James E. Oesterreicher, 53, vice chairman and chief executive.
Mr.
Oesterreicher, who began his Penney's career in 1954 as a management trainee in Lansing, Mich., is currently president of Penney stores and catalogue, a post he has held since 1992.


Minimalism, Out; Romanticism, In
Two of the best dance works you will see this season are "A Brahms Symphony" and "Fandango." It is no accident that Lar Lubovitch is their choreographer.
In recent years, Mr.
Lubovitch's versatility has obscured his true calling, which is putting movement together with the mastery of someone who recognizes the passion of pure dancing.
"A Brahms Symphony," created in 1985, is a virtual surge of sweeping movement, while "Fandango" (1990) is the opposite, an erotic duet whose shapes are intricately pieced together, jigsaw-style.


As Washington's Old Order Gives Way, No Clear Signs From the New
For American business, the immediate post-election impact from the Republican Party victories is the new faces coming to the fore in Washington as committee chairmanships change hands.
Even so, the shift in control may not result in radical departures from current Congressional policies.
Here is a look at several leading industries most likely to be at the top of the agenda next year:


The Right Way to Listen to Ragas: Carefully
"Follow the song," said Manilal Nag in the Tishman Auditorium of the New School on Friday night, explaining how his style of Indian music must be heard.
"First you must listen to the voice."
And then Mr.
Nag demonstrated, his voice barely audible, sliding down to a note, gliding past it, bending slightly above it, wavering back and forth before sounding its center and sliding to the next pitch.
He then imitated precisely the same vocal gesture on the sitar, the instrument's frets becoming irrelevant as the strings were bent and pressed into microtonal expression.


Enduring a Disease That Steals the Soul
I DID not laugh at the Ronald Reagan witticisms when they erupted this week, as they had to.
I suppose I can understand the impulse; how else but with mordant humor to cope with the terror of an unpredictable and fatal illness that corrupts the memory and steals the soul?
But Alzheimer's disease ceased to be funny to me in 1984, when my father was first diagnosed with the ailment that scoured his memory and assaulted his brain so viciously, and helped to kill him seven years later.

When the People Spoke, Federal Term Limits Gained
The people of seven states voted on Tuesday in favor of term limits for members of Congress, and Republican leaders predicted yesterday that Congress would soon propose a constitutional amendment to achieve that goal.
With the new balloting, 22 states have now voted to impose term limits on Federal lawmakers, despite many questions about the legality of such restrictions when imposed by state law or a state constitution.
On the other hand, there is no doubt that a properly drafted amendment to the Federal Constitution could limit the tenure of members of Congress, just as the 22d Amendment, ratified in 1951, set a two-term limit for Presidents.

Ye Historic Drag Strip
DESIGNATED historic places aren't just turreted mansions and spired churches.
Drag strips have historic significance, too.
In August, the National Hot Rod Association Drag Strip at Great Bend, Kan., was listed on the Register of Historic Kansas Places not because it is a glorious piece of architecture -- it is a concrete runway 150 feet wide by 7,999 feet long -- but because it was the site of the first national drag race championship sanctioned by the group, which was held Sept. 29 through Oct. 2, 1955.


Fewest U.S. Farms Since 1850: 1.9 Million
Continuing a trend that began six decades ago, the number of American farms has dipped below two million for the first time since before the Civil War, the Census Bureau said today.
The bureau, which produces a farm census every five years, counted 1,925,300 farms in the United States in 1992, the lowest number since 1850.
The decline has been steady since 1935, when the total number of farms peaked at 6.8 million as the Depression began the migration off the land and into the cities.


Can Treatment Ever Cure Sex Offenders?
To the Editor:
"Remembering Megan" (editorial, Nov. 5) questions the focus in New Jersey's new legislation on informing communities about convicted sex offenders released in their midst, as opposed to a focus on treatment programs in New Jersey's prisons and juvenile facilities.


Was Hemingway Gay? There's More to His Story
HEMINGWAY'S GENDERS Rereading the Hemingway Text  By Nancy R. Comley and Robert Scholes  Illustrated. 154 pages.
Yale University Press. $23.
For some years now and in several recent biographies, evidence has been gathering that Ernest Hemingway was not, after all, the avatar of monolithic masculinity that he was once so universally assumed to be.


Michael O'Donoghue, 54, Dies; Writer for 'Saturday Night Live'
Michael O'Donoghue, a comedy writer who helped create two of his generation's best-known institutions of humor, National Lampoon magazine and the NBC television show "Saturday Night Live," died yesterday in Manhattan.
He was 54 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said his wife, Cheryl Hardwick.


A Daughter's Death, a Father's Guilt
Out by the noisy sawmill, the trailer parks, the taxidermist and the scrubby bait shops where Bobby Crabtree lives, there is very little mystery why he shot the daughter he doted on early Sunday morning.
And the idea of blaming Mr.
Crabtree for what happened when his high-spirited 14-year-old, Matilda Kaye, decided to play a practical joke on him, is far removed from the minds of most.
He might have acted a little hastily, some say tentatively.
But there are more people who not only sympathize with the 53-year-old ice-company driver but see themselves doing the same thing.

Salomon Says It May Take Charge Against Its Earnings
Salomon Inc. announced yesterday that it may be forced to take an unspecified charge against earnings in the fourth quarter because of "certain unreconciled balances" on its books.
But the charge, if taken, will not have any appreciable affect on its overall financial position, the company said.
The potential reserve, which was first disclosed in the company's latest quarterly filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, came to light as a result of Salomon's transition in the last several years from a centralized computer system to one relying on networks of smaller machines.
While reviewing data bases containing the company's accounts, the "unreconciled balances" were discovered, the filing said.

Rwandan Refugees in Zaire Still Fear to Return
The simple Rwandan peasant woman, a widow unable to read or write, uncertain of her age, wonders if she will ever see her three sons again.
The eldest of Margarita Icymanizanye's three sons, in turn, wonders if he will ever see his mother.
He fled Rwanda during the spring and summer's deadly civil war, and now yearns to return home to be near her.
His hope is to take his wife and their five children back to their house in Kigali.


'Homicide' Survives, But in What Condition?
There's more than one way to snuff the life out of a television series.
For a while, it looked as if "Homicide: Life on the Street" would simply be murdered by NBC as the rule-breaking and stubbornly downbeat police show was shunted from one day and time period to another, leaving even its fans confused.
But now "Homicide" is ensconced in a Fridays-at-10 P.M. slot, not the best spot on the weekly schedule, but at least a steady gig.
Furthermore, the network has just announced, even as ratings remain soft, an order for seven more episodes that will take the series well into 1995.
Sometimes, it seems, the system works.

Foley, Defending Congress to the Last, Concedes Election Defeat by Newcomer
The House Speaker, Representative Thomas S. Foley, a 30-year incumbent, has always said that the best way to insure term limits was at the ballot box.
On Tuesday, voters in eastern Washington followed his advice.
Mr.
Foley conceded today at midday, even though he trailed the Republican challenger, George Nethercutt, by only 2,200 votes with 14,000 absentee ballots still to be counted.
The odds appeared too long to make up, Mr.
Foley said.

Quarterback Kent Graham was lifting weights this morning when Giants Coach Dan Reeves said he had to speak with him.
Graham knew that Reeves probably wasn't pulling him aside to invite him home for dinner with the family.
Reeves told Graham he was going to make a change at quarterback.
Looking for anything to jump-start the team -- anything -- Reeves said today that he was going to bench Dave Brown, the man anointed as the team's quarterback of the future, in favor of Graham.
The Giants have lost six straight games and they will do anything to end their misery.

AT&amp;T Gets Mexico Partner For Long-Distance Service
Making its bid for one of the biggest prizes in the Mexican economy, the AT&amp;T Corporation announced a $1 billion alliance today with a Mexican partner, Grupo Industrial Alfa S.A., that would provide long-distance telephone service when the present Government-approved monopoly ends in 1997.
Analysts had expected AT&amp;T to decide to enter the expanding Mexican market, but were surprised by its selection of Alfa, an industrial group that manufactures diverse products ranging from cold-cut meats to flat steel, but has no telephone experience.


The New Era of Instability
Since 1968, there has been much talk of a "Republican realignment." Quieted by Bill Clinton's victory in 1992, it resounds again after Tuesday's Republican victories.
This election may in fact hail the emergence of a 20-year Republican lock not only on the Presidency but also on Congress and the statehouses.
But it is more likely to usher in an era of greater political turbulence characterized by empty sloganeering, mean-spirited campaigning and the growth of local and national third parties -- an era in which neither Democrats nor Republicans can count on stable majorities.

Anxieties About a Mother Harming Her Children
THE confessed killing of two little boys by their mother in Union, S.C., horrified the nation last week.
The incident may also have terrified youngsters across the country.


In Stock: Design du Jour; Peeling Paint and More Trends at 3 Stores
LEAVES scattered to the wind, overturned baskets, weather-beaten signs, prairie kitchen tables with layers of peeling paint, banged-up watering cans, trailing ivy and rusted urns.
These are a few of the favorite things in the city's most stylish stores.
At a time when trying to define new directions in home design has become a freewheeling parlor game, three shops -- one with a decidedly French accent, another that offers a romantic take on the "wrong side of the tracks" and a third that seems like nothing so much as a secret garden -- offer some signposts.


One Hand Tied, Clinton Offers the Other
Even as President Clinton reached out to victorious Republicans, the White House was casting about today for ways to govern that would not require Congressional cooperation.
Looking somewhat chastened and sounding very conciliatory at a White House news conference, President Clinton accepted his share of responsibility for the devastating defeats suffered by Democrats in Congress, and he said that he would try to seek common ground with Republicans on issues like welfare reform.


Dr. Fell's Election
Tuesday's vote produced a political upheaval of historic proportions.
It decimated the top ranks of the Democratic Congressional leadership, awarded the Republicans control of both houses of Congress and most of the big-state governorships, and confronted President Clinton, who was elected as a minority President, with a stark problem of political survival.
Whether he can get any legislation passed and whether he is re-electable now depend largely on the strategic calculations of the likely Republican leaders, Representative Newt Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole, and such obstreperous ideologues as Senator Phil Gramm.
In the aftermath of a calamity that even the Cassandras among them had not predicted, disconsolate Democrats began to ask whether their party was flying apart like a disintegrating galaxy and losing any identity with which American voters could connect.
Republicans, in the aftermath of a triumph that fulfilled their rosiest fantasies, are left to wonder whether they can -- or want to -- shift from opposition to governance.

LIV ULLMANN, the luminescent Norwegian actress turned director and screenwriter, has returned to her homeland to receive one of its highest honors.
She is to be formally named a Commander of Olav by King Harald of Norway in a ceremony tomorrow in Oslo.
"I love my country, and it is very good to get such beautiful recognition from your country and your king," she said yesterday.
The honor, comparable to a British knighthood, is not the only good news to come Ms.
Ullmann's way recently.
More came from INGMAR BERGMAN, with whom she lived for many years.

Losers in Congress Can't Pack Up Just Yet
The House and Senate Democratic incumbents who lost on Tuesday or who have already announced their intention to leave Congress cannot go into retirement quite yet.
They have been asked by the White House to return to Washington in less than a month to consider one final measure, the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs.
It will be the first lame-duck session in 12 years, called by President Clinton to finish the last piece of his 1993-94 legislative agenda.

Brazil Ponders a Once-Unspeakable Subject: Taxing the Rich
With their Paris townhouses, lavish weddings and squads of servants, Brazil's super rich customarily find their photos in the society pages.
This week, a dozen multimillionaires opened Veja magazine to find their portraits illustrating an article on income tax evasion.
Studying files leaked by the tax authorities, the newsweekly calculated that Brazil's 460 wealthiest millionaires paid $32.5 million in income tax in 1992 -- barely one percent of their $26.7 billion in assets.
Totaled, their assets were equal to the combined gross national products of two of Brazil's largest neighbors, Peru and Bolivia.

"The lesbian brain is divided into three sections, as opposed to the sub-division into two sections of the normal brain," declares Eleanor, a self-described "feminist, archeologist, historian and bilingual student of the female brain," in Claire Chafee's comedy, "Why We Have a Body." Those three sections are "memory, lust and hammering doubt."


THE 1994 ELECTIONS: CONGRESS -- NEWS ANALYSIS How Lasting a Majority?; Despite Sweeping Gains for Republicans, History Suggests the Power Is Temporary
Everything in Washington is changed by Tuesday's Republican sweep.
The question is for how long.
With the Republicans in control of the Senate and the House of Representatives for the first time since 1954, when the Dodgers were still in Brooklyn and a postage stamp cost three cents, and with the Republicans in control of the statehouses in seven of the eight largest states, it is evident that a power shift of major proportions has taken place.
But is the transformation permanent?

Bonds Gain Despite Rate Threat
Prices of Treasury securities were higher yesterday for the second consecutive session on a stronger dollar and optimism that Republican gains would help the fixed-income market.
Prices of United States securities started rising overnight as European investors interpreted the election results to mean that Republicans would provide a more favorable environment for the financial markets.


Market Place; Union Pacific Shuffles Deck, Playing New Santa Fe Card
When the election campaign is going badly, change the rules.
That option, unavailable to the Democrats, was seized on election night by the Union Pacific Corporation, which appeared to be all but certain to lose the pending election for control of the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation.
Union Pacific's latest bid in the contest with Burlington Northern Inc. for railroad supremacy in the West offered to assume all risk that Federal regulators would turn the merger down.
It is willing, it said on Tuesday night, to pay for Santa Fe shares now and, if forced to do so, dispose of them later.
Santa Fe shareholders would face no risk.
But -- and this is where this election battle gets complex -- Union Pacific is also willing to pay a higher price if it doesn't have to bear that risk.
And while it initiated its tender offer last night, it imposed conditions that mean it could withdraw the offer.
It is at least possible that Santa Fe shareholders who will vote next week on the Burlington Northern offer could turn it down and then not be able to get anything from Union Pacific for years, if at all.
That risk obviously was not on the minds of traders yesterday who bid up Santa Fe shares, which rose $1.25, to $16, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Union Pacific fell $2 a share, to $47.50, while Burlington Northern, after rising early, ended unchanged at $49.375.
The market clearly thinks that Union Pacific will likely prevail with its new offer.
And it suspects it is overpaying.
Burlington Northern denounced the new Union Pacific offer, but said nothing to rule in or out the possibility of improving its own bid.
"In an effort to avoid an effective competitor, U.P. has now put its shareholders in a risky and vulnerable position," Gerald Grinstein, Burlington's chairman and chief executive, said.
The unusually complex takeover fight for Santa Fe reflects the fact that approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission is needed before the railroads can merge.
But there is nothing to stop one company from buying the other before the commission acts.
The mechanism for doing that is the voting trust, in which the railroads are kept separate even while under common ownership.
That is what Union Pacific proposed on Tuesday.
If the merger eventually is viewed as anticompetitive, Union Pacific would then have to dispose of Santa Fe, perhaps taking a sizable loss.
Santa Fe shareholders will vote Nov. 18 on the Burlington Northern offer of Burlington stock now valued at $16.79 a share.
That offer cannot be completed without the commission's approval, but Santa Fe officials believe that approval would be forthcoming.
They say a Union Pacific takeover would present a much more difficult hurdle because of the higher number of parallel routes that would be combined.
Prior to Tuesday night, Union Pacific had offered $20 a share in Union Pacific stock, contingent on shareholders rejecting the Burlington deal.
Union Pacific had rejected a voting trust proposal, instead citing its own experts who argued that the commission would approve a deal.
Effectively, Santa Fe's institutional holders said they did not want to take the chance, and suggested that Union Pacific put its money where its mouth was.
At first glance, that appears to be exactly what Union Pacific has done.
It is now offering $17.50 in cash and stock for each Santa Fe share, but with a voting trust that will enable it to act without commission approval.
It is taking that plan to Santa Fe shareholders through a tender offer.
But Union Pacific has left itself some escape clauses.
Though the tender offer goes directly to the shareholders, it is contingent on approval of the Santa Fe board, as well as on shareholder rejection of the Burlington Northern offer.
Why make a hostile offer contingent on board approval?
"We need their cooperation with the I.C.C.," said Gary Schuster, a spokesman for Union Pacific.
"We can waive that if we want to, but we probably won't."
Moreover, even in saying it would go to the shareholders, Union Pacific said it remained ready to make a deal on its previous terms, which offer more money but shift the risk of the commission's disapproval to Santa Fe shareholders, who would have to wait, perhaps for years, to see any cash.
The move by Union Pacific clearly shows it is determined to break up the marriage of two rivals.
But it has left itself enough wiggle room that shareholders who vote against the Burlington deal cannot be sure that a better deal will be quickly available.

As Washington's Old Order Gives Way, No Clear Signs From the New
For American business, the immediate post-election impact from the Republican Party victories is the new faces coming to the fore in Washington as committee chairmanships change hands.
Even so, the shift in control may not result in radical departures from current Congressional policies.
Here is a look at several leading industries most likely to be at the top of the agenda next year:

Mr.

Many Blacks See Betrayal In This Year's Campaign
The defeat of the Democrats was a bittersweet loss for many blacks, long considered the most loyal of Democratic voters.
It came after a campaign that left many saying they felt they were the underlying issue, where talk of welfare overhaul and the death penalty seemed aimed at them and where both parties seemed to compete to be the toughest on those topics.
"Race was at the heart of this election," said Roger Wilkins, a professor of history at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.
"There is a fierce anti-black and anti-immigrant undertone to this switch to the Republican Party. The message was, 'Let us take this country back and make it a white country -- a white male country -- again.' "


Corrections
A sports article on Tuesday about the Ice Wars figure skating competition between a team representing the United States and an international squad misstated the nationality of the skaters Viktor Petrenko and Oksana Baiul.

CLASSICAL MUSIC
New Singers Step Into Roles In the Met's 'Rigoletto'  Metropolitan Opera
Verdi was well-served by the new principals who joined the Metropolitan Opera cast on Tuesday evening for the company's 500th performance of "Rigoletto." Alfredo Kraus was an uncommonly suave Duke, who moved among his cavorting courtiers in the opening scene with a relaxed, proprietary air.
At 67, Mr.
Kraus remains in superb vocal shape.
Resisting the temptation to turn "Questa o quella" and "La donna e mobile" into mere crowd-pleasers, he showed how elegance can be as virtuosic as bravura singing and often more communicative.

Others on the losing side in this election should follow her example and take a reality check.
The world didn't end, the news isn't all bad, and, in any case, yesterday was the first day of the rest of the next campaign.
Herewith a determined look at the election's bright side by one voter who woke up the morning after feeling more intrigued than despondent about the G.O.P.'s Brave New World.


G.O.P. CELEBRATES ITS SWEEP TO POWER; CLINTON VOWS TO FIND COMMON GROUND
Republicans today declared a political revolution, promised to balance the Federal budget and generally reveled in winning control of both the House and the Senate for the first time in 40 years.

City Hospitals Avoid Layoffs And Make Severance Offers
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that the agency that operates New York City's municipal hospitals would offer voluntary severance packages to cut more than 2,500 workers from its payroll, rather than resorting to layoffs, as first proposed.
Less than two months ago, the president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, Dr.
Bruce Siegel, said that the agency would lay off 3,000 workers and eliminate hundreds of beds in the city's 11 hospitals as part of a plan to close a $356 million gap in the agency's $3.6 billion budget.

CBS Hopes to Cash In On a Sport for the Elite
There was a memorable photograph of a figure skating judge during the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics.
He was not hypnotized by the dazzling athleticism and artistry of Katarina Witt and Scott Hamilton, the gold medalists.
He was judging the dreary compulsory figures, endless repetitions of the figure 8.
He was sound asleep.
Now, compulsory events are skated by beginners only.
The elite skaters still dazzle, and, as one of them, Paul Wylie, said, "Figure skating has become a mainstream sport overnight." And there seems no end to its growth as more and more skating engulfs more and more television hours and arena dates.


Roving the Boroughs With Rover
"IT'S possible to own a dog in New York and still have a life," said Martha Kaplan, a writer for The New Yorker and mother to Clara, an animal-shelter mutt "who looks like a basenji on growth hormones."
Ms.
Kaplan's guide to enjoying the boroughs with Fido in tow, "The New York Dog Owner's Guide" (City &amp; Company, $9.95), offers the sort of information that can take months to learn by word of mouth: where to find dog runs, adoption agencies, ordinances, cemeteries and veterinarians, as well as stores that welcome shoppers with canine companions (among them, B. Dalton and Bloomingdale's).


Orthodox Rabbi Found Guilty Of Kidnapping a Jewish Youth
Rabbi Shlomo Helbrans, the leader of a small Hasidic sect in Brooklyn, was convicted yesterday of kidnapping a Jewish teenager who disappeared from his family for two years and became the center of an emotionally charged battle between the worlds of secular and ultra-Orthodox Jewry.
The rabbi's wife, who collapsed sobbing in the courtroom after her husband was taken away to jail, was acquitted of the kidnapping charge but convicted of criminal conspiracy in the case.


A Loner Is in Federated's Hot Seat
With the merger of Federated Department Stores Inc. and R. H. Macy &amp; Company roughly one month away, the task of melding two fiercely independent armies of merchants who have spent the last 65 years as bitter rivals has fallen to a little-known department store executive.
He is Terry J. Lundgren, Federated's 42-year-old chief merchant, and the changes he has made at Federated since he arrived in April comprise the blueprint for how he intends to meet his challenge.

Weicker Reflects on His Independent Party's Brief Heyday and Rapid Fall
By late Tuesday night, Gov.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. could read the portents: His independent third party, founded four years ago with the fanfare of a new political dynasty, had been consigned to the minor-party fringe.
His biggest achievement in office, the overhaul of the fiscal system in 1991 and the adoption of an income tax, would now be under siege by Governor-elect John G. Rowland, a man whom Mr.
Weicker has long reviled and who campaigned on a promise to undo Mr.
Weicker's fiscal accomplishments.

Tyson Halts Appeal
MIKE TYSON has quietly withdrawn his request for an appeal hearing on his 1992 rape conviction.
The decision means the former heavyweight boxing champion will serve the remaining months of his six-year term.
He is eligible for release next May.
Indianapolis Superior Court Judge PATRICIA GIFFORD, who presided over the trial, had scheduled a September hearing on a second round of appeals.
That hearing was delayed at Tyson's request until Nov. 14.
But in a motion granted last month, Tyson asked that the hearing be canceled, court officials said.

South
ALABAMA
The last time Fob James Jr. was Governor of Alabama, from 1979 to 1983, he was a Democrat.
But Mr.
James, 60, switched party affiliations for this year's race and rode the Republican tidal wave to an upset victory over Gov.
James E. Folsom Jr.
Mr.
Folsom, 45, a former Lieutenant Governor, became Governor last year after Gov.
Guy Hunt, a Republican, was convicted of ethics violations.
Democrats were counting on Mr.
Folsom to act as a bulwark against the strong anti-incumbent sentiment in the Deep South, and he held a steady lead over Mr.
James in the polls as recently as last week.

Another Epic, With 4 Plays in 6 Hours
"Angels in America" and, long before it, "Nicholas Nickleby" did a lot to popularize the theatrical epic, those gargantuan plays that require two nights (or a full day) to see in their entirety.
But after "Floating Islands," Eduardo Machado's bid to join the big leagues, you can only wonder why anyone would ever consent to spending that much time in a theater.
A chronicle of two 20th-century Cuban families that eventually find their way to the United States, it spans some 50 years, involves more than two dozen characters and takes six hours to unfold.
Mounted here by the Mark Taper Forum, which also served as a crucible for "Angels," the two-part production (each part consists of two plays) has been widely anticipated as one of the more ambitious offerings this season in the nation's nonprofit theaters.


Blake Has the Cincinnati Fans Up and Roaring
Jeff Blake has been taking his newly found success in stride, but it has been awfully hard.
He went from a Jets castoff to the Bengals' No. 3 quarterback in the off season.
And in three weeks, he has gone from the No. 3 quarterback to Cincinnati's savior.
After guiding the Bengals to their first victory of the season last Sunday -- a 20-17 overtime victory against the Seattle Seahawks -- Blake has become a cause celebre.
His telephone hasn't stopped ringing and he has been deluged by the national news media for interviews.

Delta's Terminals at Kennedy to Be Fixed
Kennedy International Airport, always crowded but rarely popular, will get an infusion of $150 million to fix up the Delta Air Lines terminals, the Port Authority announced yesterday.
The money is part of a projected $5 billion in improvements planned for the next few years to deal with the obvious decay in terminal buildings as well as less visible problems, like deteriorating sewers and roofs.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey signed a 25-year lease with Delta yesterday on the Delta Flight Center and Terminal 1A, both of which Delta took over when it acquired Pan Am's North Atlantic routes in 1991.
Of the $150 million in work that the Port Authority will finance, Delta has already spent $45 million, officials said.
Gerald P. FitzGerald, the agency's deputy director of aviation, said it would collect the money back through rent.


E.P.A. Rules On Emission Are Delayed
A convoluted air pollution issue that will affect tens of millions of automobile buyers in the next few years, today appears certain to become even more complicated when the Environmental Protection Agency misses a deadline for deciding whether to impose California's strict rules on automobile emissions on 12 Eastern states and the District of Columbia.
The states, from Virginia to Maine, voted as a group in February to ask the environmental agency to impose the California rules on them as a group.
But the agency appears to be weeks away from a decision, because it wants to strike a compromise based on an idea offered by the three largest automobile manufacturers in the country.


Economic Scene; Putting a price tag on life, and regulation that protects it.
HOW much is a life worth? Merely posing the question offends most people.
But answer it they must and answer it they do, says Kip Viscusi, an economist at Duke University.
Every time the Government decrees a cleanup strategy for a toxic-waste dump or spends Medicaid dollars on kidney dialysis it is making implicit decisions about the dollars-and-cents value of life.
The hard part, Mr.
Viscusi suggests, is facing up to it.

An All-Too-Believable Dad Steps In for Saint Nick
It may be early for Christmas, but it's not too early for a clever, entertaining children's film with a realistic edge and a minimum of seasonal mush.
"The Santa Clause" easily transports Tim Allen from success on television (he is the star of "Home Improvement") to bright prospects on the big screen.
Behind Mr.
Allen's rubbery-faced amiability there lurks a welcome cynicism, one that serves him well in this fresh, cheerful story.
Mr.
Allen plays Scott Calvin, a divorced father who finds himself unexpectedly roped into a career of delivering presents and talking to reindeer, to the surprise and delight of his young son.
If Christmas is the film's nominal subject, its subtext is mending the wounds of divorce.
It deals with that issue in graceful, reassuring ways.


Corrections
A picture caption yesterday with an article about children serving in rebel military movements referred incorrectly to the role of children in the Zapatista organization in Mexico.
While some were trained by the rebels, the children were never reported to have fought with them.

In a continuing drop, shares of Discovery Zone Inc., an operator of children's recreation centers, fell sharply yesterday after a Paine Webber analyst lowered his stock recommendation.

Woman Can Be Buried Beside Husband
The feud between John Biango's wife and his sister began as he lay dying of cancer in 1990.
And it has persisted in and out of court since, with the sister, Dorothy Pagano, insisting that her brother's dying wish was that his wife, Christine, should never be buried next to him.
Today, a New Jersey judge resolved what he called a virulent and soap-operalike dispute with a stinging rebuke of the sister, describing her as a cold, calculating woman and dismissing her entire story as "a classic fraud."

A Simpler Test for Alzheimer's Is Reported
Researchers at Harvard Medical School believe they may have stumbled upon a simple test for Alzheimer's disease, one that can easily distinguish between those who have the devastating disorder, which relentlessly robs its victims of their minds, and those who do not.
The investigators, led by Dr.
Leonard F. M. Scinto, of the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard Medical School, and by Dr.
Huntington Potter, of Harvard Medical School, report that people with Alzheimer's appear to be exquisitely sensitive to eye drops similar to those that doctors use to dilate the pupils before performing an eye examination.


Asian Nations Wary on Free Trade
The nations of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which represent more than half the world's economic output, all say they agree in principle with President Clinton that the path to further prosperity is to lower ever more barriers to trade and investment.
But as leaders from the United States and the other 17 member countries gather here for a summit meeting, the notion of achieving even a vague commitment for a giant Pacific free-trade zone from Chile to China, even far in the future, has led to apprehension as well as expectation.


PRESIDENT ORDERS END TO ENFORCING BOSNIAN EMBARGO
Breaking with its European allies, the Clinton Administration has directed the United States military to stop enforcing the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government, beginning on Saturday.
Under the new approach, which has been sharply debated within the Administration, the United States Navy will not divert ships carrying arms to Bosnia or Croatia.

Legal Aid Managers Earn Their (Low) Pay
To the Editor:
How unfair to contrast the Legal Aid Society's "young, idealistic and low-paid attorneys" with "bureaucratic," "inefficient" middle managers (editorial, Nov. 4).
We are the same idealistic, low-paid lawyers we were when we attained "management" positions only after years of excelling as Legal Aid trial lawyers.


The Gods Transplanted To Texas
Camp, once largely the province of gay men and the women who loved them, has been sure-footedly working its way into the mainstream over the last several decades.
John Waters movies can be seen at local malls; "Twin Peaks" was, however briefly, a television hit, and aging starlets like Joan Collins have translated the sensibility into flourishing second careers.
A theatrical byproduct of this phenomenon has been a new breed of musical, at once nostalgic and ironic, that embraces what it purports to send up.
It dates back at least to the 1960's and "Little Mary Sunshine," reached a high point in 1982 with "Little Shop of Horrors" and has recently spawned a host of goofy, 1950's and 60's-style revues like "Forever Plaid" and "Beehive."


Copyright Law Covers Electronic Rights
To the Editor:
In "Writers Fight for Electronic Rights" (The Media Business, Nov. 7), addressing the question of who owns electronic rights, you discuss freelancers who might be pressured into signing contracts that grant "universal rights" to the publisher.

U.S. Makes Public Millions of Long-Secret Papers
President Clinton today signed an executive order declassifying nearly 44 million pages of long-secret documents, some dating to World War I, in an action delayed for nearly a year by the objections of military and intelligence officials.
The papers represent roughly an eighth of the secret documents held by the National Archives.
All have been classified on national security grounds until today.


Clinton Asks G.O.P. to Back Free Trade
President Clinton appealed today to the newly victorious Republicans to maintain their party's traditional support for free trade and approve a worldwide trade agreement in Congress, arguing that failure to do so would "jeopardize our leadership and our prosperity."
In a speech at Georgetown University Mr.
Clinton, clearly tired as he prepared to leave for Asia on Friday for an economic summit meeting, sounded frustrated that many Americans still suspected that his trade proposals will cost them jobs and cut their wages.


Reagan Revolution Redux
Tuesday's carnage was not, as many liberal pundits have claimed, a revolt of random wrath against incumbents.
The voters directed their fire at liberal Democrats, and set in motion the second stage of the Reagan Revolution, which will make the one-term Presidencies of George Bush and Bill Clinton seem like political hiccups.
The voters want Republicans to address specific problems, some of them spelled out in the "Contract With America," some of them brought to national attention by Ronald Reagan in 1980, some of them brand new.
Now the Republicans must make good on those promises or face another voter backlash in 1996.

After Big Victory, Sri Lankan Says She'll Resume Rebel Talks
After overwhelming her opponent in Sri Lanka's presidential election by a margin of more than two million votes, Prime Minister Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said today that she would resume talks with the Tamil Tigers rebels to try to end the country's 11-year-old civil war.
Mrs.
Kumaratunga, 49, became President-elect when results from elections held Wednesday showed she had 62 percent of the vote.
Her principal opponent, Srima Dissanayaka, won 35 percent.
Mrs.
Dissanayaka took over the United National Party candidacy from her husband, Gamini, who was killed with 54 others in a suicide bombing on Oct. 24.


New Chairman for a Changed Sears
It was perhaps one of Corporate America's most poignant changings of the guard.
Edward A. Brennan, the gracious merchant who like many of his predecessors had climbed his way up Sears's corporate ladder until he reached the chief executive's aerie atop the Sears Tower, yesterday moved to hand the baton to Arthur C. Martinez, an outsider he recruited about two years ago to turn around Sears's stores.


More Students Than Athletes, as the 44 Losses Prove
The day embraced all the essentials of a grand and glorious homecoming football game for small Prairie View A&amp;M.
The sun was shining brightly in southeastern Texas.
The halftime show featured Prairie View's renowned marching band, typically bold and brassy.
The stands of Blackshear Stadium were filled to capacity with 6,000 alumni, students and supporters.
But when the high-stepping band departed, when the Prairie View players in their gleaming gold helmets and purple jerseys returned to resume play, half the fans had already departed or were flocking to the aisles as though responding to an emergency call.
The score was 42-14 in favor of visiting Tarleton (Tex.) State, and the situation was about to get worse.


When in Rome, Beware of Pickpockets
To the Editor:
I've loved Rome from the first moment I saw it many years ago, and your Nov. 4 "Rome Journal: For the Long-Suffering Colosseum, Intensive Care" brought back a flood of memories and happy confirmation of the loving care and restoration already completed and in progress at my last visit in 1992.
The Trevi Fountain alone was breathtaking in its restored beauty, and everywhere one could see Rome emerging from the decay of centuries.


Right vs. Realities in Romania, 1925
To appreciate "An Unforgettable Summer," it helps to dismiss the mawkish, romance-novel title.
Set in Romania in 1925, the film begins with scenes of cosmopolitan decadence, jazz-age glamour and fierce political undercurrents.
On their way to a glittering, fancy-dress ball, Romanian army officers stop by a brothel, where they beat the women yelling antimilitary slogans at them.
Next, Kristin Scott-Thomas (the sophisticate from "Four Weddings and a Funeral") arrives at the ball.
She plays the beautiful, elegant Marie-Therese Von Debretsy Dumitriu, a woman with bobbed hair, diaphanous dresses and an unaccountably graceful smile.
As Marie-Therese dances, an elderly relative at the party describes her background.
Her wealthy father turned over his land to the Communists when the revolution approached, but was killed anyway, and Marie-Therese was saved from poverty by her marriage to Petre Dumitriu (Claudiu Bleont), a short, fussy officer with a monocle.
Raised in London, she speaks, as her relative points out, "perfect Romanian with a ghastly Oxford accent." Her life is soon to change again, but her elegance never leaves her or this evocative film by Lucian Pintilie.
Like its heroine, the film's serene and beautiful appearance masks a powerful conscience.

Parolee Charged In 12 Robberies Of Customers At A.T.M. Sites
Seized after a wild, crash-punctuated car chase by investigators who linked disparate clues and patiently staked out his stolen vehicle, a paroled holdup man was charged yesterday with 12 robberies in five days in which patrons were terrorized by a gunman at automated teller machines in Queens.
Detectives said the suspect, Vernon Lennon, 26, of Brooklyn, was identified in lineups by victims in all 12 robberies, which netted $3,000 between last Friday and Tuesday at teller machines in Flushing, Fresh Meadows, Woodhaven and Ozone Park.
They said he was suspected in as many as 25 robberies at cash machines in Queens over the last two months.


Sports of The Times; Ewing Ought To Plead No Contest
THE young giant is scary, and just getting started.
Shaquille O'Neal has a turnaround jump shot now, a reliable baby hook, and, of course, he is almost impossible to keep away from the rim for too long.
One night after dropping 46 points on Alonzo Mourning in Charlotte, O'Neal was all over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden last night for 41 more.
The Knicks won the game, 101-99, when O'Neal lost sight of Patrick Ewing in the confusion of the final seconds.
Ewing dropped in a pretty right baseline jumper, and danced victoriously downcourt.
He lost another personal confrontation with O'Neal, but his team won the war, and that is all that should matter to Ewing for as long as he competes at this level against O'Neal.

Why Do Male Athletes Assault Women? Research Begins
Somewhere between the West Point football gropers and the heavyweight rapist, Mike Tyson, may be a vast, troubling, uncharted area of sexual assault on women by male athletes, a kind of Bermuda Triangle of sports in which discussion mysteriously disappears.
Anecdotal evidence pops up several times a week, a paragraph or two here and there about another pro player beating his wife or a college team raping a drunken classmate, but rarely has an attempt been made to pull this information together to find out if there is a pattern of behavior.
Even the coverage of the murder trial of O. J. Simpson, which seems to have diagrammed every racial, sexual, class and economic X and O, seems so far to have avoided dealing with the possibility that football players, as surely as combat soldiers, have been programmed and rewarded for a kind of violence that can't always be turned off.


Restoring the Rails on Staten Island; Plans for Economic Revival Stretch Along 15 Miles of Track
To the people who live on the north shore of Staten Island, the abandoned railroad that cuts through their neighborhoods is an unsightly ruin where prostitutes and drug addicts hide.
It barely resembles the gleaming steel line that 40 years ago linked local factories to their markets and carried passengers to the amusements of South Beach.
But to New York City officials, the defunct Staten Island Railway -- a 15-mile stretch of overgrown, rusty tracks and ramshackle stations -- is essential to revitalizing the area's stagnant economy and could provide an alternate freight route that would reduce pollution from trucks.

Green Isn't One to Mince His Words or Opinions
Dallas Green has never had much sympathy for drug abusers.
He has always held athletes to a higher standard than the average man on the street.
So it comes as no surprise that Green has no desire to see Dwight Gooden back in a Mets uniform when he completes his one-year suspension.
Green yesterday reiterated the stand he had taken nearly two months ago, when it was revealed that Gooden had failed a third and fourth drug test.
Then, Green said that it was "time for Doc to go elsewhere." He has not changed his mind.


Justice Breyer Severs Ties To the Lloyd's Syndicate
Justice Stephen G. Breyer of the Supreme Court has apparently extricated himself, at a hefty price, from an investment in a London insurance syndicate that led to strong criticism during his confirmation hearings last summer.
According to a letter dated Nov. 9 from a senior executive of Lloyd's of London, Justice Breyer is no longer a member of Lloyd's.
The investment led to questions from senators about whether he had been insensitive to conflicts of interest during his tenure as a Federal appeals court judge.
During his time as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, Justice Breyer participated in eight cases concerning pollution.
At the same time he was an investor in a Lloyd's syndicate that faced heavy losses from pollution suits.


Bobby McFerrin's Lively Learning Process
Bobby McFerrin's gentle ditty "Don't Worry, Be Happy" must seem a perverse taunt to American orchestra executives, whose incessant lament over looming deficits and declining audiences would strike the Ancient Mariner dumb.
But could Mr.

The St.
Paul Chamber Orchestra is banking on it.
The group performed on Wednesday evening at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis with Mr.
McFerrin conducting (to say the least) for the first time since he took over its "creative chair" this fall.

Both are graduate students at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, which administers the scholarships for its students from funds donated by the cosmetics industry.


Nets' Shots Go Swish And Beard Wins No. 1
Now that the Nets have lent a sense of legitimacy to their fledgling campaign, new questions arise for Coach Butch Beard and his suddenly giddy team.

Can the defense that punctuated their 110-109 victory over Chicago at the Meadowlands on Wednesday be parlayed into Friday night's game against the Washington Bullets at the USAir Arena?
And what of those arcing jumpers that kept finding the bottom of the net after shooting 36 percent during a three-game Texas tour -- are they aberrations or learned behavior?


New Majority's Agenda: Substantial Changes May Be Ahead
When Republicans take control of the Senate and House in January, they will propose a legislative agenda drastically different from President Clinton's, which could lead to substantial changes in a broad array of Federal programs and laws, as well as the workings of Congress.
Following are brief looks at the main issues.
GOVERNMENT
Republicans taking control of Congress say they want to make numerous changes in government procedures and operations, including the rules of the House.


S.E.C. Issues Municipal Bond Rules
After more than a year of discussion, compromise and negotiation, the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted new rules yesterday to bring the municipal bond market into the modern age.
The rules will provide investors with annual reports from municipalities -- just like corporate reports -- and make it easier for investors to get bond prices.
The changes are expected to have a profound effect on the $1.2 trillion municipal bond market, where the nation's cities and towns raise money.
Once in place, the rules could encourage more investors to buy municipal bonds, lower the borrowing costs to municipalities and save taxpayer dollars.


Art in Review
Inge Morath
Spanish Institute  684 Park Avenue (at 68th Street)  Through Nov. 29
Inge Morath's black-and-white photographs of Spain in the 1950's offer a timeless view of that country.
Surprisingly, there is little sense of either the political turmoil of the 1930's or the industrial and democratic state that Spain has become.


Temerlin Gets A L'Eggs Account
The L'Eggs Products division of the Sara Lee Corporation in Winston-Salem, N.C., said yesterday that it had named Temerlin McClain in Irving, Tex., to handle advertising for its Just My Size brand, previously at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising in New York.
Billings were estimated at $6 million to $10 million.


4 Teen-Agers Indicted in Death of Ecuadorean Immigrant
Their lawyers say they all come from solid middle-class families.
Three are high school students -- one an honor student -- and one works in his family's funeral home.
They have no previous criminal records.
But the four teen-agers are in serious trouble now -- indicted yesterday on murder charges in what the Brooklyn District Attorney called the savage, bias-related slaying of a homeless Ecuadorean immigrant who was fatally beaten by a band of youths in a Brooklyn park on Sept. 6.

3 Boys Held in Robbery of Off-Duty Officer
Three teen-age boys were arrested and charged with robbing an off-duty police sergeant and two other men on Staten Island yesterday, the police said.
One of the boys, a 13-year-old whose name was not released because of his age, was also charged with attempted murder after he fired two shots at the victims' car when the men gave chase, said a police spokeswoman, Detective Mary Ann Mullin.
The other assailants, one 12 and the other 14, were charged with robbery.

No Execution For Suspect In Shootings, Judge Says
Colin Ferguson, charged with killing six people on a Long Island Rail Road train, sought -- and received -- reassurance from a judge today that he would not face execution even if he is found guilty and Governor-elect George E. Pataki signs the death penalty into law.
"Your honor, will you please assure my client that he is not under the threat of a death sentence," his lawyer, William M. Kunstler, said at a pretrial hearing.


Fighter Is Indicted
A Federal grand jury in Miami returned a drug indictment against the featherweight boxer RUBEN PALACIO of Colombia, who last year became the first boxing champion to test positive for the virus that causes AIDS.
Palacio was arrested Sunday at Miami International Airport with 5.33 pounds of heroin concealed in the lining of his coat and his undershorts, authorities said.


Corrections
A brief report in the state-by-state election summary yesterday and on Wednesday about the results in Alaska misidentified Tony Knowles, a candidate for Governor.
He was the Democratic challenger; the current Governor is Walter J. Hickel.
The outcome of the race remains undecided.
Mr.
Knowles holds a slight lead over his Republican opponent, Jim Campbell, but absentee ballots remain to be counted.

High Anxiety Raises Risk of Heart Failure in Men, Study Finds
Men who complain of high anxiety are four to six times more likely to die from sudden heart failure than other men, Harvard researchers say.
And the risk of sudden cardiac death from anxiety is two to three times greater than that related to cigarette smoking, said Dr.
Ichiro Kawachi, an assistant professor of health and social behavior at the Harvard School of Public Health in Cambridge, Mass.
Cigarette smoking is considered one of the strongest risk factors for heart disease.

Getting Serious on Bosnian Arms
Prodded by Congress, the Clinton Administration is now asking the United Nations Security Council to lift its unjust arms embargo against Bosnia and has announced that American military forces will stop enforcing that embargo tomorrow.
Lifting the embargo is the right policy and the fairest, surest path to an honorable and stable peace.
For years, Washington has been saying that it favors lifting the embargo.
But it has never deployed the full diplomatic weight of the United States to get it lifted.
Doing so would mean standing up to European countries like Britain, France and Russia that prefer to keep the Bosnians disarmed and impose an internationally brokered partition plan.
Instead of trying to win over the Europeans, the Administration has repeatedly backed off the issue.
But perhaps there will be a more whole-hearted effort this time.

Broadening of Arbitrations Advances in New Jersey
The New Jersey Senate today passed a bill aimed at turning contract disputes between municipalities and their police officers and firefighters into an exercise in compromise rather than a game of winner take all.
Under the current law, when dealing with an impasse in negotiations an arbitrator must side either with the town or with the unions, rather than seeking middle ground.

After Killing, Irish Halt I.R.A. Release Plan
The Irish Government withdrew its plans for the early release of Irish Republican Army prisoners today, hours after a postal worker in Northern Ireland was shot dead by men suspected of being I.R.A. guerrillas.
The attack was the first violent killing in the British province of Ulster since the I.R.A. cease-fire began on Sept. 1.
Protestant paramilitaries began a cease-fire on Oct. 14.


Moss, Wisconsin Star, Suspended After Arrest
BRENT MOSS, a star Wisconsin fullback and the most valuable player in the last Rose Bowl, was suspended from the team yesterday after his arrest on a drug charge, the university said.

N.H.L. Union Awaits Response After Offering a Concession
Two months ago, before the beginning of the six-week-old National Hockey League lockout, a top league executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told how the players could signal that they were ready to make a deal.
The key, the executive said, was for the players to offer a concession on an entry-level salary structure for rookies.
If the players would do this, the executive said, the owners would be willing to compromise on other major issues and a new collective bargaining agreement could be reached.

Spurious Sequel? Well, Fiddledeedee
"Ah doan know nuthin' 'bout birthin' babies!" the hysterical maid screamed at Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone With the Wind." Maybe the poor girl didn't.
But the Margaret Mitchell estate sure does, especially million-dollar babies with 5-and-10-cent entertainment possibilities.
Blessed by the author's heirs, Alexandra Ripley was recruited to continue the Mitchell tale in "Scarlett." That 1991 best seller has been adapted by William Hanley for a CBS mini-series, which, beginning on Sunday and picking up on Tuesday, runs for eight hours over four nights.
And even as we ponder the mysteries of modern show business, yet another sequel novel is already being prepared for computer processing.

For the 49ers, Being in the Hunt Is Simply Not Good Enough
They met at a charity event in Youngstown, Ohio, in 1968, and the chatter flowed so easily.
For Carmen Policy and Edward DeBartolo Jr., the roots were strong.
Both grew up in Youngstown.
Both had grandparents who lived in villages in Italy only 11 miles apart.
And both possessed an insatiable desire to succeed. To win.


Abroad at Home; Anger And Reality
Newt Gingrich was brilliant at playing to the resentment of Americans.
Brilliant and nasty.
But those of us who disliked his tactics must not let that shut our eyes to the fact that the resentment is there.
It is resentment of what many Americans see as an arrogant ruling class, out of touch with their concerns.
What are the reasons for the extraordinary anger, directed at incumbent Democrats right across the country?
I believe it is first of all a matter of economics.

Clinton Picks New Director of AIDS Policy
President Clinton today named Patricia S. Fleming, a former assistant to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to be White House director of AIDS policy.
She succeeds Kristine M. Gebbie, who resigned after 11 months, saying that people expected too much from her as the Government's "AIDS czar."

U.S. Changes Stance in Case On Obscenity
Stung by Congressional criticism of its legal interpretation of a child-pornography law, the Clinton Administration reversed course in a brief filed with the Supreme Court today and disavowed its previous position that the law applied only to depictions of nude children.
The filing of the brief, as well as a statement accompanying it, disclosed an unusual fissure in the top ranks of the Justice Department.
The brief was signed by Attorney General Janet Reno and not by Solicitor General Drew S. Days 3d, the Government's top Supreme Court advocate, whose narrower view of the child-pornography law, as expressed in a brief last year, unleashed a storm of criticism on Capitol Hill.


New Majority's Agenda: Substantial Changes May Be Ahead
When Republicans take control of the Senate and House in January, they will propose a legislative agenda drastically different from President Clinton's, which could lead to substantial changes in a broad array of Federal programs and laws, as well as the workings of Congress.
Following are brief looks at the main issues.
FOREIGN POLICY
With Jesse Helms of North Carolina in line to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Republican majority in Congress is expected to push to cut foreign aid as well as money for the U.N.
Republican lawmakers also say they will require a Congressional vote before the United States contributes troops or money to any U.N. peacekeeping mission.


IRAQIS TO ACCEPT KUWAIT'S BORDERS
Iraq said today that it would recognize the independence and current borders of Kuwait, a major step apparently intended to allow at least some United Nations sanctions against Baghdad to be lifted.
A declaration of the Revolutionary Command Council, signed by President Saddam Hussein, said Iraq accepted the "sovereignty of the State of Kuwait, its territorial integrity and political independence." The recognition, more than four years after Iraq invaded Kuwait and provoked the Persian Gulf war, was also approved by the Iraqi Parliament and is to be published in the Government's gazette, as required by United Nations resolutions.


New York, Shown at Its Best Through a Hero at His Worst
"Manhattan by Numbers" was shown as part of the 1993 New Directors/New Films series.
Following are excerpts from Vincent Canby's review, which appeared in The New York Times on April 2, 1993.
The film opens today at the Quad Cinema, 13th Street west of Fifth Avenue, Greenwich Village.
Amir Naderi's "Manhattan by Numbers" is a quite beautiful if uninvolving exercise in urban alienation, prettily shot against a variety of photogenic New York locations.


But Just Who Spoke on Election Day?; Death Penalty Boycott
To the Editor:
The United States election results will affect no one so much as those on New York State's death row.
As soon as the first person is executed in New York, I will boycott the state, viewing it in a similar light to countries that continue to think that the government has the right to execute its own population as punishment.


Coke Adds to Operations Of Fruitopia Drink Unit
Intensifying the fruit-drink wars in one of the fastest-growing beverage categories, the Coca-Cola Company announced yesterday that it had invested $150 million to expand production of its Fruitopia beverage division and would introduce a new lower-calorie line of Fruitopia flavors as well.
The investment has been used to purchase plants in Waco, Tex., and Northampton, Mass., the company said, and to upgrade the bottling lines in existing operations.


Defections Among Men to G.O.P. Helped Insure Rout of Democrats
Large numbers of men abandoned Democratic candidates in Tuesday's elections, a trend that gave Republicans an edge in races around the nation and one that Democratic leaders fear might be hard to reverse.
The overwhelming advantage that men gave Republicans touched races all over the country.
For example, in Senate races in Michigan and Tennessee, where Republicans picked up open seats that had been held by Democrats, 61 percent of the men voted for the Republicans.

La-Z-Boy Account Goes to Doner
The La-Z-Boy Chair Company of Monroe, Mich., said yesterday that it had selected W. B. Doner &amp; Company in Southfield, Mich., to handle its national brand account, which had been at Ross Roy Communications in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., for the last 14 years.
While billings on the account have ranged from $6 million to $8 million, the company said it planned to increase spending in 1995 to $10 million to $12 million.
Doner, which already handles retail advertising for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries retail chain, was awarded the account after a six-month review that was narrowed to Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis, DDB Needham Chicago and Doner.
The assignment brings Doner's total La-Z-Boy billings to an estimated $20 million.


A Victory for Public Justice
The issue in the Supreme Court case the other day was technical and arcane: Can a losing party, appealing a decision to a higher Federal court, settle out of court with the other side and have the adverse decision erased from the lawbooks?
Hardly the stuff of legal legend, yet the Court's handling of the question constitutes a significant boost for public justice.
No, said Justice Antonin Scalia for a unanimous Court, a losing party may not get the courts to withdraw a decision just because the contestants no longer disagree.
Judicial precedents "are not merely the property of private litigants," he said, quoting an opinion of Justice John Paul Stevens.

Pension Liabilities May Lead To Charge at Westinghouse
The Westinghouse Electric Corporation may take a pretax charge of $200 million to $250 million against its fourth-quarter earnings, as workers retiring or being laid off under its restructuring program withdraw money from the company's pension plan.
But the noncash charge, disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, would be taken only if so-called lump-sum distributions topped a threshold that has not yet been reached, company officials said last night.

Law Firm's Removal Is Urged Again
The Federal official overseeing the bankruptcy case of the Leslie Fay Companies reiterated his recommendation yesterday that the law firm of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges be removed from the case and be forced to forfeit a large portion of $5.3 million in fees it has billed in the case.
In a rebuttal to Weil, Gotshal's response to his earlier motion calling for the firm's disqualification, Arthur J. Gonzalez, the United States Trustee for New York, wrote that "Weil, Gotshal failed to adequately respond to -- and in certain instances completely ignored -- the critical issues raised in the motion."


Boycott Threatened
JOSE SULAIMAN, the president of the World Boxing Council, threatened yesterday to lead a Mexican boycott of fights in California to protest a new law that would deny social services to undocumented immigrants in the state.
At a news conference in Mexico City to promote five title fights to be held there on Saturday night, Sulaiman criticized the passage of Proposition 187, calling it "discriminatory, inhumane and totally racist."

The paintings in Robert Berlind's lovely solo show depict the gently agitated surfaces of creeks or streams and their reflected landscapes, each of which suggests a time of year: bare trees and a milky winter sun in one case, russet autumn foliage in another.
In "Calicoon Creek," the water is an edge-to-edge web of sky blue dotted with a few bright yellow floating leaves, and in "Shallow Bottom," the stones lying on a creek bed are visible through drifts of white foam.


Bausch &amp; Lomb Chooses Bozell
Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. of Rochester said yesterday that it had selected Bozell New York to handle advertising for its Curel and Soft Sense skin-care products, which had been handled by Margeotes Fertitta Donaher &amp; Weiss in New York since June 1993.
Billings were estimated at $10 million to $12 million.
Bozell was awarded the account after a eight-month review that was narrowed to Bozell and two other New York shops, Lowe &amp; Partners/SMS and Warwick Baker &amp; Fiore.

The boys, ages 12 to 18, were needed for questioning about a street demonstration, the soldiers said.
They promised to bring them home.

"It's the uncle who bears the responsibility for the homicide."

The unanswered question on Whitewater is not whether the Republicans will hold hearings -- there is no doubt they will -- but how broad those hearings will be and whether the lawmakers will yield to the Republican special prosecutor.


Pataki Says Thank You In Happy Visit To Upstaters
A weary but joyful Governor-elect George E. Pataki delivered a thank-you letter today to the upstate voters who supported him overwhelmingly in Tuesday's election, hop-skipping through four northern cities that he had frequented like weekend homes in the campaign's final days.
At each of his stops, which included Rochester, Syracuse, Buffalo and Albany, Mr.
Pataki took off his suit coat and strode into crowds, bear-hugging acquaintances, signing photographs and promising not to forget his supporters once he was ensconced in the "insulated environment" of the Statehouse.

Producer Prices Fell Last Month
Producer prices dropped by five-tenths of 1 percent in October for the second consecutive month, the Labor Department reported yesterday, providing more evidence that inflation remained mild despite strong economic growth for more than a year.
More than anything else, car prices pulled down the Producer Price Index in October.
The index measures the prices charged for finished goods as they leave factories, mills and refineries ready for use and are sold to wholesalers, retailers, auto dealers and others.

Rapture and Terror, Bound by Blood
EROTICISM bubbles beneath the surface of every vampire story, but Anne Rice is a writer to make the pot boil.
Ms.
Rice's hothouse blend of pretension, swooning seduction and avidly sensual horror has brought strikingly contemporary nuances to the vampire genre, infusing it with the literary equivalent of new blood.
Her dense, suffocating novels have done as much to plumb old mysteries of the occult as to create new ones atop the best-seller list -- but that's another story.
Ms.
Rice once insisted publicly that her heady brew could not possibly be captured on film, at least not in a film directed by Neil Jordan and starring a noted nonvampire like Tom Cruise.
Now rightfully eating her hat over such pronouncements, she ought to be the most appreciative viewer that Mr.
Jordan's "Interview With the Vampire" has.
His sumptuous film is as strange and mesmerizing as it is imaginatively ghastly.
It's a sophisticated, spookily intense rendering of Ms.
Rice's story.


Bosnia Army Said to Shell Its Own Area
Releasing a crater analysis of a shell that exploded here on Tuesday, wounding a child, United Nations military officials today gave what appeared to be the first compelling evidence that the mostly Muslim Bosnian Army carried out a mortar attack on a Sarajevo neighborhood under its control.
A United Nations crater analysis of another mortar shell that killed two children about two hours earlier on Tuesday, however, showed it was fired from a position under the control of the Bosnian Serbs, who have renewed artillery attacks on densely populated city neighborhoods in response to Bosnian Army offensives elsewhere.

Greyhound, the remaining coast-to-coast bus network, missed a $4.3 million bond payment due Sept. 30.
Talks that began earlier in September had, in recent days, turned into an exercise in brinksmanship.

In a move widely seen as strengthening his status as the heir apparent at Pepsico Inc., Roger A. Enrico, the company's second-ranking executive, was named yesterday to head a new unit that would oversee the international operations of its KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell fast-food restaurants.
Mr.
Enrico, the Pepsico vice chairman, will become chief executive of Pepsico Restaurants International, a new unit based in Dallas.
Analysts said his appointment and the creation of the new division were intended to increase Pepsico's international opportunities, as well as bolster the restaurant companies' disappointing performance in the United States and Canada.

Saying a Government finding of a safety defect in General Motors pickup trucks "threatens the entire automotive industry," the chief executives of the Big Three auto makers sent a joint letter to President Clinton today urging him to "address the intolerable state of regulatory uncertainty" that the pickup issue could create.

After 10 Years, Wrongful Death Trial Begins
With thunderous, incantatory accusations, a lawyer for the father of Libby Zion, whose nearly decade-old lawsuit against New York Hospital went to trial yesterday, blamed the 18-year-old woman's death not only on the hospital staff's "litany of errors," but on established medical training, which he said produced residents who were "inexperienced, unsupervised, overworked and sleep-deprived."
But the lawyer for New York Hospital and three doctors being sued said the attention given Ms.
Zion was "careful, not careless," and indicated that he would offer an all-out defense of postgraduate medical education, particularly as offered by Cornell Medical College, whose students do much of their clinical training at New York Hospital.
The residents, he said, had been well rested.

How far will powerful women travel to meet other powerful women?
Quite a distance, said GAEL GREENE, the restaurant critic, who has noticed increasing numbers of women from out of town and out of state making reservations for the eighth annual Citymeals-on-Wheels Power Lunch for Women.
This year, 340 women (and a dozen men) are expected to converge for lunch at the Rainbow Room on Monday.

Rodman Misses Drill
DENNIS RODMAN of the San Antonio Spurs missed practice yesterday, the day after his three-game suspension by the club was to have ended.


Corrections
An article on Oct. 23 about anti-incumbent sentiment in Congressional races in the New York region referred incorrectly to the Congressional service of members of the Hamilton Fish family.
It has not been continuous since 1922; a Hamilton Fish was elected in 1920 and represented the Hudson Valley area until 1944, and his son, Hamilton Fish Jr., held the seat from 1969 until this year.


G.O.P. May Drop New York From List
The chairman of the Republican National Committee said yesterday that he would recommend dropping New York City from the list of places the G.O.P. is considering for its 1996 convention.
The chairman, Haley Barbour, did not say that his recommendation was made in retaliation for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's decision to cross party lines and endorse Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat.
But Mr.
Barbour noted in a statement, "From the beginning we have said facilities, financing and politics are the three criteria."


Jet Defense Gets Physical, Gets Well
It was never the downfield hit that defined the Jets' defense.
It was the phenomenon of the Sack Exchange: a relentless, quarterback-chasing front four that became the darling of Madison Avenue in the 1980's.
These days, the Jets' defense has a more nasty image.
They'll attack anyone with the same ferocity that they would a quarterback.
And they revel in dishing out punishment.
Last Sunday the Jets sent wide receivers Andre Reed (knee) and Don Beebe (concussion) and tight end Vince Marrow (separated shoulder) to the sidelines and battered Jim Kelly (bruised rib) several times to the turf.


Suffolk Lawmakers Seek District Attorney Inquiry
The Suffolk County Legislature voted today to ask Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo to investigate allegations that District Attorney James M. Catterson Jr. abused his powers by threatening lawmakers and other county officials with grand-jury investigations.
The lawmakers voted 16 to 0, with one abstention, to ask the Governor to look into the allegations and, if necessary, to appoint a special prosecutor to determine whether Mr.
Catterson should be removed from office.


At Trenton State, Titles Up for Grabs
The defense is so efficient, the goalkeeper has nothing to do for long stretches of games.
And if the opposition happens to break through, Jeanne Bizzoco is there to deny anyone threatening the goal of the Trenton State field hockey team.
Bizzoco and the Lions are the only undefeated and untied field hockey team in Division III, which is staging its final four tournament this week.
Not only have the Lions scored 88 goals and allowed only 4 this season, but 14 of their 18 victories have also been shutouts.


New Majority's Agenda: Substantial Changes May Be Ahead
When Republicans take control of the Senate and House in January, they will propose a legislative agenda drastically different from President Clinton's, which could lead to substantial changes in a broad array of Federal programs and laws, as well as the workings of Congress.
Following are brief looks at the main issues.
THE MILITARY
Republicans are vowing to increase Pentagon spending, but competing priorities to cut taxes and reduce the deficit may leave President Clinton's military program relatively unchanged.

Bond Prices Decline After Early Rally
Prices of Treasury securities dropped yesterday, falling back from substantial early gains and ending a two-day rally as the dollar stumbled and investor fears again turned to the threat of inflation.
Some of those fears were attributed to comments made by a Texas Republican, Bill Archer, the incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
He said in an interview on the cable channel CNBC that he favored cutting taxes.

Worthy Says His Goodbyes
James Worthy chose retirement rather than another season of decline.
His knees are arthritic, his new teammates are of another generation and his old teammates sit in the Lakers' board room.
"It was time," said Worthy, 33, the last link to Lakers' championship era.
At his side at a news conference today were his former partners Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson (now a team part-owner) and Michael Cooper (now an assistant coach).


Restaurants
A great restaurant is like a racehorse: it may take a while to discover its style, but once it does the ride is exhilarating.
Daniel, a year and a half into the race, has finally hit its stride.
"Four stars?" asks a friend one morning.
It is 8 A.M., and he is calling to say thank you for the dinner we finished a mere seven hours earlier.
"I have never had a better dinner," he says, dreamily recalling ethereal linguine topped with slender shavings of white truffle.
"If I concentrate," he adds, "I can still smell the truffles and feel those noodles dissolving in my mouth like gossamer ribbons. What a meal!"
"Can't we talk later?" I ask crossly.
But he is busy remembering a veloute filled with plump caviar-topped oysters, butter-drenched leeks and sea urchin roe.
The voluptuous flavors were rich and decadent, so that the hint of lemongrass in the cream soup combined with the bracing taste of caviar to deliver a gentle shock.
"It was perfect!" my friend insists.
"Aren't you going to give them four stars?"
"I don't know," I say. "I have to go back a few more times."
"But was there anything wrong with the meal?" he wants to know.
I pull the covers over my head and think for a moment.
I hope he'll hang up.
No such luck.
"They were nice to me when I walked in the door," he says, "and it was abundantly clear that I was not one of their regular customers. All my clothes put together did not cost as much as one of those custom-made shirts the other men were wearing. And although neither of us had a single piece of jewelry, the hostess could not have been more welcoming."
"Didn't you think the bar we waited in was awfully small and crowded?" I ask.
"Our knees were hitting those of the people next to us. I thought it was uncomfortable."
"O.K.," he admits, "it was small. But they made up for it by bringing out that plate of lovely little cheese puffs."
"They're called gougeres," I can't resist saying.
"Whatever," he says.
"They were delicious. And we only had to wait seven minutes for our table. I timed it."
"But didn't you think the dining room was awfully noisy?" I persist grumpily.
He has to concede the point; the dining room was crowded, and noisier than it should have been.
"On the other hand," he reminds me, "you said you thought the flowers were fabulous."
They were.
The drama of the flower arrangements dominates the restaurant, transforming a bland beige room into a place with personality.
There are no windows, but the flowers announce the seasons and set the stage for the food with designs so spectacular you find yourself rushing in the door to look at them.
"And you liked the service," he prods.
He is right about that, too: the service that night was smooth and sweet, more like that in a stately mansion than a large restaurant.
It was formal, thoughtful and not at all stuffy.
The waiter passed the amuses gueules as if he were serving at a dinner party, urging us to eat the tiny crab spring rolls and mushroom toasts while they were still hot.
One day at lunch, two Brazilian runners were seated at the next table.
Before they had finished their meal, the waiter had not only offered tips for tourists in New York, but also convinced them that Daniel would be the perfect place to carbo-load before the marathon; the chef, he assured them, would be happy to create some special pasta dishes.
"Remember the nine-herb ravioli?" my friend asks now.
Who could forget it?
The floppy squares of pasta were filled with a bright green puree of herbs and painted with a vivid red coulis.
Colorful leaves of herbs were scattered across the top with fragrant bits of toasted pine nuts and shavings of cheese.
"And the wild hare stew?" he asks.
At that I sit up and sniff the air.
I do remember the civet de lievre.
Its deep red wine sauce was thickened with blood and a touch of chocolate; it was so rich and exotic I was seduced into taking one bite and then another as I tried to chase the flavors back to their source.
Served with a puree of chestnuts and the roasted loin stuffed with porcini mushrooms, the stew was a masterpiece of hearty regional cooking.
Daniel Boulud was, for 6 years, the much-acclaimed chef at Le Cirque, but in his own restaurant he is working with a new confidence.
He seems to be cooking for himself with a menu that offers both hearty French food and classic cooking so technically proficient it takes your breath away.
Chilled lobster consomme is a tour de force.
The soup is as clear as crystal but so expressive of lobster that if you close your eyes and take a bite you are surprised to find your mouth filled with liquid.
The soup, decorated with rounds of lobster topped with creme fraiche and caviar, is dotted with coral cream when it is served.
This is an astonishing dish worthy of a temple of haute cuisine.
Still, if you want to continue with a less complicated course, you could order something as down-to-earth as tripes gratinees, hearty cuisine bourgeoise that would be at home in a great country bistro.
Mr.
Boulud also offers a changing celebration of the seasons: daily specials that depend on little more than great ingredients.
One might be the simple luxury of a large yellow potato mashed with lots of butter and fresh truffles, another an abundance of porcini sauteed in clarified butter, sprinkled with bits of rock salt and a small shower of herbs.
"And wasn't that foie gras fantastic?" my friend asks, reminding me of the way the unctuous liver had been balanced by the austerity of fresh quince.
Fully awake at last, I begin to revel in last night's dinner as my friend and I start shouting the names of dishes, giddily recapturing a cornucopia of flavors.
"Pumpkin soup!" I say, recalling the bright orange puree anchored by a small mound of grated squash topped with black trumpet mushrooms, tiny bits of bacon and crunchy little pumpkin seeds.
"Steamed skate!" he cries, and in my mind I can see a broth the color of clover, and feel the way the corduroy texture of the fish was emphasized by the soft lobster dumplings in watercress-lobster broth.
"Quail salad!" I say, thinking about a lunch when I was served the most appealing salad I can remember.
Leaves of mache were topped with a pair of tiny fried quail eggs and laced with velvety strips of foie gras, silky pieces of grilled quail breast and rough shavings of Parmesan cheese.
"And the wine!" my friend says, reminding me of the sommelier's suggestions from that list of fabulous and fabulously expensive bottles.
We had settled on a '91 Chassagne-Montrachet from Colin followed by a wonderfully plummy '89 Bon Pasteur.
"Desserts," my friend says now, almost reverently.
Together we recite the sweets of the evening, like children recalling Halloween treats.
I liked a fruit soup that looked like a reverse sunset, a mint green verbena ice-cream sun setting in a magenta wine-poached pear.
He liked the gratin of chocolate, a slim disk of warm chocolate on a fragile sugar wafer.
We both loved the creme brulee with macerated strawberries, and were charmed by the finale, a plate of petits fours with its fanciful pulled-sugar birds and flowers.
"So?" says my friend. "Four stars?"
"It was a great meal," I concede, pushing back the covers, "but I still have to go back and see if Daniel can sustain that level of cooking."
Five meals later, it is clear that the restaurant can.
I have had an occasional disappointment: a salty soup, a 15-minute wait for dinner, a lost reservation at lunch.
But even on an off day, the restaurant is so exciting that you wake up the morning after a meal at Daniel eager to remember every bite.
It's quite a ride.
Daniel

A Choreographer's Meditations on Death and Loss
Death is as eternal as life, as writers and painters -- more than choreographers -- have acknowledged over the centuries.
In the last 10 years, however, AIDS has profoundly transformed the dance world and engendered new themes.
In "Spectators at an Event" and "Fields of View," the experimental choreographer Susan Marshall has created two original and highly different meditations on death and a sense of loss.
Both premieres, presented on Wednesday night at the Majestic Theater (651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene) as part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival, resonate with striking images.
They are thoughtful and thought-provoking, the product of a genuinely creative mind.

Antoine-Louis Barye (1795-1875) was, like his friend Delacroix, a quintessential artist of the French Romantic movement.
Yet while Delacroix was primarily a painter of dramatic narrative, Barye is best known as a sculptor who early on settled on animals as his theme.
"Animalier" doesn't sound like an exciting category, but Barye managed to do remarkable things with it.

Talk about slipping out of the hills to bayonet the wounded!
As the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, Richard Shelby had already embarrassed Vice President Al Gore on television with his refusal to support the Clinton economic plan, so his desertion to the ictorious Republicans this week was hardly a huge surprise.


Constructing Images Of the Black Male
BY its title alone, "Black Male" at the Whitney Museum of American Art, which opened yesterday, promised to be an incendiary event from the moment it was announced.
How could it not be?
Given the political and social battleground that the issue of the black man is in our culture.
Given the storms surrounding Rodney G. King and O. J. Simpson, Clarence Thomas and Marion S. Barry Jr.
Given the racial undertones of the recent election.
And given the Whitney's penchant for flamboyant political gestures that can end up looking opportunistic and hapless.
Some people have even wondered aloud whether this is a subject for an art museum to deal with.
The answer to that question, at least, is simple.
Yes, it is.
One thing the show underscores is that artists, black and white, have specifically addressed the topic of the black male, and the amount of art devoted to it grows.
It's a rich, timely and complex vein for a museum interested in contemporary art.


Mayor Forms Special Committee to Investigate Youth Services
Acknowledging that one of his agencies had fallen into disarray, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he was creating a committee to investigate the city's Department of Youth Services and possible mismanagement in its awarding of contracts to community organizations.
The Mayor said the review would complement an inquiry already undertaken by the city's Department of Investigation into possible wrongdoing at the department and he revealed that the department was looking into charges that someone had altered documents involved in the awarding of contracts.


The Rising G.O.P. Tide Overwhelms the Democratic Levees in the South
As Democrats around the country pick up the pieces from the Republican landslide on Tuesday, nowhere is the shock greater, the losses bigger and the implications harsher than in the South.
In 1990, Democrats in 13 Southern states outnumbered Republicans in the House of Representatives by 83 to 46.
Now, Republicans for the first time since Reconstruction outnumber Democrats 73 to 64.
For good measure, Republicans also lead the Democrats in Southern Senate seats and Governor's posts for the first time since Reconstruction.


New Majority's Agenda: Substantial Changes May Be Ahead
When Republicans take control of the Senate and House in January, they will propose a legislative agenda drastically different from President Clinton's, which could lead to substantial changes in a broad array of Federal programs and laws, as well as the workings of Congress.
Following are brief looks at the main issues.
THE BUDGET AND TAXES
The Republicans are holding to President Ronald Reagan's politically tested view that they can lower taxes for middle-income and wealthy people and still balance the Federal budget within a few years.
But that goal cannot be accomplished unless the Republicans find much deeper spending reductions than they have proposed so far.

At the Bar; A code that defines Albania has a mixed role in shaping a legal system for that country.
For the last three years, American lawyers and judges have been journeying here to help this Balkan country develop a modern system of law.
And despite the rejection of a constitution in a national referendum, their combined pro bono efforts have been successful: a bill of rights adopted by Parliament; a criminal code awaiting approval, and legislation passed on hazardous waste, land use and commercial activities.
There have been snags, however.
American legal experts in Albania have invariably come up against a deeply imbedded common law tradition that is at least 500 years old.


Mexican Telephone Shares Drop Sharply
A day after AT&amp;T announced that it would compete against Telefonos de Mexico rather than join with it in providing long-distance service here, shares of the Mexican telephone company plummeted 8 percent, dragging the stock market to one of its worst losses of the year.
The market fell 126.62 points, or 4.83 percent, to close at 2,492.32.
Telmex, the largest private company in Mexico, accounts for 26 percent of the exchange's total capitalization.


Images to Cherish in the Realm of the Word
On the lower level of the Museum of Modern Art there is an exhibition, "A Century of Artists Books," that harks back to the glory days when the museum was still very young.
It has the further merit of being up to date, with the latest in the avant-garde book.
It begins with a celebrated and monumental achievement that is exactly 100 years old: the Kelmscott Press Chaucer, designed and printed by William Morris and illustrated with wood engravings after Edward Burne-Jones.

Giacometti, Surveyed From Start to Finish
Exceptional exhibitions of the work of Alberto Giacometti (1901-1966), the Swiss artist who brought a new psychological reality to figurative sculpture in the years after World War II, are becoming somewhat frequent in Manhattan.
In the last 18 months, both the Gagosian Gallery and the Yoshii Gallery have examined aspects of Giacometti's achievement in small, focused shows.
Now the Acquavella Gallery is taking its turn, with an exhibition, far from small, that presents a brisk synopsis of nearly the artist's entire career.
With more than 70 works, a vast majority of them bronzes, that together span nearly five decades, this exhibition lacks the sharp focus of its predecessors (especially the Yoshii show, which presented a rare and touching view of the artist as a young sculptor).
Nor is its synopsis complete: although it includes the haunting 1932 masterpiece "Woman With Her Throat Cut," it passes rather lightly over the artist's Surrealist period of the late 1920's and early 30's and has nothing in plaster or wood, his frequent materials during those years.


Drowning Case Embitters U.S. Race Relations
To the Editor:
The headlines in the major newspapers read similarly: "Mom Killed Kids," "2 Bodies Found, Mother Held in Children's Death." As a human being, I couldn't help being mortified by the senseless tragedy.
As an African-American, I couldn't help being disgusted and angry.
Why?
Because this disturbing ordeal painfully shows that black men have become the symbol for society's ills.


First State Audits Show Two Municipalities How to Save Money as Whitman Cuts Aid
Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman today delivered the first installment of her promise to show New Jersey's municipalities and school districts how to live with her state tax cuts, releasing audits that list potential tax savings of millions of dollars in one town but less in another.
Kearny, a Hudson County town of 35,000, could save $2.6 million a year, equal to nearly 17 percent of its tax receipts, according to the audit.
A second audit of the town of Ventnor, in Atlantic County, showed much smaller but still significant potential savings.

Round 1 to Ewing and Knicks in Final 2.4 Seconds
Faced with an early-season test, Patrick Ewing made a Grade A shot under pressure.
Making a 12-foot baseline jumper with 2.4 seconds to play, Ewing lifted the Knicks to a heart-pounding 101-99 victory over the Orlando Magic last night at Madison Square Garden.
Not only did the victory keep the Knicks unbeaten (3-0), but it sent a signal to a team that is one of their biggest threats in the Eastern Conference.


A New Guideline on History Looks Beyond Old Europe
A Federal education panel today will announce new world-history standards that keep William the Conqueror and the Battle of Hastings in public-school lesson plans but also give emphasis to non-European hallmarks like China's Sung dynasty, which developed paper currency, gunpowder and wood-block book printing from the 10th to the 13th century.
The standards, which are voluntary, retain the study of the Greek city-states and the Roman Empire but add the Mauryan Empire in India and the Olmec culture, which influenced the Zapotec and Mayan civilizations.

William R. Hesse, an advertising executive who headed one of the nation's largest agencies and the American Association of Advertising Agencies, died Tuesday at his home in Yarmouthport, Mass.

Angola's Rebel on the Ropes
By the ordinary calculus of war, Jonas Savimbi, the guerrilla warrior whose quest for power has left Angola in ruins, at last appears to be a beaten man.
The rebel leader has lost his ground.

He has lost much of his popular support.
He has lost the diamond fields that financed his army.
And this week he lost his capital when the Angolan Army entered the rebels' symbolic stronghold of Huambo.

Sears, Returning to Its Roots, Is Giving Up Allstate
Completing a return to its retailing roots, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company said today that it would give control of the Allstate Corporation to Sears shareholders, shedding the last remnant of its grand strategy to build a financial services empire on the shoulders of its huge retailing business.
By transferring to its shareholders ownership of its $9 billion stake in Allstate, the nation's second-largest insurer of homes and autos, after the State Farm Group, Sears will complete one of the largest corporate revampings in business history.
The divestment will cap the 37-year career of Edward A. Brennan, the chairman and chief executive since 1986, who steered the company through several years of expansion, crisis and restructuring.

Usery Restarts Talks, But Ravitch Is Silent
In the first bargaining session in two months, baseball's club owners today offered to take their coveted salary cap off the table.
The offer, however, wasn't as magnanimous or as significant as it might appear, because the owners attached a large but to the idea.
They would remove the cap, Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, told union negotiators, if the players would tell them what their labor costs would be.
But the owners have made that request for five months, meaning nothing new transpired between the negotiators as they resumed talks in the 91-day-old strike.

Topics of The Times; Connecticut Revisits its Income Tax
Let no one quibble about John Rowland's 36 percent victory in Connecticut.
His share of the vote for governor in a four-way race was not significantly less than Lowell Weicker's winning share in a three-way race in 1990.
Governor Weicker used his victory to force adoption of a personal income tax.
Mr.
Rowland, a Republican with the advantage of a newly elected Republican majority in the State Senate, is pledged to repeal it.
Repeal poses two threats: The tax will yield $2.7 billion this year, more than one-quarter of the $9.4 billion budget.
Mr.
Rowland maintains that he can offset half the revenue loss with spending cuts that will not cut services -- a dubious proposition -- and that healthier economic activity will offset the other half.
Just as bad, the state would again be dependent on regressive sales taxes, and taxes on dividends and corporations that drive people and businesses away.

In Small but Sure Ways, the Art Market Shifts
There were subtle changes this fall in the complexion of the market for contemporary, Impressionist and modern art in Manhattan.
Both Sotheby's and Christie's edited their auctions, making them leaner and more carefully thought out than the spring sales.
Catalogues were smaller, and the art was generally of better quality.
This was the season for repairing the damage done in the spring, when greedy estimates coupled with stale offerings resulted in disaster.
The auction houses wanted their fall sales, which ended yesterday, to inspire confidence.

Mr.
Frame, who was known for painstaking research and attention to detail, illustrated many books in the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys series, as well as editions of "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer," "Casey at the Bat" and "Knights of the Round Table."

"To say that that's not the case is fooling yourself. We are struggling right now, but hopefully this week, we'll turn things around with a win."


In Their Own Words: The Republican Promises
During the election campaign, Republican candidates for Congress gathered in Washington to endorse a set of proposals for legislative action that they called their "Contract With America." They said that in the first 100 days of the 104th Congress, they would introduce bills they described as follows: 1.
The Fiscal Responsibility Act: A balanced budget/tax limitation amendment and a legislative line-item veto to restore fiscal responsibility to an out-of-control Congress, requiring them to live under the same budget constraints as families and businesses. 2.
The Taking Back Our Streets Act: An anti-crime package including stronger truth-in-sentencing, "good faith" exclusionary rule exemptions, effective death penalty provisions, and cuts in social spending from this summer's "crime" bill to fund prison construction and additional law enforcement to keep people secure in their neighborhoods and kids safe in their schools. 3.
The Personal Responsibility Act: Discourage illegitimacy and teen pregnancy by prohibiting welfare to minor mothers and denying increased AFDC for additinal children while on welfare, cut spending for welfare programs, and enact a tough two-years-and-out provision with work requirements to promote individual responsibility. 4.
The Family Reinforcement Act: Child support enforcement, tax incentive for adoption, strengthening rights of parents in their children's education, stronger child pornography laws, and an elderly dependent care tax credit to reinforce the central role of families in American society. 5.
The American Dream Restoration Act: A $500 per child tax credit, begin repeal of the marriage tax penalty, and creation of American Dream Savings Accounts to provide middle class tax relief. 6.
The National Security Restoration Act: No U.S. troops under U.N. command and restoration of the essential parts of our national security funding to strengthen our national defense and maintain our credibility around the world. 7.
The Senior Citizens Fairness Act: Raise the Social Security earnings limit which currently forces seniors out of the work force, repeal the 1993 tax hikes on Social Security benefits and provide tax incentive for private long-term care insurance to let older Americans keep more of what they have earned over the years. 8.
The Hob Creation and Wage Enhancement Act: Small business incentives, capital gains cut and indexation, neutral cost recovery, risk assessment/cost-benefit analysis, strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act and unfunded mandate reform to create jobs and raise worker wages. 9.
The Common Sense Legal Reform Act: "Loser pays" laws, reasonable limits on punitive damages and reform of product liablility laws to stem the endless tide of litigation. 10.
The Citizen Legislative Act: A first ever vote on term limits to replace career politicians with citizen legislators.

E.P.A. Delays A Decision On Emissions
The Federal Environmental Protection Agency, which was supposed to announce yesterday whether California's strict automobile emissions standards would be applied to 12 eastern states, will spend an additional month trying to broker a compromise between the states and the auto industry.
Carol M. Browner, the agency's administrator, said yesterday at a news conference in Washington that the delay would allow the E.P.A. to work for improved national emissions standards and a regulatory scheme that is simpler for everyone.


Silence May Speak Against the Accused in Britain
In Britain, as in the United States, people arrested for a criminal offense have received a ritual police warning: They have the right to refuse to answer all questions put to them by investigators.
It is only what they say that can be used against them.
But in the coming months, police officers in Britain will begin delivering another and markedly different caution to those they apprehend.
While suspects will still be told that they do not have to talk to officers, they will be warned as well that their silence might count against them, if their case goes to trial.


Irish End Is Charged
Notre Dame's MICHAEL MILLER, a receiver and return man, has been charged in Texas in what prosecutors call a scheme to steal and forge checks to buy $50,000 worth of airline tickets, clothes and alcohol.
Miller turned himself in on Wednesday, one day after Notre Dame Coach LOU HOLTZ announced without explanation that Miller had left school.
Miller was being held on $5,000 bond.
If convicted on a charge of organized criminal activity, he could be sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Rudolf Stingel  Paula Cooper Gallery 155 Wooster Street (near Houston Street) SoHo Through Nov. 26
The two floor-to-ceiling abstract paintings by Rudolf Stingel in Paula Cooper's front gallery are at once self-effacing and technically complex.
Their brushy vermilion underpainting has been sprayed with a semi-opaque screen of silver pigment, whose sheen turns almost white at a distance.
The paintings' surfaces appear to be interrupted by wrinkles and creases as if the canvas were only loosely fitted to its stretcher.
In fact, these patterns are created by applying enamel paint whipped to a froth to the taut surfaces so that it leaves ridges and indentations when it dries.

More Than a Monument: The Spiritual Dimension of These Hallowed Walls
Americans have long revered places that they link to the shaping of their national identity: the bridge at Concord, the Alamo, the hulk of the battleship Arizona at Pearl Harbor.
Few pieces of ground are so hallowed as Gettysburg, where the Civil War battle and Lincoln's address paired national unity and purpose in a way that is seen as almost mystical.
But veneration occasionally imparts even more to a hallowed site: a spiritual dimension that transforms it into something like a sacred shrine, where pilgrims come and devotions are paid.
For generations, Gettysburg was such a place.
The Vietnam Veterans Memorial, several scholars of religion and culture say, is becoming one now.

While most marketers of luxury goods have relied on trademark laws to prevent the diversion of their products to discount stores, Givenchy, the American arm of the French perfume company, has been successfully using copyright law.

Ground Beef That May Be Tainted Is Recalled
The Department of Agriculture has announced the recall of 9,000 pounds of ground beef from Monfort Inc., a food processing firm in Greeley, Colo.
The company is voluntarily recalling the meat because it may be contaminated with E. coli, bacteria that was responsible for the deaths of four children and the illness of hundreds of others in the Northwest last year.
Two products are affected by the recall, which was announced on Tuesday.
One is Monfort 100 Percent Pure Beef Ground Round in 3-pound packages with "freeze by 11/3/94" on the label, sold in Walmart stores in Arkansas and Texas.
The other is Manor House 100 Percent Pure Ground Beef in 5-pound packages marked "use or freeze by 11/03 EST969," sold in Safeway stores in Denver.

Mr. Dole's Packwood Problem
For members of Congress eager to exercise real power, there is nothing sweeter than heading an important committee.
This week's election means that House and Senate Republicans are about to get that chance.
But Senate Republican leaders face one awkward dilemma: the all-but-certain elevation of Bob Packwood of Oregon to head the pivotal Finance Committee.
Mr.
Packwood may be a talented legislator, but he remains the subject of a major Ethics Committee inquiry.
In addition to the original charges of sexual misconduct involving numerous women, the Ethics Committee is said to be looking into possible tampering with evidence by the Senator to obstruct the inquiry, and a charge that he improperly asked lobbyists to offer a job to his wife when she was divorcing him.

Jazz Finds a Lonely Follower in the Australian Desert
One day in the remote Australian village of Poona Flat, strange music drops out of the sky, and a little boy named John Anderson has an epiphany.
It is 1969.
A cargo plane carrying members of a jazz ensemble has been diverted to the outback for an unscheduled layover.
As the villagers stare, dumbfounded, seven musicians file onto the runway and give an impromptu jazz concert.
John is riveted by the sounds coming from the trumpet of the group's lead player, Billy Cross (Miles Davis).
"You seemed tuned into it," Billy tells the star-struck boy afterward.
"If you ever come to Paris, look me up."
So begins Rolf de Heers's film "Dingo," a wildly romantic story about a jazz musician in pursuit of his muse.
The 1991 film, which opens a two-week engagement today at Cinema Village, jumps forward two decades.
John (Colin Friels), now married and the father of two girls, ekes out a living trapping the Australian wild dogs known as dingos.
A largely self-taught trumpeter who has learned the instrument by studying Billy Cross records, he plays on weekends with a local "bush band," whose skiffle-style rock-and-roll has nothing to do with jazz.
Alone in the desert, he aims his instrument at the sky and produces lonely warbling doglike cries that echo the sounds of his idol's records, and earn him the nickname Dingo.


Republicans Stand Ready To Transform the Agenda
Republican control of Congress holds the potential for an upheaval in the capital's legislative agenda, with Republican lawmakers pressing proposals ranging from cutting taxes to changing the welfare system to reducing foreign aid.
The dimensions of the possible changes became clear today when a leading Republican lawmaker said one of his long-range goals was to replace the Federal income tax with other sources of revenue.
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, in line to become chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, where tax laws originate, outlined plans today for a quick tax cut and said he would like to see "a complete replacement of the income tax," perhaps with a national sales tax.

Pataki Voices Shock at Learning Size of Gap in Budget He Inherits
Governor-elect George E. Pataki expressed shock today upon learning that he would inherit a projected $4 billion budget shortfall next year from the Cuomo administration, but said he remained committed to his campaign pledge to cut income taxes by 25 percent over four years.
Mr.
Pataki also asserted that the Cuomo administration should have taken steps to close next year's budget gap this year.
"There's no question if there is that much of a deficit looming that it should have been revealed and steps should have been taken during the course of the year to correct our spending problems so we wouldn't be facing them come next April," he said.
The state's fiscal year begins on April 1.


Farm Life of the 20's For Children of the 90's
I TOOK my two children to Muscoot Farm on a dreary Sunday in November, when the bored quarreling that begins on a day to be spent indoors sent me running for a map and extra sweat shirts and dry socks to stuff in a shopping bag.
The farm, in the Westchester County town of Somers, is a long drive from our house in New Jersey, and there were moments, as we approached the Tappan Zee Bridge, when I had my doubts as the rain and the unseasonably warm temperature wrapped the car in a white haze.
My daughters ate the Halloween candy they had brought and submerged themselves in headsets and the silence that usually means the Offspring and Pink Floyd.
But it was raining, and I was on the run from a Sunday indoors.
"A farm?" Susan, 12, had asked in disbelief.
In an instant, she remembered a major school project on Ulysses S. Grant that was due the next day.
She didn't need a trip to a farm.
She had to do her homework.
"Do it later," I told her.

All Gassed Up With Not Much Place to Go
At least "Pontiac Moon" is what it sounds like: a movie about a Pontiac and about the moon.
If there is anything else pleasant to be said, it's that the car is a cream-colored 1949 Pontiac Chief convertible in excellent condition.
Both it and the moon look nice.
Now then: the film contrives a connection between the car and the Apollo XI moon shot.
The idea is that because the car's odometer has almost reached the 238,857 miles the astronauts will traverse on their trip to the moon, driving the car the remaining distance will become a meaningful symbolic gesture.
With typical understatement, this plan is referred to as "one perfect act" and culminates in "that day the universe was reborn."

Market Place; Allstate's size helps profits, but also makes for added risk.
AS one of the nation's largest insurers of homes and autos, the Allstate Corporation reaps the rewards of name recognition and economies of scale that in normal times help make it very profitable.
But with that size comes additional risk that the company would just as soon avoid, or at least reduce.
A $2.7 billion loss in 1992 from Hurricane Andrew in Florida and a $1.3 billion loss from the Los Angeles earthquake early this year have wreaked havoc on Allstate's profits.
After a loss of $500 million in 1992, the company saw profits jump to a record $1.3 billion in disaster-free 1993, but earnings have slumped to $320.7 million in the first nine months of this year.


For Better Troop Living, $2.7 Billion Is Shifted From Weapons
Aiming to avert potentially serious morale and recruiting problems, the Pentagon plans to spend an additional $2.7 billion over the next six years to improve housing conditions, child care and other programs for troops and their families, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said today.
The shift in the Pentagon's priorities comes in response to several trends that have alarmed senior officials concerned about the social consequences of reducing the size of the military.
They say that the number of military families on food stamps is increasing, for example; that spousal-abuse rates are rising, and that troops are spending more and more time away from home.

California Immigration Measure Faces Rocky Legal Path

The measure, called "Save Our State" by sponsors, is based on the premise that California's bounty of social services is the magnet drawing illegal immigrants across the border.
Turning it off, proponents argue, will deter new arrivals.

In no case among the 50 states' 99 chambers did Democrats manage to wrest control from Republicans.
Indeed, the party did not achieve a net gain of seats on Tuesday anywhere except a handful of Northeastern states and Hawaii.

Cable TV: Finally, Getting It Right
The Federal Communications Commission agreed this week to loosen some of the price controls it imposed earlier this year on cable operators.
Critics charged that the F.C.C. had knuckled under to a powerful industry and cheated consumers.
But the decision is welcome; it is consumers who suffer most from punitive rate caps.
In 1992, Congress responded to viewer outrage and instructed the F.C.C. to rein in price-gouging cable operators.
But where a scalpel was needed to go after a few bad actors, the commission wielded a meat ax against 11,000 cable operators across the nation.
Relying on an unreliable statistical model, the commission imposed a complex set of rules that it promised would yield a rate rollback of up to 10 percent -- the amount of monopoly profit the commission estimated was built into monthly bills.

A Virulent Potato Fungus Is Killing the Northeast Crop
Nearly 150 years after the Irish famine of the 1840's, new virulent strains of the fungus that devastated the potato crop in Ireland are spreading across New York and many other states, plant pathologists say.
The fungus does not pose a threat to the nation's potato crop.
In fact, this year the national crop was up 7 percent over last year's, with a record 46 billion pounds.

Religious-Right Candidates Gain as G.O.P. Turnout Rises
Candidates aligned with conservative religious groups scored major gains on Tuesday in an election in which turnout increased among Republicans in every region of the country, two surveys showed today.
A study by People for the American Way, a group that calls itself "a voice against intolerance," found that 60 percent of the 600 candidates for national, state and local offices who were supported by religious conservatives won their elections.

Health Care Plan Out; Health Care Stocks In
HEALTH care stocks enjoyed an election bounce this week as the Republican victory dashed any hopes of reviving President Clinton's ambitious health care plan.
But the stocks have been gaining momentum for months.
In fact, some of the mutual funds that invest in them are having outstanding years, in large part because of a sparkling third quarter.
The leaders, both from Fidelity, are its Medical Delivery fund, up 20.9 percent, and its Health Care fund, up 17.5 percent.

Sacrifice Forms Part of Doctor's Training
To the Editor:
"Medical Fellowships Didn't Benefit in Zion Case" (letter, Nov. 8) by Sima Bernstein, wife of a physician in training to become a pediatric cardiologist, expressed concern that his work schedule was playing havoc with his health and attributed physical symptoms to his intense responsibility to care for patients.
The young doctor in question serves in a fellowship program that dictates that a trainee will spend two months a year for two years with night-call responsibilities, as well as occasional weekends.
When the physician is on call (which does not include arbitrary in-hospital time at night, as resident physicians have), a back-up system is available for unusually long periods.


Grits and Glitter Campaign Helps Actor Who Played a Senator Become One
In an election year when voters all but screamed their displeasure with Democratic incumbents and Big Government, here came Fred Thompson in his canvas work shirt and a rented Chevrolet pickup truck, looking more like a man who would stuff and mount a largemouth bass than like the lawyer, lobbyist and big-time Hollywood character actor that he is.
His political opponents say it was just one more role for the man who has acted in 18 feature films in 10 years.
Mr.
Thompson, a huge 6-foot-6 Republican with a drawl that rumbles like an approaching storm, swears he is playing only himself.


After a Hole-in-One, 79-Year-Old Man Dies
Moments after shooting his first hole-in-one, Emil Kijek collapsed and died on the golf course Thursday.
Emergency medical workers tried unsuccessfully to revive Kijek, 79, of North Attleboro, Mass., but he was pronounced dead at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence.
The hospital declined to release the cause of death yesterday.
A funeral home said Kijek, who played golf as many as four times a week, suffered from hypertension.


A Singer Who Doesn't Play That Nice Girl Next Door
Diamanda Galas never does anything nice and easy.
She pushes her voice to its limits, shrieking and cackling, rasping and swooping, howling and ululating.
John Paul Jones helped make rock history with his walloping bass lines in Led Zeppelin.
Together, the two connoisseurs of excess have made an album, "The Sporting Life" (Mute), and on Thursday night at Irving Plaza, they performed their new songs.
The program was a set of homicidal love songs, with Ms.
Galas casting herself as rapacious, vengeful, wild-eyed and distraught, channeling pain and fury into tortuous vocal acrobatics.
She was a woman about to murder her husband in "Do You Take This Man?," a lusty predator in "You're Mine." Wearing a black vinyl brassiere and tight pants, she stared into the audience, dropped to her knees or waved her arms in preacherly gestures, an indefatigable banshee.


In Venezuelan Dancers, Shades of Soviet Style
The Ballet Metropolitano de Caracas, which performs again tonight with its engaging and sleekly schooled junior ballerinas, is the equivalent of an American regional ballet troupe.
Visibly the outgrowth of the school in which most of its young dancers have been trained, it aspires just as obviously to the top ranks it has yet to reach.
Keyla Ermecheo studied in New York at the School of American Ballet and the American Ballet Theater school, returned to Venezuela in 1968 and established her own school.
In 1980, she founded Ballet Metropolitano, which has an impressively strong stylistic imprint.


A Wealth Of Facts On Shuttles
There's almost too much information packed into "Space Shuttle" to absorb in two hours.
It comes in fancily photographed bits and pieces, from scientists, engineers, administrators, astronauts and others of the 30,000 people involved in the care and launching of space shuttles and their passengers.
None of it is uninteresting (I learned that astronauts wear diapers), but the documentary, powered by a persistent musical beat, moves along so fast that a serious issue mentioned along the way is nearly lost in the quick cuts and odd angles.
The question raised by scientists like Carl Sagan is whether manned space flight is worth the cost in money and lives.
Critics say the sort of information gathered by the shuttles could be obtained more cheaply and efficiently by instruments on disposable craft.
One scientist points out that since there is no space station out there, the shuttles really have no place to go.

Issues of Race and Pollution Trouble L.I. Town
For years, residents of this predominantly black and Hispanic working-class community have held their noses, shut their windows and tried hard not to dwell on the smells and the unsightliness of the 170-acre industrial site just across the railroad tracks.
The putrid odors from the chemical plants and garbage-transfer stations and fish processing factories make some people sick.
But they are so taken for granted in New Cassel, directly downwind of the plants, that few residents lodge complaints.
In fact, Nassau County health officials say, a vast majority of complaints have come from wealthier, primarily white communities upwind of the plants like Salisbury and South Westbury, where the smells are not nearly so intense.

Carmen McRae Is Dead at 74; Jazz Career Spanned 5 Decades
Carmen McRae, the jazz singer known for her probing interpretations of lyrics and her bruised but unbowed point of view, died on Thursday evening at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif.
She was 74.
She had fallen into a semi-coma four days earlier, a month after being hospitalized for a stroke, said her secretary, Jan March.
She withdrew from public performance in May 1991 after an episode of respiratory failure only hours after she completed an engagement at the Blue Note jazz club in New York.

N.Y.R.A. Cuts Week to Five Days
The streamlining of New York racing took a step forward yesterday when the five-day week was approved, starting in December.
Kenneth Noe, the new chief executive officer, pledged, "We may carry it further, too, including Sundays in the pro football season."
When Noe took office as president and general manager of the New York Racing Association two weeks ago, he said: "We've got too much racing. I intend to do something real quick. The five-day week? Absolutely."


Shock Treatment for the Budget
Governor-elect George Pataki finds it "shocking" that New York State faces a huge budget gap next year.
But people who keep an eye on the state's finances have known for months that the situation was bad and getting worse.
The gap will make it that much harder for Mr.
Pataki to deliver his promised tax cuts.
According to sources in the Cuomo administration, as well as outside budget-watchers, revenues in the fiscal year beginning next April 1 are likely to fall short of projected spending by about $4 billion.
Mr.
Pataki must find ways to close that gap before he presents his first budget.
Having promised lower taxes, he will presumably try to balance the books with spending cuts and restraints, and by revenue growth from a healthier economy.

Gingrich Queried By Ethics Panel
The House ethics committee has notified Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia that a number of questions have been raised about his use of a Republican fund-raising organization to develop and finance a college course he taught last year.
The action by the panel, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, which has seven Democratic and seven Republican members, was first reported in Saturday's issue of The Washington Post and was confirmed by a Gingrich aide.
Mr.
Gingrich was told of the committee's concerns in a letter sent to him a week before Tuesday's elections, in which the Republicans won control of the House and he became Speaker-apparent.


Gingrich, Now a Giant, Claims Victor's Spoils
Once, Newt Gingrich was the man with the big agenda, small press entourage and slightly banged-up Honda Accord.
Today, victorious and shining in the camera lights, he unfurled from the glinting black Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham that matches his new status as the big man in town, strode to a lectern, grinned and spurned any sort of compromise with the White House.
Condemning the "counterculture" and warning that "the question is whether or not our civilization will survive," the likely Speaker of the House called the election on Tuesday a mandate to reclaim old-fashioned values of hard work and swift justice.

And the Republican pols can spout pieties about working together for the American people while Newt Gingrich goes straight for the neck flesh, calling names, talking trash, practicing his patented brand of "I'm-O.K.-You're-Scum" attack politics.
But one thing I know for sure, looking back on this election.
And that is that this country lost its two most compelling and charismatic political figures when Mario Cuomo was rejected by the voters of New York and Ann Richards by those in Texas.


Giuliani Tries to End Feud, But His Phone Isn't Ringing
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani called his fellow Republicans petty, ungracious and dangerously overconfident yesterday for the retaliation they are inflicting on him for supporting Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, and he warned them that if in trying to punish him, they hurt New York City, they would only hurt themselves, too.
Still feeling the stings of retribution for his stunning -- and, in hindsight, inopportune -- decision to endorse the Democratic Governor, Mr.
Giuliani appeared to be shoring up his weakened political position and trying to send a message that the city's interests could not be ignored.


'Lady Macbeth,' Hated by Stalin, Finally Has Its Debut at the Met
Stalin was right.
Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk," which received its long-overdue Metropolitan Opera premiere on Thursday night, is indeed "crude, primitive, vulgar." That was what Pravda proclaimed in 1936 after the Soviet tyrant walked out on a performance of the work, inspiring the most famous and most devastating music review ever published.
As Pravda noted, a bed is at the center of the action, and there is nothing subtle about the music that accompanies the squeaking of its springs; Shostakovich nearly lost his life over his sound effects.
But this opera is also one of the great masterworks of the century, written by a young composer who had already developed his trademark combination of sarcasm, pathos, farce and fierceness.
Shostakovich created a Soviet version of "Madame Bovary" in which Katerina, a bored, bourgeois housewife, faced with an almost criminally banal society, discovers the pleasures and dangers of love and murder (both of which sound astonishingly similar in the score).


Sports of The Times; A Beacon Of Light In Charlotte
WHEN Bill Simms talks about life, he often talks about "steps." Probably because he was a hurdler, well-versed in the importance of measuring each stride: too many or too few can be the difference between barely winning, narrowly losing.
Even as he looks at the flow of his life -- growing up poor in Indianapolis to running track at the University of Southern California to now serving as a top executive in a major corporation -- Simms thinks steps: "I could have stepped left, instead of stepping right, and walked right into a wasted life."

Marklein's time was more than three quarters of an hour faster than the previous New York record, 2:55, set last year by Bob Neumayer, a perennial New York winner.
Neumayer cut 23 minutes off his previous best by finishing third in 2:37, 5 minutes behind David Maccaccman of New Zealand.
Dick Traum, president of the Achilles Track Club, said yesterday that this was the first time wheelchair competitors had been encouraged, not just tolerated.

Homeless Sleeping in City Office: Last Resort Is Now Part of System
Despite a decade of rulings barring the city from keeping the homeless overnight in offices and millions in fines levied for violating those orders, there was 1-month-old Nicholas Brian Gonzalez asleep in his stroller, packed in among the human steerage of New York City's overloaded homeless system.
Sick with fever and diarrhea, Nicholas spent his fourth straight night earlier this week at the city's after-hours homeless office in the Bronx.
On many nights, hundreds of people continue to take refuge in the office, where straight-back plastic chairs or a plot of dirty floor are luxuries for the weary.

DOUG MOSS, president of the MSG Network since 1992, was named president of the Buffalo Sabres yesterday.
Moss's departure is the first among top MSG executives since Cablevision and ITT agreed to buy Madison Square Garden.
Moss takes over the Sabres' management two years before the opening of Crossroads Arena.
"They want to sell and market the team very aggressively," Moss said.


At the Patent Office, a Digital Dawn
Gerald Goldberg has a dream: to plow through the Patent Office's backlog of 17,000 software patent applications.
But he may also have a nightmare: somewhere in the heap lies another Compton's New Media case, ticking like an unexploded bomb.
A 30-year veteran of patent examination, Mr.
Goldberg directs the Patent and Trademark Office's computer inventions section.
In a warren of tiny offices, he oversees 185 engineers and scientists, who scrutinize tattered, color-coded application files.
But now, largely in response to the recent Compton's case, a 14-month ordeal in which the Patent Office was reviled by most of the software industry, Mr.
Goldberg is trying to drag his operation into the digital age.

Topics of The Times; Rollins Redux in New Jersey
Ed Rollins, manager of Christine Todd Whitman's successful campaign to be governor of New Jersey, stunned the political world last year by boasting that his staff had paid opposition Democratic workers not to work on Election Day.
It turned out to be a lie -- according to Mr.
Rollins himself -- but for weeks political conversation buzzed with talk of "street money."
Street money is a perfectly legitimate payment by a political party to workers who go from house to house and into malls and commuter terminals to get out the vote.
Payments were in cash until Mr.
Rollins suggested he had used such money for dirty purposes.
Whereupon the embarrassed Republicans who control the State Legislature required that future payments be made by check, so everyone could know who paid what to whom.


World News Briefs; American in Guatemala Ends Her Hunger Strike
A month after an American lawyer began a hunger strike to force the Guatemalan Government to tell her what happened to her husband, a guerrilla leader, she sipped some diluted papaya juice this morning and called off her strike but vowed to continue to search.
The protest by the lawyer, Jennifer Harbury, 43, on the central plaza in Guatemala City focused attention on rights abuses in Guatemala.


U.S. Supports Asia-Pacific Free Trade, but Questions Timing
A meeting of representatives from 18 countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean opened on Friday with signs that the United States had reservations about how rapidly different countries should move toward achieving free trade across the region.
The central question at the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which continued through this morning, was whether the 18 member countries would agree to lower trade barriers by the proposed date of 2020.
The United States is a big backer of the free trade proposals and of the 2020 deadline.


Girl Flees After Clash Of Cultures On Illness
Officials in this Central Valley town are not sure whether to look for Lee Lor, a 15-year-old Hmong girl with cancer who ran away from home two weeks ago with a backpack full of herbal medicines but no money.
The authorities here are uncertain because the girl's parents -- and the entire community of Hmong, transplants from the mountains of Southeast Asia -- say they do not believe Lee has cancer and do not want her to have chemotherapy.


Topics of The Times; Parents Get Their Say
Parents, who could make a positive difference in New York City's neglected schools, are themselves a neglected resource.
That can be corrected during Open School Week, which runs from next Monday through Thursday.
It is important for the schools and for employers to make it as easy as possible for parents to participate.
This is the time of year when parents are formally invited to discuss their children's progress with teachers and to become more familiar with school programs.
The United Federation of Teachers has issued more than a million booklets with suggested questions parents might want to ask.
The booklet also contains a questionnaire on conditions in schools.
Parents are asked to report on a range of subjects: whether classrooms and bathrooms are dirty or clean, for example, and whether their children receive instruction in music and art.


Flower Glower: Paterno Isn't Ready to Stop and Smell the Roses
Joe Paterno was making a point.
From the time his Penn State Nittany Lions defeated Michigan nearly a month ago, expectations focused on the imposing defensive unit of Illinois.
But as the matchup with the Illini came closer, attention shifted to the loss of a share of the No. 1 ranking last weekend and a trip to Pasadena, Calif., that may be secured Saturday afternoon.
In the Happy Valley, everything is coming up. . . .


Benzonia Journal; Deer Season Is Back, But It Isn't What It Was
This time of year in northwestern Michigan, it seems as if there are two kinds of people: those who hunt, and those who don't.
And because the number of those who don't is increasing in this fast-growing rural area, the deer hunting season, once a time of elaborate preparation and restless expectation, is becoming something else entirely.
For many people -- hunters and nonhunters alike -- the 16-day deer season, which begins on Tuesday, is bringing unresolved conflicts and a sense of menace.

Move on Bosnia By U.S. Alarms Allies in NATO
European allies expressed alarm today over the Clinton Administration's decision to end Washington's role in enforcing an arms embargo against the Bosnian Government, warning that the unilateral move undermined NATO and could diminish the chances for peace in the Balkans.
The decision seemed to thrust the United States into its most serious diplomatic rift over the Balkan war since early 1993, when Washington failed to convince NATO partners to lift the embargo and to bomb Serbian forces who were trouncing Bosnia's mainly Muslim Government.

Six weeks after steamrolling over a strike by staff lawyers for the Legal Aid Society and threatening to stop doing business with them altogether, the Giuliani administration has offered the organization a new contract with strict terms like a no-strike clause, monthly and quarterly audits, a taut budget and creation of a bureau to handle new cases more expeditiously.
Officials for Legal Aid staunchly maintained that the proposed contract, which will pay the Society $62.4 million a year, preserves the nonprofit organization's standing as the primary representative for the city's indigent criminal defendants.
But the Giuliani administration made it clear that City Hall was keeping its options open.

He was 51.

A Politician At the Rubicon
When Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani bolted his own party and endorsed Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo, he knew something the public did not: that Mr.
Cuomo's campaign polls had begun to show him moving ahead of State Senator George E. Pataki.
The public polls still had Mr.
Cuomo behind and would not show him moving ahead until days after Mr.
Giuliani's endorsement.
Some analysts attributed that movement to Mr.
Giuliani's strong support for the Governor, and that could have been the reason, or one of the reasons.
Still, it was no surprise to the Cuomo camp or to the Mayor: The Cuomo campaign conducted tracking polls every night, was making them available to Mr.
Giuliani, and they were optimistic.
On Saturday afternoon, two days before the Mayor's endorsement on Oct. 24, Mr.
Giuliani, Deputy Mayor Peter Powers, David Garth and a Garth associate, Richard Bryers, met in Mr.
Garth's office and examined the polls.
They placed Mr.
Cuomo four to five percentage points ahead.

Newt Gingrich is going to talk for a while now, and thoughtful citizens will be well advised to listen.
As long as he is in the throes of post-election gloating, Mr.

His language is as revelatory as it is familiar.
He describes himself as a battler against McGovernites, liberal elitists and the media.
He will restore order and middle-class values.
Welcome to Speaker Gingrich's Retro-World.
Mr.
Gingrich has reinvented the political landscape of his youth -- a Sun Belt where politicians communicate in the venerable code words of Barry Goldwater and George Wallace.


Gould's Legacy: Rail Regulation For Another Era
WHEN it comes to battles for corporate control, railroads have provided by far the most colorful contests in American financial history.
They include sagas of shareholders suckered by their president, of bribed judges and legislators, and of takeover efforts flustered by the fact that, for every share the raider could buy, the insiders could print another.
By the standards of the last century, the current battle for control of the Santa Fe railroad is tame.
But the excesses of that era live on in the reactions to it, which created a byzantine regulatory organization so slow that its lethargy has become a major factor in the current battle.

I feel compelled to counter the perspective of "mildness" in the Sept. 25 Coping column, "Checking It Out: A Walk on the Mild Side," by Robert Lipsyte.
As a woman, I do not believe it is possible to saunter obliviously by sex shops or peep shows and, as Mr.

My criticism comes from a different point of view.
I see little in this review to suggest that either Mr.
Browne or the authors understand some basic principles of evolution.

He is seeking more than $3 million in damages for lost pay and other benefits in a civil jury trial that started last week.

A Manhattan With Michelle
WRAPPED in fog and mist, Seattle during the dark season feels like a set from a film noir -- all whispered conspiracies and huddled alliances over strong coffee and thick beer in local hangouts.
For decades, when the seasonal gloom takes hold, people in trench coats and fisherman-quality rain slickers have slipped into an elevator in the Camlin Hotel and pressed a button that causes a blue cloud to light up on the floor indicator.
At the top of the hotel is the Cloud Room -- a piano bar of dark wood and stiff drinks.
Michelle Pfeiffer would have been comfortable here when she played a sultry Seattle lounge singer in "The Fabulous Baker Boys."

A.
Everyone knows New York City has more than its share of faults.
At least two run across upper Manhattan, one along 125th Street and another near Dyckman Street in Inwood.
The last big earthquake in the city was on Aug. 10, 1884.
Equivalent to 5.5 on the Richter scale and centered under New York Harbor, it toppled hundreds of chimneys in the city and woke up chickens in western Pennsylvania.
John Armbruster, a seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., said the next "big one" might not be far away.
"A magnitude 5 hits the New York area about every 100 years," he said.
"This is the longest period known without a magnitude 5 in New York."
And what might a magnitude 5, apparently 10 years overdue, do when it comes?
Mr.
Armbruster said the major skyscrapers in New York, including the older ones like the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, have been built to withstand that kind of shock.
Some other buildings however, especially those built before the age of modern construction techniques, like brownstones, might not fare as well.
Unlike Los Angeles, New York City has no building regulations specifically meant to prevent earthquake damage.
Barriers of Progress
Q.
While walking my dog in Riverside Park, I've noticed very sturdy barriers -- about chest high and built from two-by-four's -- around a lot of the trees.
I've seen smaller versions in dog runs and in other parks, but these are much more forbidding.
Why are they there?
A.
Well, it has nothing to do with your dog.
The presence of these large barriers usually means that there's a capital works project somewhere in the area, said Parke Spencer, director of public information for the Parks Department.
The department makes the barriers big enough to protect trees from asphalt trucks and other heavy equipment.
The barriers also provide protective skirts around the bases of trees, where roots might be damaged.
While they are not attractive, the department says the barriers are effective in minimizing harm to trees.
And like most projects, they are temporary.
Out of (but in) Business
Q.
Has a midtown "going out of business" retailer ever actually gone out of business?
Is there a city "going out of business" license, and how long is it good for?
How much is the fine for having a "going out of business" sale without a permit?
A.
A license to go out of business?
In New York, yes.
The Department of Consumer Affairs issues licenses to failing businesses that give them 30 days to hold closing sales and shut up shop (with the option for two 30-day renewals).
The move to begin licensing these merchants came after consumers complained about nonstop farewells, with inflated prices instead of the expected bargains.
Electronics stores on Fifth Avenue in midtown were particularly blatant, said Pat Cohen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Consumer Affairs.
"People would open with a going-out-of-business sale," she said.
Businesses that violate the terms of the license or restock their merchandise can be fined up to $100 a day, though Ms.
Cohen admits that checking for restocking is difficult.
Under a 1982 law, the Department of Consumer Affairs can close businesses that violate its permits, so long-term "going out of business" businesses could, eventually, find themselves closed for real.
Although midtown is full of stores that are faking failure, Ms.
Cohen says progress is being made.
"Word has gotten around," she said.
"There's fewer of these places than 10 years ago."
Complaints about chronic closers can be made to the Department of Consumer Affairs, (212) 487-4398.

A Gal and Two Guys
AT the beginning of "Fighting Over Beverley," one would think that Israel Horovitz were concocting a fairy tale for elderly lovers, but don't be fooled.
At 69, Archie Bennett has traveled from England to Gloucester, Mass., for the hand of Beverley Shimma who ditched him 49 years ago to run off with Zelly Shimma, a decorated World War II officer.
Beverley made a terrible mistake doing that, Archie tells her.
"Enough is enough, isn't it?" he asks, pleading with Beverley to leave Zelly to start fresh, to reignite an old flame.

Deadly Gifts to Greece and Turkey
In recent years U.S. arms have poured into Greece and Turkey, making them two of the biggest recipients of America's lethal largesse.
The United Nations arms registry reveals that in 1992 and 1993 the U.S. turned over 1,163 tanks and 23 combat aircraft to Greece and 1,509 tanks, 54 fighter planes and 28 heavily armed attack helicopters to Turkey.
All of these weapons were slated for reduction under the 1990 treaty on conventional forces in Europe.
Instead of scrapping them, the Pentagon is giving them away.

Seeing Is Believing: The Cat in the Hat Comes Back


The Sublime, the Modern and the Literal in Views of the Land
IN the Neuberger Museum at Purchase College, it is all landscape -- painted, drawn, printed and photographed or else implied by sculpture.
The show, titled "Inspired by Nature," may not be a survey, but it covers a lot of ground with 80 works by 53 artists, many of them polar opposites, like Thomas Cole and Alex Katz, Raoul Hague and Louis Eilshemius.
Dr.
Lucinda H. Gedeon, director of the museum, and Cornelia Butler, its curator of contemporary art, made the selection, drawing for the most part on the Neuberger's own collection and dividing the results into categories.

Time and 'The Shadow Box'
Michael Cristofer was 32 when his play "The Shadow Box," about three terminally ill patients and the people close to them, won a 1977 Tony Award and the Pulitzer Prize.

"It was never about death," Mr.
Cristofer said, relaxing in the downstairs lobby at Circle in the Square on Broadway, where a revival of "The Shadow Box" opens next Sunday.
"It's about families -- what family is, who you end up with."


A Simple Song That Lives Beyond Time
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE suicide of Kurt Cobain, lead singer of the rock band Nirvana, last April, MTV broadcasted almost continuously an hourlong "Unplugged" special that the band had recorded the previous fall.
The final song on the program was unexpected: it was the only one not previously recorded by Nirvana or even written by an alternative rocker.
Called "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," it had the cadences of an old ballad or blues tune and lyrics that Mr.
Cobain's deathly rasp made absolutely haunting.
In fact, the song was a folk song, usually known as "In the Pines," which dates back at least to the 1870's.
Its appearance in the repertory of a Seattle grunge singer is only the latest chapter in its complex history. (An album of Nirvana's MTV concert, "Unplugged in New York," was recently released on the DGC label.) Those who have recorded the song include the folk legends Leadbelly, Joan Baez and Pete Seeger, the country pioneers Bill Monroe and Chet Atkins, the rockers Sir Douglas Quintet and Duane Eddy, the pop vocalist Connie Francis and the jazz saxophonist Clifford Jordan.

Word for Word/Euthanasia; Helping a Man Kill Himself, As Shown on Dutch TV
THE movement in the United States to allow mercy killing -- Dr.
Jack Kevorkian is its most controversial exponent -- reached a milestone last week when voters in Oregon approved the nation's first law allowing doctors to hasten death for the terminally ill.
The law takes effect Dec. 8, and doctors following its guidelines cannot be prosecuted if they prescribe a lethal dose of drugs to terminally ill patients who request it.
At least two doctors must first agree that the patient has six months or less to live, and the patient must ask three times, the last time in writing.
Doctors have to wait 15 days before meeting the final request for a lethal prescription.


2 Plans to House Elderly Opposed by Neighbors

More Than One Way to See Art
FOR MUCH OF THIS CENTURY, there has been one way of looking at contemporary art, and that is the way the Museum of Modern Art does it -- on right-angled white walls in evenly lighted, shadowless spaces within a highly controlled sequence of rooms.
But a growing number of architects are resisting what they regard as restrictive spaces that limit viewers to a single position in front of an object.
One architect weary of what he calls the missionary position is Wolfgang Prix, who has designed -- among many other art projects -- studios for Anselm Kiefer, a painter who climbs ladders, lies prone and stands on his head to "test" his compositions.
Two weeks ago, when Queen Beatrix opened the Groninger Museum of Art in Groningen, the Netherlands, Mr.
Prix, its designer, led her on catwalks through a turbulent landscape of tilted and angled walls that afford more than one way to see a painting.

Behind the Macy Thanksgiving Parade
REMOVED from this city's trendy boutiques and sidewalk cafes is a warehouse, a former factory where once Tootsie Rolls trundled off an assembly line.
Today the only clue of what might lie behind the building's massive roll-up door is some scattered confetti on the ground.
But come Thanksgiving morning, just after midnight, the building's contents will be revealed when the large pulleys crank open the door of the 45-foot-high workroom and out will roll a convoy of floats and folded balloons headed to New York City.
By 9 A.M., that day it is expected some two million people will line up to be bedazzled as the re-assembled convoy winds its way through the canyons of the city, while another 35 million will watch on television.

THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: Cuomo, a Mystery in an Enigma in a Politician, and His Final Race; Friends Look for an Answer
After all the years in which the riddle about Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo was why he didn't (run for President, take a Supreme Court nomination), the question that lingers after his defeat is why he did (run for a fourth term that it was clear he would have a hard time winning).
The short answer is that the Governor, reluctant to withdraw from the fray after a third term in which a recession had sapped his popularity and forced him to manage scarcity, saw running again as the best way to secure a legacy that already loomed as too intangible, and thus end on a high note.


In Houston, The Symphony Reclaims Its Past
A USIC CRITIC BORN AND raised in Houston, as I was, constantly bumps up against the assumption that anyone so marooned, beyond the pale of the northern culture belt, could have had no early opportunity to hear first-rate performances of symphonic music.
Yet during my childhood and adolescence, the Houston Symphony Orchestra was led successively by Ferenc Fricsay, Sir Thomas Beecham, Leopold Stokowski, Sir John Barbirolli and Andre Previn.
What orchestra in the United States, or Europe for that matter, can boast a more lustrous lineage than that?
True, by the mid-80's, under the leadership of Sergiu Comissiona, the Houston Symphony was playing indifferently and was on the verge of dropping from the top tier of regional orchestras into sheer mediocrity.
But in 1988, Christoph Eschenbach, then better known as a concert pianist than as a conductor, was appointed music director, and by all accounts he has transformed the orchestra, which is said by some to be playing at the highest technical and interpretive levels of its 81-year history.
New Yorkers may judge for themselves when Mr.
Eschenbach and the Houston Symphony perform at Carnegie Hall on Thursday evening.


There's a Wall In the New Berlin; You Just Can't See It
THE Berlin wall came down on Nov. 9, 1989, for the same reason it went up on Aug. 13, 1961: to keep the people of East Germany from running away from Communism.
It worked only too well.


Anticrime Tactic: Shut Footbridge
The 103d Street footbridge, the only direct pedestrian access from Manhattan to Wards Island, will be closed in mid-December as an experiment in crime prevention, officials from the police, the Parks and Recreation Department and the Department of Transportation say.
The closure is waiting only for workers to finish the bridge's latest coat of green paint.
Plans are to reopen the bridge in early spring, though there is no exact date.
Allan J. Fromberg, a Transportation Department spokesman, said the closing would last "as long as the police and the Parks Department deemed necessary."


WESTCHESTER GUIDE
19TH CAT SHOW
Ailurophiles will be converging on the County Center in White Plains next weekend for the Westchester Cat Show, lured by the sheer size and scope of this 19-year-old event.
More than 250 felines, including 30 champion breeds, will participate, competing for ribbons and championship points.
As always, the plain old Archie and Mehitabel type cat without portfolio is eligible for the Household Pet Competition, based on looks and a certain je ne sais quoi.
There will be cats and kittens for sale, and cats and kittens cared for in shelters will be available for adoption.
Judges, breeders and lecturers will dispense information and advice about cats, and lots of vendors of cat-related merchandise will have suggestions for gift giving.


Nov. 6-12; The News, Virtually
A newspaper strike that began Nov. 1 has not quite shut down The San Francisco Examiner and The San Francisco Chronicle.
Within hours of the strike, both sides in the labor dispute had created electronic versions of their own newspapers on the the World Wide Web portion of the Internet.
Striking editors, reporters and columnists of both papers joined to form The San Francisco Free Press, while the both management teams used news agency reports to send out news and photos through a service called The San Francisco Gate.

Penn State, 21 Down, Saves Its Season in Last 0:57
There was more than roses at stake.
Much more than that was slipping away in the windblown mist of Memorial Stadium.
Penn State's perfect season, and any hope of a national championship, was in jeopardy with time running out.
From the start of the day, when a power failure threw Penn State's hotel into darkness and its pre-game preparation into disarray and two early turnovers allowed Illinois to build a stunning 21-point lead, so much was going wrong for the Nittany Lions at the worst possible time.


Rhodes
To the Editor: That was a terribly unfair portrait of Rhodes.
Methinks that Ms.
Spano's experience there must have been a projection of her sour mood, maintained as a result of the frustration of her plans.
Admittedly, traveling around the Greek islands requires some resiliency, as well as an aquiescence to both the laws of nature and the quirky scheduling of ferries.
Personally, I found Rhodes to be a delight, a real potpourri of everything Greece has to offer.
The city, to me, had the flavor of a capsule Paris, without wide boulevards or plazas.
The stores contained an excellent array of goods.
I bought a bronze chess set there, with figures from Greek history and myths, that is now one of my most prized possessions.
And all else was glorious: the Valley of the Butterflies, the Castle of the Counts, the Temple of Diana on its promontory overlooking the sea and a delightful white town that Ms.
Spano can only denigrate because of the large number of tourists.


SUNDAY, November 13. 1994; Bug Bijoux
Charlie Hines has designed a jewelry line that Morticia would love.
It features dead insects encased in beads of acrylic resin.
"When I was a kid in the late 1970's, I began wondering how they suspended insects in paperweights," says Hines, the creator of Bedebug.
"Twenty years later, I figured it out."


HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL
C.H.S.F.L.
OPPOSITES ATTRACT: CHAMINADE and ST.
ANTHONY'S advanced to the Catholic High School Football League's AAA Finals with playoff victories yesterday at St.
John's University.
Although both teams looked impressive, they won in completely different fashions.
In the first game, Chaminade edged ST.
FRANCIS PREP, 10-7, in a classic defensive battle.
The second game, featured last year's champion, St.
Anthony's, which outscored MONSIGNOR FARRELL, 37-20, in an offensive slugfest.


World Markets; Moderation Plays Well in Johannesburg
THE clunk of discarded Marxist baggage has been audible all year on the floor of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
The market is enjoying the sound of the African National Congress of President Nelson Mandela chucking its more radical economic notions.
The latest example came Oct. 29 when Thabo Mbeki, one of South Africa's two deputy presidents, reversed the A.N.C.'s traditional commitment to state ownership.
He revealed that the Government may privatize such state-owned companies as Eskom, which generates half the electricity produced in sub-Saharan Africa, Transnet, a transportation conglomerate that owns South African Airways, and Telkom, the telecommunications company.


Capturing a New Sense of Freedom in Eastern Europe
THE walk-up apartment in which Mark Sadan lives here is not quite the artist's garret of "La Boheme," but the ambiance comes close.
After climbing to what was once the attic of an old house, guests are asked to remove their shoes and step into a pair of waiting slippers -- a custom that Mr.
Sadan, a photographer, said he adopted after visiting the Far East.


Orange Glow In the East
FOR many visitors to Berlin today, the neighborhoods in the formerly Communist east hold a special attraction.
Buildings are being renovated, museums reinvigorated and houses painted, repaired and tidied up.
But there are frustratingly few places where one can escape the feverish pace of construction, not to mention the bitter wind, and find a moment of peace and warmth.
One inviting place is Cafe Orange, which is close to some of the former East Berlin's most famous attractions.
Next door is the newly rebuilt synagogue, its gold-patterned dome once again resplendent.
The Postfuhramt, once the central post office and a gem of 19th-century architecture, stands on the corner.
Nearby are the Pergamon Museum, noted for its Greek and Babylonian collections, and Unter den Linden, the handsome boulevard that has been a center of Berlin life for centuries.


Play Nice. Play Tough.
President Clinton is getting a lot of free advice about how to deal with Tuesday's election disaster.
Most of it is telling him to abandon his left-wing agenda and rediscover the inner moderate who propelled him to victory in 1992.
Bipartisan accommodation should be his goal, it is said.
This isn't completely wrong, but there are three problems with it.
First, the notion that Mr.
Clinton ran as a moderate "new Democrat" and then has governed as some kind of McGovernite left-winger is mostly the product of Republican agitprop and lazy journalists' shorthand.
The most familiar items in the indictment -- his top-bracket tax increase, his proposal to overhaul the health care system, homosexuals in the military -- were all things he clearly promised in the campaign.


Olympic Rentals
When hotel rooms in Lillehammer, Norway, grew scarce during this year's Winter Olympics, local residents rented out their homes.
An Atlanta entrepreneur has already organized a network of home rentals for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
Bob Buchan, president of Event Management and Travel, expects around 10,000 private homes to be available for the 18-day event.
Maid service will also be available at an added cost.
Prospective renters can look at slides or videos supplied by property owners.
Average price is about $200 a night for each bedroom.

Army Lets It Slip Away, And Boston U. Cashes In
After trailing Army, 6-0, at the half, Boston University scored three second-half touchdowns to beat the Cadets, 21-12, before a crowd of 33,762 at Michie Stadium.
The Cadets had hoped for better, and before the game -- at least on paper -- it looked as if they might deserve it.
Coming into today's game against the Terriers, Army, a Division I-A school, had won only three games, and two of the victories had been over Division I-AA teams, Holy Cross and The Citadel.


New Paris Rail Station Is Link to Major Cities
A new stop on France's rail network is about to be added at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, making it possible for air travelers to connect to cities throughout France and Europe.

It allows passengers to go directly to Lyons, Avignon, Nice and Lille via high-speed TGV trains that bypass Paris.

LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
Plugged In
MAYTAG was more popular than Mario for some voters in the 4th Election District in Valley Stream.
Their polling place featured the latest in washers, along with voting booths.
Forget spin doctors.
These voters were checking out spin cycles.
Since the 1950's the residents of the 4th E.D. have voted in the Granado Appliance Center on Merrick Road.
"It works out good," one voter, Richard Ammann of Valley Stream, said.
"While I was waiting I saw a TV stand I need. Last year I picked up a microwave. What could you get if you voted in a school, pencils?"


Class of '95: What's New, Improved or Laid to Rest
The average car on America's street is getting somewhat long in the tooth - from an average of 5.6 years in 1968, for example, to 8.1 years in 1992.
This graying of the consumer demand, and both dealers and manufacturers expect 1995 new-vehicle sales to outpace the record levels of 1994.
Straining to meet the demand, auto makers are pushing their manufacturing capacity to the limit.
With the market booming, many car companies are venturing into new segments.


To Dance In Veracruz
IN Veracruz, everyone dances.
When I close my eyes on the city, a deep, methodical drumbeat throbs without flagging and everyone is in motion, from little boys gently guided by older girls to ancients like the decrepit woman I saw in the zocalo who put aside her tray of Chiclets and plastic doodads to dance with an equally old man in a shiny-elbowed suit jacket.
Her face transformed, she moved with great spirit, hips in subtle motion, loose and comfortably graceful, her shoulders perfectly still.
When she stopped to pick up her burden again and released her partner to the shaky gait in which he apparently lives his nondancing life, it was clear that "danzon," the very sober and formal dance favored by Veracruzanos, had held them upright as long as the music lasted.


For Warhol, 15 More Minutes
The Baltimore Museum of Art has opened its New Wing for Modern Art with an exhibition of 15 newly acquired paintings by Andy Warhol in the Caplan Family Gallery, which has a total of 42 Warhol works.
This acquisition, announced last May, makes the museum home to the second-largest collection of Warhol paintings on regular public display, after the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.
The 16 galleries in the 35,000-square-foot addition, which opened last month, house the museum's permanent collection of 20th-century art.
More than 75 American and European artists of the post-1945 period are represented in the wing, including Willem de Kooning, Helen Frankenthaler, Jenny Holzer, Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg and Frank Stella.
The Warhol paintings are shown in the central main-floor gallery.
Works in less traditional media, and with more contemporary form and content, are contained in the upper-floor galleries.


Heartwarming Fare for the Fall Table
BRAISED rabbit, pappardelle in a wild boar sauce and venison chops with a red-currant glaze signal fall as much as turning leaves and ripening gourds.
This heartwarming seasonal fare stands out on the autumn menu at Pentimento.
More than the menu is decked out for fall at Pentimento, which opened in the summer in quarters in Stony Brook once occupied by Franzi &amp; Nell's and, before that, by Pasta Viola.
Pots of mums in shades of copper, brass and bronze fill a bay window.
Fresh flowers and tiny pumpkins adorn the tables.
Walls are sponge painted in soft gold, the color of creamy pumpkin bisque.


[ APPEARANCES ] ; The Resistance Movement
THE OTHER DAY THE COLLAGEN Corporation invited some writers and editors to a presentation by Debbie Then, a social psychologist from Stanford University who gave a talk on women's new attitudes toward "cosmetic procedures," meaning anything from chemical peels to collagen injections to surgery.
We saw a video of attractive (but not flashy) women talking openly and positively about how they'd had work done to please themselves, and how much happier and more confident they felt afterward.
These women didn't look old and they didn't look young; they had the smooth look of affluence.
According to Then's survey, women who elect to have cosmetic procedures are trend-setters.
Heroines of consumerism, they'd been the first to equip themselves with VCR's and cellular phones.
One member of the audience objected to the cost -- $400 for collagen injections that in some cases might have to be redone every four months.
She didn't mention surgery, which could easily run as high as $8,000, none of it covered by health insurance.
Nobody from the Collagen Corporation said anything about trying to bring down the price.
But then no one would ever consider bringing down the price of a Prada backpack, either.
Wasn't that part of the point, that the ageless face signaled membership in the consumer elite?


Dole Gets Back on Top In Usual Laconic Style
The world here has flipped upside down, and suddenly Bob Dole is on top.
But with the low-key Senator Dole, it can be hard to tell.
"S'pretty good," he muttered into the telephone on Friday from his office in a standard Dole growl of understatement.


No Crystal Ball Needed on Crime
POLITICAL oratory and people's fears notwithstanding, crime is decreasing across the country.
But the drop has less to do with all the get-tough talk than it does with the fact that fewer children were born to American mothers in the 1970's.
Criminologists are sure that in the next decade, crime will rise again to record levels because of the far different demographic trends of the 1980's.
And while no one has easy answers, the near-certainty of demography raises disturbing questions, among them: What can be done for today's troubled toddlers to keep them from becoming criminals a decade from now?


Beware the Kudzu Gang and All Its Kind
This is about outlaws.
Not the gun-toting kind, but the kind with roots, leaves and stems.
Invasive species, the professionals call them, and a rich field of study they offer.
By definition they are the sorts of plants that usurp the territory of others, rampaging out of control.
To many gardeners and landscapers, they seem attractive and worthwhile at first, and are introduced to an area on purpose.
But then reality takes over.
Those who live in Florida know this kind of story well.
The melaleuca tree was introduced from Australia because the tree was known to have considerable water-absorption capabilities.
It sounded like the perfect solution to drain some of what were considered nasty wetlands, and melaleuca trees were planted freely.
Floridians never knew what they were getting into.

New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks
TURNING BACK THE SUN By Colin Thubron.
Harper Perennial, $12.
In an unnamed landscape that resembles Australia, a provincial doctor confronts racism as he attempts to treat a mysterious disease that turns white skin a deep brown.
Drought heightens tensions in the town, whose residents blame the aborigines for their suffering.
In 1992 our reviewer, David Sacks, called this novel "admirable, thought-provoking . . . urgent in its message."


Fresh Herbs Add a Hint of the Exotic to Desserts
MINT is losing its monopoly.
Other fresh green herbs that have long been associated with savory dishes, not sweets, have begun showing up on dessert plates in restaurants.
Chefs have found that some fresh herbs, notably rosemary, tarragon and basil, can provide a lovely, if unexpected, whiff of fragrance and flavor.
Home cooks can easily follow suit.
Why not garnish that apple tart with a sprig of tarragon, crush some rosemary into the lemon sorbet or add basil to an orange custard?

Cornelius Martin, 36, and Stephanie Hairston, 32, teach at Brown Academy, a public middle school in the Clinton Hills section of Newark, N.J., a forbidding, rundown neighborhood.
"The homes are neat inside, but the buildings are falling apart," said Miss Hairston, who teaches seventh grade.
"There's drugs in the stairwells, people getting shot and stabbed in the elevators. The violence goes on and on."
Mr.
Martin, who teaches special education at the school and is a co-pastor at the neighborhood's Unity Freedom Baptist Church, added, "It's so rough that the nursery school is in the police precinct."


The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
I come from Ashkenazi Jewish stock and, not surprisingly, do better than most people on standardized tests.
Also not surprisingly (I suspect), I do less well than many people at, among other things, giving parties, playing basketball and making money.
Finally, I am a biology professor in a prestigious college.
Like most of my colleagues, I am increasingly encountering "learning disabled" students in my classrooms.
I have also spent time teaching in urban precollege settings.
Several weeks ago, I taught some classes in a Chapter 1 middle school, Chapter 1 being the designation of a school for children who score substantially less well than most on standardized exams.

The Future Governor And the One He Beat
Pressed for anecdotes about the colorful side of the man chosen to lead 18 million New Yorkers, friends are -- well, pressed.
They offer words like "plain," with no stigma attached.
Indeed, Governor-elect George E. Pataki seems to have cultivated just such an image.
As for the man he will succeed, associates say Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo is, if not plain, perhaps less complex than he is often portrayed.
Still, they wonder at some of the choices he made and chances he passed up.

At Work; A Fond Farewell to Big Government
THE message of the Democratic debacle last week, Washington pundits tell us, is that America dislikes Bill Clinton and hates liberalism and its evil twin, Big Government.
This may be so.
Certainly, inhabitants of the liberal sanctuaries accustomed to being out of step with the rest of the country are asking themselves how many times in one life they will have to ponder moving to Canada.
For now they are just pulling raincoats tight around their "Great Society counter-cultural McGovern-ik" T-shirts and poring over David McCullough's "Truman," looking for nuggets that might help the First Boomer.
President Clinton may be no liberal's idea of a liberal, but in the Damien-gone-respectable context of Newt Gingrich, even to the die-hards in Berkeley, Cambridge and New York, he must now look pretty good.
Is it churlish to note that many of the people who say they feel burdened by Big Government are in a position to be so because they, or their parents and grand-parents, were its principal beneficiaries?
Collective memory is an Etch-a-Sketch, easily erased.
Barely 60 years have passed since the Government's response to the Great Depression reshaped the American social compact, redistributing wealth and creating opportunities for the dispossessed and disenfranchised, or as the phrase of the time put it, "one third of the nation." True, as liberal critics would point out, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal missed a lot of people but it did put the "upward" back in mobility for millions of Americans.
It also set a standard for government activism -- particularly in protecting the rights of workers -- that lasted until it ran into a stone wall called Reagan.


Journal; The Mother Next Door
How could she do it?
That was the question Americans asked incessantly upon hearing of Susan Smith's confession, as if its constant repetition, in the most shocked tones we could summon, would somehow keep us at a safe distance from a mother's most heinous crime.
But try as we might to suppress the ugly thoughts, they leapt up anyway.
In truth, we already know the answer to our own question -- no matter how incredulously we keep asking it.
Anyone who has ever felt rage -- at a child, a parent, a spouse, a vanished lover -- has at least entertained the fantasy of losing control, even if only in the involuntary form of a nightmare.
We feel the horror of Susan Smith's crime not because it's unimaginable but precisely because we can imagine it.
And once we do, we are left nervously contemplating the thin line that separates the unhinged few who act on such impulses from those of us who do not.


Commercial Property/Fifth Avenue; A Banking Corner Tries on a New Wardrobe
IN A MOVE that strengthens the renewed growth of middle-level retailing on Fifth Avenue in the mid-40's, Today's Man, the off-price clothing chain, is to open its third Manhattan superstore outlet next spring in the vacant former bank branch at 529 Fifth Avenue.
The two-level, 25,000-square-foot storefront site on the southeast corner of 44th Street, was vacated in 1989 by Bankers Trust.
Part of the space was leased to Chemical Bank in May 1991, but Chemical closed its A.T.M. branch there almost a year ago as a result of its merger with Manufacturers Hanover Trust.

Albany Seeks Managed Care for Mentally Ill On Medicaid
In an effort to provide better, more reliable community-based care for people with psychiatric disorders, New York State says it will seek to create a managed-care network for 35,000 of the state's most seriously mentally ill who are covered by Medicaid.
Under the program, which would require a Federal Medicaid waiver, patients who enroll in the network would lose the freedom of choice they now enjoy.
But in return they would be assigned to a single mental-health provider, like a hospital or nonprofit agency, and would be guaranteed access to special housing programs, social workers and outpatient services.

A Brooklyn Co-op Tries Acting Like a Condo
A CENTRAL goal of many co-op apartment buildings in New York City is to build up the level of owner-occupancy.
These are buildings that are owned by co-op corporations but are largely occupied by long-term rental tenants.
The collapse of the market for these apartments throughout the city in the late 80's and early 90's has caused financial problems for owner-residents and conversion sponsors and may even threaten the quality of housing and housing services.

Battered but Unbowed, a Maestro Rebounds
HOW QUICKLY HAS Franz Welser-Most, a 34-year-old Austrian with a complicated personal history, risen to the top tier of international maestros?
A scant 10 years ago, he was the principal conductor of the Austrian Youth Orchestra, scarcely known outside his homeland.
He has already announced his resignation in 1996 from his first position as music director of a major orchestra, the London Philharmonic.
He takes up a similar post next season at the Zurich Opera, having conducted only 12 operas (at prestigious houses, to be sure).
Perhaps most remarkable, Mr.
Welser-Most, now in demand at leading American orchestras as well as the Berlin Philharmonic, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, the Bavarian Radio Symphony and the Salzburg Festival, has yet to conduct several of the concert staples stockpiled by every budding maestro, like Dvorak's "New World" Symphony.


Up From Propaganda
IN a macabre way, the murder of Dmitri Kholodovthe 27-year-old reporter who was blown up in his newsroom by a booby-trapped briefcase -- testifies to the influence and impact of the Russian press these days, as it struggles honorably to do its job in a rather lawless time.
Mr.
Kholodov was investigating corruption in the Russian military, and someone obviously judged his work for Moskovsky Komsomolets to be extremely threatening.
He is the third Russian journalist to have been killed this year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and many more have been injured or assaulted, sometimes by the police.
Vladislav A. Starkov, editor of the mass circulation newspaper Argumenty i Fakty, puts an optimist's face on this news when he says, "If the press were not influential, these things wouldn't happen."

Sam Shepard, Storyteller
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN the East and West Coasts, at least part of "Simpatico," one of the season's most anticipated plays, was written in a moving truck by its driver.
That's Sam Shepard, who says he believes "all good writing comes out of aloneness." And you're not too likely to be interrupted driving along an Interstate.
"You have to do it on an open highway," explains the playwright during a lunch break for rehearsals of the drama, which opens tonight at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, with Mr.
Shepard directing.
"You wouldn't want to do it in New York City. But on Highway 40 West or some of those big open highways, you can hold the wheel with one hand and write with the other.

Recently, my daughter, Carly, 11 months, began to wake and cry at night.
Our pediatrician said that Carly, too, needed to be Ferberized.
The technique works just as well now as it did then.

Nov. 6-12; At a Snail's Pace
North Korea sent ripples of anxiety through Asia last Wednesday when Pyongyang radio reported that an important announcement was imminent.
With rumors flying of grave political developments, the Government made its disclosure: the leadership had ordered the construction of a new bridge and tunnel in Pyongyang.
The report provoked nervous, but inadvertently or not it carried a pithy message about the changes slowly working on the divided Korean peninsula.
After two years of confrontations over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program, the agreement reached with the United States last month just might have turned the focus in the desperately poor North from bombs to economic development.


'The Living' Recalls The Bubonic Plague
IT doesn't take a mind reader to figure out that "The Living," a play about the bubonic plague in 17th-century London, is not just a play about that.
The playwright, Anthony Clarvoe, has euphemisms to spare.
A "concerned neighbor" is really the local doomsayer who decrees that a patient has dropsy, apoplexy -- or has "fallen ill" with the nameless fatal affliction.


From Our 'Get a Life' Department
To the Editor:
With reference to "The Good Life After Goldman" (Oct. 16), am I supposed to admire these three individuals because at long last they've discovered there's more to life than making money?
Let's face it, these are mediocre people with mediocre minds, but because they've made a lot of money, they are noticed (and they get special treatment).
I suggest you follow up this article with others in a similar vein, and make it a regular feature entitled "Life Styles of the Rich and Self-Indulgent." DAVID JUNKER  San Francisco, Oct. 16


Shoulder Pain Sidelines Jeter
DEREK JETER's rapid ascent to the majors has hit a minor snag as the Yankees announced yesterday that the 20-year-old shortstop had been removed from the Arizona Fall League because of a shoulder injury.
Jeter, who played in 154 games in four leagues this season, had complained of soreness in his right shoulder since last month and Dr.
STUART HERSHON examined him Wednesday and detected minor inflammation.


Now, a Live Report From Somebody or Other
THEY TURN UP ON EVERY local newscast in the country: reporters speaking live at the faraway scene of a natural disaster, a plane crash, a big criminal case.
They look and sound exactly like the reporters from the local station, even to the point of finishing their reports with the familiar sign-off, "Back to you in the studio."
But there's one difference.
No one in that city has ever seen them covering the fire downtown or the children's Christmas pageant at Our Lady of Perpetual Help School.
There's a good reason for that.
These reporters do not work for the local affiliate.
They are instead a new breed of television newsperson: generic reporters.


2 Inventive Women Targeting Youths
THE telephone next to Carol Coleman's bed rings at 2 A.M., waking her from a sound sleep.
A caller from Idaho or Iowa or Maine asks her to "play 'Misty' for me." Ms.
Coleman is not a disk jockey; she is an entrepreneur and mother of three children who has chosen to run a business out of her home -- a balancing act that can be a bit chaotic and full of surprises.
Ms.
Coleman has an 800 number to help with this business, which she and another resident, Anne Herman, started in 1991 and, unfortunately, the number closely resembles the number for the request line of a radio station with a wide broadcast range.


Sports of The Times; The Tyson, Olajuwon Connection
AS sports' new odd couple, it's as if they're living in different apartments but with the same landLord: Hakeem Olajuwon, the towering basketball player, and Mike Tyson, the jailed boxer.
Early last week, Olajuwon was contacted at his Barakaat Holdings office in Houston by some of Tyson's people.


Shopping Center Threatens An Avenue Worth Saving
To the Editor:
The groundbreaking for the Atlantic Center in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, has passed, but one issue involving the huge complex, anchored by a 60,000-square-foot Pathmark, remains unresolved.
The people of South Portland Avenue are still threatened by the plan to designate this narrow, residential street ("avenue" is a misnomer) as the only two-way thoroughfare for the entire project.
This guarantees that we would be inundated by around-the-clock truck and car traffic.


Cashing Checks
To the Editor: My wife and I recently went on a trip to Germany and the Netherlands.
Before we went we purchased Dutch guilders and German marks from a local bank.
We also purchased considerable American Express traveler's checks in German marks.
Once we arrived in Hamburg, we were dismayed to find that it was very difficult to cash the traveler's checks.
Restaurants and shops would not take them.
Most banks, including a Citibank, would not cash them.
We cashed one at a Postal Exchange at a 12 percent discount.


Is 3-D Imax the Future or Another Cinerama?
FOR A HUNDRED YEARS, THE cinema and technology have been locked in a tight embrace.
Sometimes the relationship has been a case of misguided passion.
Believe it or not, Smell-o-vision once seemed pretty sexy.
At other times, infatuation blossomed into love and marriage.
Sound and color swept cinema off its feet, and the change was permanent.
Big-screen 3-D has been an on-again, off-again affair.
For the moment, it's on again.
On Friday, Sony will open the doors to a new theater complex on the Upper West Side of Manhattan that will include 12 traditional theaters and, as its crown jewel, a theater that will use 480 of its 600 seats to show 3-D Imax films on a screen 80 feet tall.
It will be the first commercial 3-D Imax theater in the United States.


TAKING HAITI
Alex Webb's photograph of the United States Army's "invasion" of Haiti, with soldiers in full battle gear, and the cameramen in the line of fire to get the best picture, will be ranked as a classic of the 1990's -- alongside pictures of the news media following the O. J. Simpson Bronco chase ("Taking Haiti," Oct. 23).
However, journalists should use the correct adjectives when describing these events.
The invasion was in reality an excursion, and the Bronco chase was more like a procession.

Nov. 6-12; Holding onto Their Land


Streetscapes/Harperly Hall; Restoring an Arts and Crafts Co-op Masterpiece
THERE are two ways to restore a building: Establish a big budget and spend it all at once, or undertake separate projects a little at a time over years, even decades.
The co-op shareholders at Harperly Hall, a 1911 Arts and Crafts masterpiece at 64th Street and Central Park West, have chosen the second path, and the history of their 11-year effort demonstrates the patience -- and money -- that a complicated building can require.
In 1909, a group headed by the architect Henry Wilhelm Wilkinson bought the northwest corner of 64th Street and Central Park West to build a co-op "suitable for artists' studios," according to their corporate papers.

Churches Raise Funds By Staying in Touch
To the Editor:
Those who raise funds for churches have recognized for years that people give greater support to organizations they are more familiar with and with which they are more involved (news article, Nov. 6).
However, your article never mentions a primary difference between the Assemblies of God and the Roman Catholic Church.


Margaret F. Mudd, Fulvio V. Dobrich
Margaret Farris Mudd, a managing director in the emerging markets division of Chemical Bank, was married yesterday to Fulvio Vladimir Dobrich, a founder and the owner of DLF Inc., specialists in the trading of international debt obligations.
Both work in New York.
The Rev.

The bride, 39, is a graduate of Manhattanville College.
She is a daughter of Vivienne Crichton Mudd and Robert Clayton Mudd of St.
Louis.
Her father, a career diplomat, retired from the State Department. .

The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
A few days after you published Malcolm W. Browne's quite favorable review of three new books that attribute intelligence primarily to genetic factors, I came across a discussion of intelligence testing in William Broad and Nicholas Wade's 1982 book, "Betrayers of the Truth." Mr.
Broad and Mr.
Wade list "three cardinal principles" for the use of intelligence tests, as laid down by the tests' inventor, Alfred Binet: "Binet's Rule 1 was: The scores do not define anything innate or permanent. Rule 2: The scale is a rough guide for identifying and helping learning-disabled children; it is not a way of measuring normal children. Rule 3: Low scores don't mean a child is innately incapable."


DUMBING DOWN
The bell curve is certainly a slippery slope these days.
Robin Marantz Henig's Hers column ("Dumbing Down," Oct. 23) illustrates, in a variety of ways, the kind of black-and-white thinking that passes for discourse on education.
While it is possible for schools to hold back quicker learners through poorly planned heterogeneous grouping, it is equally possible to create narrowly focused students by accelerating their achievement in homogeneous groups.


Agreement in San Francisco Newspaper Strike
San Francisco's bitter and sometimes violent newspaper strike appeared near an end as management and a conference of eight unions announced a tentative agreement early today.
Members of the unions are expected to meet on Sunday to ratify the proposed five-year pact.
Union officials said they expected that the two newspapers affected by the strike, The Chronicle and The Examiner, would be published with union labor early next week in their full sizes and at full circulations.
The strike was the first at the papers in 25 years.


Now Come the Holidays: Discomfort or Joy?
THE elections are over, so let's get serious. We are entering . . . the HOLIDAY ZONE.
"My busiest time," said Caryl Ehrlich, who is a one-on-one counselor for people with eating disorders and other habits they want to change.
"There's such fantasy about the holidays. We think that everyone else is surrounded by loving family while we're alone in our isolation and depression. Especially here in the city, where so many of us came to do what we wanted, and to hide our loneliness.


The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
In response to Malcolm W. Browne's review of books on race and I.Q., Will Pflaum has written a letter to The Times Book Review that was also distributed on the E-mail network of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society, a discussion group composed mainly of evolutionary scientists.
Mr.
Pflaum repudiates racial groupings as they appear in "Race, Evolution, and Behavior" and "The Bell Curve," and also demands a fully worked-out theoretical rationale for racial differences before we even begin to consider the empirical evidence.


BENNINGTON MEANS BUSINESS
There is a dimension that is missing from your intriguing examination of Bennington College and its president, Elizabeth Coleman.
Your photographs played a phalanx of sympathetic-looking former faculty members against a stark, "the cheese stands alone" portrait of an embattled administrator.
But there is another side of Coleman, as an educator.
I attended the freshman-year program at the New School for Social Research in 1972, when Coleman was both the program's dean and my most challenging teacher.
In her art of fiction seminar, she taught with passion and intensity.
She was demanding and always engaged.


Anti-Indonesia Protest at U.S. Embassy
In an incident that raises questions about the security of American diplomatic outposts, 29 unarmed demonstrators climbed over a fence into the United States Embassy compound here on Saturday and have refused to leave in a protest of Indonesia's policies in East Timor.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said at a news briefing on Saturday that Washington has "no plans to throw them out."


A Chef's Sure Hand, French Style
IN 1986, when we first found Ondine in Danbury, it was just beginning to hum, striving to overcome an edge-of-town location and the reputation of previous businesses that had occupied the premises.
In spite of these handicaps it was obvious that Dieter Thiel, the chef-owner of Ondine, knew how to cook.
The question was, would he persevere?
Now, eight years later, Ondine is not just humming, it sings lustily, in its food, menu and atmosphere.
The decor now evokes memories of French country inns: fresh flowers, candles, Staffordshire dinnerware, comfortable plush chairs and a green and white rose motif.


Speaking Of the Devil
IF you tromp around Moscow enough in winter, you'll want a bit of deviltry, or at least some decent hot tea.
After you've done Red Square, seen the "smoked fish" (as young Russians call Mr. Lenin's corpse) and become tired of running into other foreigners in the hotels, take a walk through the lovely square around Patriarch's Pond.
Now one of the most desirable neighborhoods in central Moscow, after serving as a kind of Latin Quarter for students in the last century, the square is a good place to relax, read and meet strangers.
On wintry days, there is ice skating.


Trip to Old Trout Haunt Is Bountiful in Waders
Returning to his old haunts, an angler should be prepared for change.
More than 35 years ago, Vic Pomiecko and I decided to fly fish all of the remote trout ponds in west-central New Hampshire, and Cole Pond in Enfield became one of our favorites.
Other anglers visited it so rarely that we began to regard it as our own private preserve.


'Garbage!': Municipal History From the Bottom Up
"THIS discussion . . ." said Mierle Laderman Ukeles, standing under an arch bristling with 6,000 worn-out work gloves.
She paused and looked gently at her audience of half a dozen volunteer tour guides.
"This public discussion, with deep learning that surrounds you, is on the question of," she paused again, choosing her words, "whose city, whose dirt."
"This public discussion" is the latest exhibition at the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue.
For the next three months or so, the library's Gottesman Hall -- with its marble columns and carved wooden ceiling -- will be filled with the sights, sounds and, yes, the smells, of garbage.
That all this tossed-away banality has been done up and gleefully packaged as "Garbage! The History and Politics of Trash in New York City" is no more unlikely than Ms.
Ukeles herself.
She is the artist-in-residence of the city's Sanitation Department, and of the Fresh Kills landfill to boot, and the arch of gloves is her contribution to the show.

Trouble in Paradise, 2 Wide Views; How the Belnord Battle Took Shape Along Classical Lines
In 1975, Thomas Bitullo-Martin attained many a New Yorker's fantasy: an eight-room, rent-stabilized apartment in the Belnord, the landmark Upper West Side apartment house.
His joy at the find lasted three years, until his refrigerator and freezer broke down, touching off 16 years of warfare with his landlady, Lillian Seril.
"She wouldn't fix them, wouldn't let me fix them and wouldn't let me replace them," he said.
"Eventually, she moved up a refrigerator from the basement that was 20 years old, that was rusted and mildewed, that had roaches in it, and it turned out it was short-circuited, too."


On a Peaceful Sound, Memories of Normandy
MOST of the assembling passengers were unaware they were about to board a Green Monster.
After all, it looked like a benign white whale, and it was, in fact, a ferryboat.
But to 42 men at the New London docks, it was the old LST-510 and, like each of them, a survivor of the Normandy invasion at Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944.
For those of its original crew gathered for a 50th reunion, it was the first glimpse of their Green Monster -- and of each other -- in half a century.


Islamic Guard Unit Ousted
Under pressure from a Brooklyn Assemblyman, state housing officials have decided not to renew a building-security contract held by a unit of the Nation of Islam.

Editorial Notebook; A Supreme Court Exhibition
The hype surrounding "Strange Justice," the new book that castigates Clarence Thomas and the Senate committee that confirmed him, has obscured an interesting development: Mr.
Thomas's campaign to bypass his critics by appealing directly to what he seems to view as his natural constituency, the conservative black middle class.
The campaign has been conducted mainly below radar, through private receptions like the one in Chicago for a former welfare mother who put several children through college.
But late last month, Mr.
Thomas convened a more public gathering of 35 African-Americans, including some from the black press, for three hours of off-the-record meetings at the Supreme Court.
The guests were plucked from the Rolodex of the Washington talk-show host Armstrong Williams, one of Justice Thomas's closest friends.
Mr.
Williams invited a select few to a special meeting in the Justice's chambers.
The Thomas camp asserts that race had nothing to do with who was invited to the meetings.
Given what transpired, that is difficult to believe.


Job Goes Unfilled And Youths Suffer
At first, after Kelly Vilar quit her job as Community Board 11's youth coordinator, the spot went unfilled because of a Dinkins administration mandate that laid-off city workers be given hiring preference.
Of the more than 100 people interviewed -- former sanitation workers, former Health Department workers, and former child welfare caseworkers -- none passed muster.
But then, last year, the Department of Youth Services cut financing for the job.
In Catch-22 fashion, the department said, the money was revoked because the position had not been filled.

The Election and the Kremlin
A Republican-dominated Congress in Washington is expected to create new strains in the Russian-American relationship, which is already showing stress as Boris N. Yeltsin's Government moves toward a more centrist, nationalist position at home and abroad.
The shift in Mr.
Yeltsin's stance has been due in large part to his own legislative opposition, which has taken strong nationalist stands on Bosnia, Iraq, NATO and other issues of concern to Washington.


Tough Guy In Love

To see humanity and goodness revealed by a killer in "Pulp Fiction" was certainly not what I expected.

Income and Marriage
To the Editor:
Re "When a Woman Earns Like a Man" (The Week in Review, Nov. 6): According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, women's earnings have risen to 77 percent of men's, significantly more than your 70 percent.
In addition, nearly one-third of working married women earn more than their spouses, another rising proportion.


For Rebel Bosnia Muslisms, Life in Chicken Coops
Where 60,000 chickens once clucked and fed, thousands of Bosnia's ragged dispossessed now mingle in the mud, lugging containers of water and bundles of soiled clothing through a landscape awash with sewage and misery.
They are Bosnian Muslims, these children playing amid stinking piles of garbage, these women crouched in vast chicken coops stirring soup over makeshift fires, these men chopping firewood in the gloom, yet the distinction between their lot and that of animals is not easy to discern.

Fresh Herbs Add a Hint of the Exotic to Desserts
MINT is losing its monopoly.
Other fresh green herbs that have long been associated with savory dishes, not sweets, have begun showing up on dessert plates in restaurants.
Chefs have found that some fresh herbs, notably rosemary, tarragon and basil, can provide a lovely, if unexpected, whiff of fragrance and flavor.
Home cooks can easily follow suit.
Why not garnish that apple tart with a sprig of tarragon, crush some rosemary into the lemon sorbet or add basil to an orange custard?

Just Try Dancing to These Soundtracks
LISTEN to the soundtracks for the movies "Pulp Fiction" (MCA) and "Ed Wood" (Hollywood), and you'll hear something a bit out of the ordinary: dialogue.
And not just a few lines to move the plot along, but entire swaths.
The "Pulp Fiction" soundtrack, besides the music, uses seven clips of dialogue, including some of the most memorable scenes from the movie in full, including gunshots.
The "Ed Wood" soundtrack contains Martin Landau doing Bela Lugosi's monologue from "Bride of the Monster" ("hunted, despised, living like an animal") and other classic and campy scenes.
Perhaps the Ed Wood movie "Plan 9 From Outer Space" (Performance) was more influential than imagined.
Its soundtrack is a complete transcript of the film, with all the so-bad-it's-good dialogue.


The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
Malcolm W. Browne cites Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray's argument that they can prove that intelligence tests are not systematically biased against blacks because "if the S.A.T. is biased against blacks, it will underpredict their college performance." Since their examination of "hundreds of studies" reveals that such tests do correctly predict performance, they conclude that these tests are therefore not biased.


Vietnam: Behind a Red-Tape Curtain
THE big day had finally arrived.
The hotel had set out its finest china and crystal.
There were starched linen napkins around a centerpiece of tiny American and Vietnamese flags.
Everything seemed to be ready for the inaugural meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ho Chi Minh City, the city still remembered by most of these American business people and bankers as Saigon.
It was to be a day of celebration and optimism last April, just three months after President Clinton lifted a 19-year-old American trade embargo on Vietnam.


In America; A Simple Case of Fraud
The beauty of Ronald Reagan, Newt Gingrich and so many other Republicans is that they make it all sound so simple.
If the Republicans can reduce taxes, increase defense spending, balance the budget, get people off welfare, reconstitute the American family and accelerate the current reduction in crime -- if they can do all that -- they deserve to be in power.
God bless them.
They should be running the world.


A Choir in Reunion Sings Schubert Mass
THE 1994-95 season is a time for nostalgia and celebration," says Richard Coffey, who conducted the first concert of the South Church Choral Society in November of 1974, and continues to preside as music director of its successor ensemble, Connecticut Choral Artists (the group is also known as Concora). "The mission then, as now," he says, "is to perpetuate, and perform with excellence, choral music of the highest quality for the broadest possible audience."
Tonight's 7:30 program in New Britain proclaims the anniversary in grand style.
Not only does it list Schubert's Mass in G, one of the works performed at the choir's 1974 debut, but it sets up a festive reunion, with former singers in the group coming from all over the country to swell Concora's ranks for the post-intermission group of pieces by Barber, Poulenc and other composers.
Larry Allen, the organist at the choir's inaugural concert 20 years ago, will be at the console again this evening, the music followed by a reception.
For details of future Concora events, call 224-5700.

The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
Malcolm W. Browne cites me as saying that American I.Q.'s have fallen about five points since 1900.
If I said that, I was wrong.
Average American I.Q.'s have, if anything, remained stable, if not grown, over that period.
He goes on to cite the decline in S.A.T. scores between 1962 and 1990.
But such a change cannot be hereditary.
Hereditary changes occur across generations; the period 1962-90 is within a single generation.

At Play in Old Miami Beach
(The budgets for the $500 weekends covered accommodations, sightseeing, food and drink, but not the cost of transportation to and from the cities.)
THERE is nothing subtle about the charms of Old Miami Beach, and nothing particularly authentic.
Imported palm trees and trucked-in sand line the shore just opposite the blocks and blocks of pastel Art Deco hotels and outdoor cafes that are packed, in the middle of the afternoon, with people drinking liquor and smoking up a storm, listening to piped-in Edith Piaf and Nat (King) Cole.


G.O.P. Strength Denies Cuomo A Close Finish; Suburbs Give Pataki Bounce
VOTERS in the New York City suburbs played a pivotal role in George E. Pataki's victory last week, sending him to the Executive Mansion with a margin of victory that far exceeded his statewide performance.
Interviews with 379 voters leaving polling places on Long Island and in the seven counties immediately north of New York City indicated that 60 percent voted for Mr.
Pataki, compared to 38 percent for Mario M. Cuomo, whose 12 years in Albany came to an abrupt end.

REMOVED from this city's trendy boutiques and sidewalk cafes is a warehouse, a former factory where once Tootsie Rolls trundled off an assembly line.
Today the only clue of what might lie behind the building's massive roll-up door is some scattered confetti on the ground.
But come Thanksgiving morning, just after midnight, the building's contents will be revealed when the large pulleys crank open the door of the 45-foot-high workroom and out will roll a convoy of floats and folded balloons headed to New York City.
By 9 A.M., that day it is expected some two million people will line up to be bedazzled as the re-assembled convoy winds its way through the canyons of the city, while another 35 million will watch on television.


It's 5, 4, 3, 2, Graham: Bring On the Cardinals!
Every Thursday until last week, Giants quarterback Dave Brown would meet the press.
As a cast of seemingly hundreds crammed themselves in front of Brown's locker, Kent Graham sometimes could not help staring.
Watching the spectacle from his nearby locker, Graham never felt envious or jealous; in fact, he would sometimes laugh and say that he was glad Brown was the one having to deal with the news media and not him.


An Epidemic Of Youth In Middle Age
LIKE a pugilistic Norma Desmond, George Foreman eased on a pair of old velvet trunks last week and headed for the prize ring, a bald and flabby trouper of a certain age out to avenge the darkest night of his youth.
In some fleeting way, Mr.
Foreman also set out to strike a blow for the relaxed-jeans generation, the baby boomers who are now hoping that with modern medicine and some latter-day Ponce de Leon in their corner, they will stay forever vital and young, defying gravity and the years.
With his knockout victory in the 10th round over a stunned opponent a generation younger, Mr.
Foreman became the latest god in the pantheon of the middle-aged -- celebrated and ordinary -- who are defying conventional boundaries of age.


Beware the Kudzu Gang and All Its Kind
This is about outlaws.
Not the gun-toting kind, but the kind with roots, leaves and stems.
Invasive species, the professionals call them, and a rich field of study they offer.
By definition they are the sorts of plants that usurp the territory of others, rampaging out of control.
To many gardeners and landscapers, they seem attractive and worthwhile at first, and are introduced to an area on purpose.
But then reality takes over.
Those who live in Florida know this kind of story well.
The melaleuca tree was introduced from Australia because the tree was known to have considerable water-absorption capabilities.
It sounded like the perfect solution to drain some of what were considered nasty wetlands, and melaleuca trees were planted freely.
Floridians never knew what they were getting into.


Unhand Me, You Cad!
AT THIS POINT, there is only one good thing to say about Capt.
James Hewitt, the cavalry officer who wooed Princess Diana and blabbed to the world.
With one audacious stroke, he has brought back the cad.
When Hewitt sold his story to The Daily Express in March, then compounded his offense by telling all to the author of "Princess in Love," newspaper columnists and editorial writers had to reach back a generation for the right word to characterize him.
He was a cad.
There was no other way to put it, although one magazine, in a 90's update, called him "supercad." Overnight, a seemingly vanished male type sprang back into life, if only for a brief, nostalgic moment.


Blame Stressful Student Life, Not Cornell Gorges, for Suicides
To the Editor:
Your Nov. 5 news article on the suicides at Cornell University never confirms or denies if the suicide rate at Cornell is higher than at other universities.
I suppose it is easier to invent some sort of mythological danger in the gorges on the Cornell campus, or in the weather, or the cows, than to analyze what drives a young person to take his or her own life.


Correction

Hey, Syracuse Did Make It to the 47 Once
For what it's worth, Boston College trounced Syracuse today with more conviction and more points than Miami did a week ago in the Carrier Dome.
Today's Eagle victory was 31-0 and last Saturday's Hurricane spanking of the Orange was 26-7.
The relevance has to do with the Big East standing, the final conference game, which will have Boston College at Miami on Nov. 26, and the bowl-game selections.


A Voice Raised for Freedom


Exotica in a Chinese Banquet
LONG ISLAND has many fine restaurants, but few unusual ones.
A good meal is not difficult to find but a very different one is.
Interesting dining experiences are rare, and exotic ones are even rarer.
But they do exist.
A goodly number of diners of Chinese background and a trickle of other adventurous eaters have found such a dinner at the Imperial Wok, on Marie Street in Hicksville (933-8688).
It is called a Fong-Wei or local specialty banquet.
This multicourse meal features the dishes of Yunnan province in southwestern China.


Wilma Rudolph, Star of the 1960 Olympics, Dies at 54
Wilma Rudolph, who grew from a sickly child unable to walk into a statuesque athlete of 20 who won three gold medals as a sprinter in the 1960 Olympics in Rome, died yesterday at her home in Brentwood, Tenn., near Nashville.
She was 54.
Her sister, Charlene Rudolph, said Rudolph learned in July that she had a malignant brain tumor.


Palm Bech On Wry
I shudder to think what it says about my character, but when I'm on vacation there are two things I like to do, almost to the exclusion of all others.
Number one, I like to drive around fancy neighborhoods, and number two, I like to browse through expensive stores.
And this is why I like Palm Beach so much.
These are not only the best things to do in Palm Beach; they are virtually the only things to do in Palm Beach.
Most normal, sensible, well-educated people wouldn't dream of going to Palm Beach for a vacation.
It's thought to be expensive, snobbish, boring, formal -- and it is.
But for the arrivistes, the social climbers, the would-be novelists, those among us who live in one room in the East Village but still thrill to each issue of Architectural Digest, it is perhaps the most exciting place on earth.
It's our Disney World.


A Tree Grows
Stay at a hotel and get a tree?
Well, sort of.
Through March 17, 1995, guests who book at the full rate at the Phoenix Park Hotel in Washington will have a tree planted in their name in the 1,752-acre Phoenix Park in Dublin.
The new trees, which include ash, oak, lime, beech, sycamore and horse chestnut, are part of an effort to restore the park, home to deer and some 60 bird species.
Dignitaries including George Bush and Pope John Paul II have already planted trees in the park.
Guests will receive a certificate signed by the Lord Mayor of Dublin showing the site of their plantings.
Rooms at the Phoenix Park Hotel, 520 North Capitol Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001. (202) 630-6900, start at $169.


SUNDAY, November 13. 1994; Homemade Skate Park
Portland, Ore., had two skateboard parks -- the one that the city built for $41,000 (which closed after two years for lack of insurance) and the good one that a bunch of skaters threw together under a bridge.
Portland's skateboarders built the second one illegally with damaged sacks of concrete on a vacant lot once frequented by drug dealers.
The result (below) is a splotchy maze of moguls and bowls near Burnside Street, a major thoroughfare.
Now four years old, Burnside has impressed the City Council.
"The Council admired the skaters' 'just do it' attitude," explains a spokeswoman.


NOV. 6-12: A Better Harvest; The Number of U.S. Farms Falls Below 2 Million
From Thomas Jefferson to Grant Wood, Americans have thought of their farmers as something special: stolid, valuable, virtuous.
Now they are so few.
Last week the Census Bureau announced that the number of American farms had dipped below 2 million for the first time since 1850, when Millard Fillmore was President.
The shrinkage has been a long-term trend caused mainly by more efficient production and the economic contretemps of the early to mid-1980's that forced many farmers into bankruptcy.
But if the 1,925,300 farms are much fewer than in past years, the farmers operating them are much better at it than they were a scant decade ago when declining land values, huge crop surplus and plunging commodity prices touched off the largest round of foreclosures since the Great Depression.
Lower interest rates, the salutary effects on exports of a declining dollar and an economic recovery in the third world, and bumper crops helped revive many farms .


How It Works: Guide-Dog School for People and Dogs
THE Seeing Eye and Guiding Eyes for the Blind, the most renowned guide-dog schools in the New York area, extensively interview prospective owners.
Guiding Eyes will send a representative to the home of anyone living too far to visit; the Seeing Eye often does, too.
During training, students live on campus, eating in the dining rooms and sleeping in the private or shared bedrooms.
A first-time guide-dog training at Seeing Eye takes 28 days; subsequent trainings take 21 days.
The training at Guiding Eyes lasts 26 days for first-time and veteran dog users.
At the Seeing Eye, the cost of the dog, training, room, board and transportation to Morristown, N.J., from anywhere in the United States is $150.
Training for subsequent dogs costs $50.
Guiding Eyes charges nothing for its dogs and trainings, though students pay for their own transportation.
If a student cannot afford the Seeing Eye's training or transportation to Guiding Eyes, the schools will cover the expenses.
Each school will send out trainers if problems arise.
Both are nonprofit agencies with endowments; the Seeing Eye's is $110 million, Guiding Eyes' $8 million.
Guiding Eyes also provides dogs for and trains blind people who have additional handicaps.


The County's Lure: More for the Money
WHAT induces companies to move from New York City to Westchester?
Is it because of the city's problems?
Tax reasons?
Or is it simply because a company's chief executive lives in Westchester?
Perhaps it is a quality-of-life decision.
Those may be contributing factors, said William V. Cuddy Jr., senior vice president and principal of Rostenberg-Doern Company, a commercial brokerage in Purchase.
But the bottom line, Mr.
Cuddy said, is that space in Westchester is a better buy.


Since 1854, Tea Treasures
PICTURE a discreet wood-paneled facade in the Marais, the most interesting and spiciest part of old Paris.
Should you open the front door and enter Mariage Freres, you can count on warming yourself all the way to your heart.
This is no ordinary tearoom; the Mariage family, which has been trading in tea since 1660, maintains a house of tea that is a treasure chest, even in this city of plenty.
In its front room and store, opened in 1854, shelves are stacked with glowing dark tins and boxes filled with 450 kinds of tea.
The rich mixture of scents has an edge of bergamot.
You pass all manner of tea services from East and West, bolstered with hampers, infusers and strainers.
Then the back room beckons, a creamy yellow space, filled with rattan chairs and vases of exotic greens, where waiters mill around in floppy white linen suits, regardless of the season.
The mood is as discreet as tea itself.
By midafternoon, the chatter of Parisian shoppers, trysting couples and Japanese tourists creates a hum under the soft classical music.

Ducks Are Unknowns Now in the Know
Roses are sold out on campus, alumni beg for field passes and Penn State may soon want to investigate.
The Oregon Ducks are the hottest team nobody knows, a late-game score the East Coast can live without.
But one more victory and they may be in a national championship game.
If Oregon masters Oregon State next Saturday on the road, the Ducks (8-3) are the Pacific-10 representative in the Rose Bowl and conceivably the final median strip between Penn State and an unbeaten season.
Their secret, however, is no longer safe, especially after today's obliteration of Stanford, 55-21.


Republicans Plan to Guide Foreign Policy by Purse String
In foreign policy, a domain traditionally run by the executive branch, Republican leaders in Congress say they plan to use the power of the purse to rein in President Clinton on several fronts, like cutting foreign aid or restricting funds for peacekeeping.
Setting the tone, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who is in line to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, outlined an approach distinctly different from Mr.
Clinton's, one displaying far more skepticism toward foreign aid and the United Nations.


Atlantic Center Loses Bradlees, Officials Say
Bradlees, the discount chain store that was meant to be the cornerstone of the 24-acre Atlantic Center development project in Fort Greene, will no longer be involved, said a Brooklyn business association official and others close to the project.
The development, which is scheduled to open late next year next to the Long Island Rail Road terminal at Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues, will provide housing for about 400 families and serve as a major retail center, with 160,000 square feet of store space and a large parking area.

The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
Malcolm W. Browne's excellent review of three new books on race and intelligence shows a healthy respect for empirical reality.
It is a fact of nature that people are not created equal in the eyes of I.Q. tests.
Concomitantly, and most fortunately, it is a fact of human nature that we can make all people equal in the eyes of the law.
Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Sam Adams were not confused on that point, and this is no time to encourage obfuscation.

Killer From Oklahoma Applauds Cuomo's Defeat, and Waits
Thomas Grasso, the double murderer whose wish to be executed in Oklahoma was blocked by Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo's insistence that he first serve 20 years to life in New York, has applauded Governor-elect George E. Pataki's victory and said he is looking forward to the death penalty in his home state.
"I just want to go back to Oklahoma to complete my execution sentence," Mr.
Grasso, 32, said in an interview published yesterday by The New York Post.
He has been confined at the state prison at Attica since his return from Oklahoma last October.
"I don't want to spend the rest of my life incarcerated."


SUNDAY, November 13. 1994; England's Puzzling Passion
The English love mazes.
Especially the present Marquess of Bath.
Twenty years ago, when he was a mere viscount, he commissioned Greg Bright to design the world's largest hedge maze (above) for his home, Longleat House.
He is now creating the Labyrinth of Longleat, composed of mazes by the world's leading designers.
One, the 18-inch-high Love Maze by Graham Burgess, has been planted and should be ready to walk through in a few years when the roses and boxwood mature.
Two others, a linked Sun Maze and Lunar Labyrinth, have been designed by Randoll Coate, who specializes in symbolic mazes.
Ground-breaking is tentatively set for next year.
The Marquess has not completely cornered the maze market.
Coate worked on a maze for the city of Bath and has recently been approached about a project on a smaller scale.
A collector of historic doll houses has asked him to do a circular maze for a miniature Palladian villa.
The maze will have a diameter of about five inches.


Selling Without A Broker
FOR sale by owner is an age-old concept that tantalizes almost all sellers once they've figured out that it will typically cost $12,000 to hire a broker for a $200,000 home.
In good times it can seem ridiculous amount to pay when homes are being snapped up faster than tickets to a rock concert.


Mark M. Pepper and Nicole D. Slater
Nicole Diane Slater, the daughter of Sandra Bernstein of Franklin Lakes, N.J., and Miles A. Slater of Pound Ridge, N.Y., was married last evening to Mark Matthew Pepper, the son of Maggie Weiss of San Francisco and Sanford Pepper of Salt Lake City.
Rabbi Steven Glazer officiated at the Harmonie Club in New York.
Mrs.
Pepper, 26, is a visual display artist in Salt Lake City.
She graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology and from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising.
Her father, a former president of Salomon Brothers International in London, is the president of the Ballast Group, investment bankers in New York.


Wengen Winter
AN Ogre, a Monk and a Virgin -- however unlikely a trio, the three great ascending peaks of central Switzerland stand guard over the snow fields of Wengen and Grindelwald, the chief ski stations of the Bernese Oberland high above the sedate resort of Interlaken.
Wengen, which has only about 1,050 permanent residents, is much the smaller and prettier of the two villages, made all the more pleasant by the absence of cars.
It was there I chose to go for a busman's holiday in the first week of March: after six weeks of working in a children's ski camp, I wanted to ski for myself.
It was here, under the Eiger, the Monch and the Jungfrau, that British gentlemen sportsmen popularized skiing as recreation after World War I. At Wengen, a rack railway built for summer tourists was used for the first time in the winter of 1910 to take skiers up the mountain; previously they had had to walk, or climb.
Hence the origins of the Downhill Only Club -- "unlike other places, we had the railway to bring us back up," explains a longtime member -- founded in 1925 and still a British institution in Wengen, where it shares a clubhouse with the equally British Wengen Curling Club. (The British influence remains strong in Wengen, even though Brits make up only a quarter of the visitors these days.)

Business Diary: November 6-11
COMPANIES Sears Goes Home (Having Just Sold the Family House)  In the public eye, Sears, Roebuck sells stuff -- tools, lingerie, you name it; it isn't the place to go for financial services.
And investors didn't know what to make of it.
Invest in the stores, you got Allstate; invest in Allstate, you got washing machines.
Last week Sears simplified matters in an instant, splitting off control of Allstate to shareholders -- thus waking from a grand conglomerate dream of the 80's.
"Sears is home now," one shareholder said.
Well, not exactly.
Earlier last week, washing its hands of a mountain of debt, Sears turned over the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago to a creditors' trust.
Also (yes, it was a busy week for Sears), Edward Brennan said he planned to retire as chairman when Allstate's gone, probably by mid-1995.
His chosen successor: Arthur Martinez, who in two years did wonders in rescuing Sears stores from terminal stodginess.


UNNATURAL SELECTION
Among the many issues raised by the practice of cloning is the question of who or what will be cloned.
To whom will the gatekeepers of life-after-life grant the privilege of immortality?
Geneti-Pet, a company in Port Townsend, Wash., is not a cloning service.
For $75 plus a $100-a-year storage fee, it will, however, store a vial of your pet's blood in liquid nitrogen so that when replication becomes widely available -- the assumption here is that this will happen during the course of a pet owner's lifetime -- you will have the means to wrest from your adorable little Puffles an eerie Puffles 2.
The process is fairly simple.
You send the company $175, whereupon it mails you a vial.
You take the vial and your pet to your veterinarian to extract one milliliter or so of blood.
You Fed Ex the sample back to Geneti-Pet, which slowly immerses it in the "cryogenic storage unit." Then you wait.
Every three months thereafter, Geneti-Pet sends you a newsletter about advances in the field of cloning.
Although the company is unsure if the replicated pet will retain memory of its former life, it contends that the new pet will be an infant.


BRONX UPDATE
*
WESTCHESTER SQUARE Since June 1993, the $7.8 million reconstruction of Westchester Square has created traffic jams and general havoc in one of the Bronx's busiest shopping and transportation centers.
But workers recently repaved the area's streets, the last of the major work, and are now turning to the final touches -- installing new street and parking signs.
The reconstruction included adding new curbs and wooden benches.
Most of the area's water mains were replaced, and new catch basins and sewers were built. *
CO-OP CITY The Department of City Planning has agreed to turn the Givan Creek Woods, a 10-acre natural area north of Co-op City, into park land.
The Department of Parks and many local residents had long pressed for the area's protection, but a section along Co-op City Boulevard may still be considered for commercial development.
"Maybe they can leave that alone," said Iris Baez, president of Co-op City's board of directors.
"They develop you to death. I'm sick and tired of seeing concrete." The area is home to many flowers, plants, squirrels, birds and rabbits, she said.


Chill Out! The New Hot Sport Is on Ice and Kerrigan Is the Biggest Star
Ice Wars ended tonight. In truth, the ice wars are just beginning.
For television networks and viewers hungry for action in this empty era of no baseball and no hockey, figure skating has become the new hot sport.
It attracts television viewers, even nonsports fans, even in prime time.
It puts paying customers in arenas.
It can supply an endless pool of talent.


Back to Basics in Lyons
WHEN I want authenticity, I go straight to the source.
So if I find my thoughts turning to steaming platters of chicken with red-wine vinegar, mountainous green salads tossed with croutons, eggs and cubes of fresh bacon, and sturdy bottles of fresh Beaujolais, a pilgrimage to Lyons is in order.
Ever since the turn of the century, when many of Lyons's cooks traded the kitchens of bourgeois families for their own closet-sized bistros, Lyonnais cooking has been synonymous with cuisine de bonne femme, meaning a style of home cooking -- by men or women -- that is at once generous, robust, economical and based on the region's wealth of plump poultry, fresh garden vegetables, tangy cheeses and fruity young wines.


Europe in Winter With a Package
APRIL in Paris is wonderful, but January in Paris is not bad either, if you've got a warm pair of gloves and shoes.
And the price is lots better than in the high season.
Here is information on a few of the many European winter packages offered by airlines and tour operators this year.
Almost all have a period around the holidays when the low prices do not apply.
The prices noted do not include United States departure tax or Customs and Immigration fees, foreign departure taxes or any airport facility charges.
Unless noted otherwise, the prices are for each of two people in a room.
All are available from travel agents; 800 numbers are given for ordering brochures or for further information.


In Search of the Man Within the Monster
ONE VAMPIRE TO ANOTHER, Antonio Banderas looks into Brad Pitt's icy-blue eyes and sizes him up: "A vampire with a human soul."
That's not necessarily a compliment in the land of the undead, but it's accurate and goes a long way toward explaining why Neil Jordan's new movie, "Interview With the Vampire," is one of the most horrific, emotional and best films of the year.
Though Tom Cruise gets star billing, this is the haunting tale of Louis (Mr. Pitt), a reluctant vampire who struggles across two centuries to retain some shred of human emotion.
Changing from man to vampire, he learns to sip blood and live in the dark. ("Coffins, unfortunately, are a necessity," he tells the interviewer recording his life story.) But through it all he continues to feel love, guilt, grief; he is a vampire we can identify with.

He was referring to the meeting of government leaders on Tuesday near Jakarta, where the final decisions will be made on whether to establish a deadline.

Team-First Concept Makes Packer Defense Even More Starry

"Every play is an emergency. As soon as the ball snaps, it's a critical matter that you get there."

And the assumptions may not be unfounded, the Luna Stage Company having produced its first full-scale production last year, "In the Name of the Woman," a theater piece in which four actresses span the centuries playing goddesses and witches and covering a panorama of women's issues, not excluding date rape.
The piece is to be revived in March.

Chalk Body Outlines: Grisly, Yes, but Chic
WHEN Michael Carr felt compelled several years ago to produce art that would commemorate the escalating number of violent deaths in Washington, one image haunted him.
So he went into an alley near his home in Washington's Northwest quadrant and began painting outlines of bodies in the style he had seen used at the scenes of homicides depicted in movies and on television.
By the end of 1992 he had painted 452 body outlines in acrylic house paint on Naylor Court, provoking the attention of newspaper and television reporters and the chagrin of some neighbors.
"It is a powerful subconscious image," Mr.
Carr said.

The New History: Showing Children the Dark Side
NOT so long ago, the Americans who made the history I read all appeared to be old men, dressed in dull clothing and devoted to principles so high I could perceive them only dimly.
They seemed to have lived far away in that adult world where you were not to say anything at all if it was not to be something nice.
By the time I began teaching in the 1980's, American history had been invigorated by the belated inclusion of a wide variety of groups traditionally excluded from the enterprise.
Their presence has altered the discipline forever.
As long as women and blacks, American Indians, Asian-Americans and others were not part of history, then what white men did to them was not part of the great narrative of the nation.
Now that all of our pasts figure in our history, however, tragedy is never too distant and celebration must share its place with reconciliation in the stories we teach.


The 'Third World' Is Dead, but Spirits Linger
NOT more than 60 miles down the highway from the Indonesian hill town of Bogor, where President Clinton will take part this week in an economic summit of Asian-Pacific nations, is a genteel city that once symbolized everything the third world believed in and hoped for when it was young.
The city is Bandung.
There, another generation of world leaders -- Nehru, Nasser, Nkrumah, Sukarno, Zhou Enlai -- met at another summit, the 1955 Afro-Asian Conference, a gathering full of post-colonial promise, with dreams of self-sufficiency, solidarity among newly independent nations and commitment to an anti-superpower international policy that became known as nonalignment.
"Sisters and brothers!" President Sukarno of Indonesia told the delegates.
"How terrifically dynamic is our time!"
The fraternal third world these founders envisioned is dead.
The agenda for Bogor, where the heirs of the Bandung generation plan to talk mostly about economic liberalization, competition for foreign investment and free trade, is its obituary.

Excellence Wasted?
To the Editor:
In the movie "Pulp Fiction" the direction was excellent, the acting likewise, but the content places all that excellence in abeyance  [ "When Fate Is Calling the Tune," Oct. 16 ] .


EDITORS NOTE
EDITORS' NOTE: An article on Aug. 14 about young gang members included photographs of Tamika Young and her friend Cee-lo Perez with recently acquired tattoos.
The Times has now learned that the tattoos were paid for by the photographer, a freelancer.
The subjects were about to get the tattoos on their own, but the gift created an unintended appearance of staged news photography, which would have violated The Times's policy.

Aristide Under Pressure to Set an Election Date
Three years of military dictatorship left Haiti with no electoral commission, no reliable voter registration rolls, even a shortage of paper to print ballots.
Nevertheless, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide faces mounting pressure from Haitian law, his American patrons and his supporters to set an early date for elections to fill more than 2,000 national and local posts.

Penn (20 Straight) Ties a Record and Wins the Ivy Title
Penn 33, Harvard 0
Terrance Stokes rushed for 143 yards and a touchdown and caught 5 passes for 37 more yards as Penn clinched its second consecutive Ivy League title with a 33-0 home victory over Harvard yesterday.


California Regulates Those Who Sell Travel
IN an effort to protect the California consumer, Gov.
Pete Wilson has signed legislation designed to offer a safeguard against potential travel-related scams and bankruptcies.
The law, which revises existing legislation, is widely expected to be used as a national model.
Travel scams cost consumers $12 billion a year, according to Federal Government estimates.

Dozing on the Shoulders Can Be Deadly
Just before 1 A.M. on a recent morning, 14 big trailer trucks were parked -- all illegally -- on the shoulders of Interstate 78 here.
Eight were pointed westbound, toward Pennsylvania, and six eastbound, toward Newark and New York City, and all 14 were potentially lethal hazards for cars and other trucks whizzing by.
So far this year, six people have been killed when vehicles have rammed into the backs of four rigs parked on the shoulders of either I-78 or I-287.
That pushes a pattern of desolate late-night crashes into a fourth year; from 1991 to 1993, there were 15 similar rear-end crashes on New Jersey's Interstates, and 17 people died in them, state records show.
In every case but one it was not the trucker, but the driver or passengers in the other vehicle who were killed.


On Sunday; An Actress Who Belongs To the Risk
"WHY does the actor not look out of the window first thing in the morning?" asks Rosaleen Linehan, setting up an old joke told by actors about their frequent states of unemployment.
"Because he'd have nothing to do for the rest of the day," she responds, her laughter bell-like across the idleness that's pretty much in the past for her now that she's a world-class actress.
Well, she is, even if she'd be the last to say so after working 35 years at acting, always wondering whether she'd get each job, then whether she was up to each role, and often being surprised along with the watching audiences at her own inventions.
Acting is the life for her, and New York, "so buzzy and so beautiful," she says, is the place to try it once more.

She is a graduate of Smith College.
The bride is the daughter of Mrs.
Norman Yellin of West Hartford, Conn., and the late Judge Yellin.
The bride's previous marriage ended in divorce.


Climate Change Played a Role in India's Plague; Action by New Delhi
To the Editor:
" 'Emperors of Garbage' " (Op-Ed, Nov. 5) suggests that exotic or disastrous events provide convenient case material to pronounce on what's good or bad for India.
But why should a few claim only they see, smell or care about the problem?
To proceed so would miss the efforts of those working to improve the human condition in India.


The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
Malcolm W. Browne is correct in noting that "it is sometimes difficult to tell good statistics from bad ones." But as executive director of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, I believe a review of the sources on which arguments are based can help sort out truth from ideologically motivated exaggerations.


DUMBING DOWN
We may build a better society when we stop separating out the gifted.
Why shouldn't the smartest children stimulate high-level discussion in a classroom?
Why shouldn't the brightest kids see slower friends strive to master a concept and be moved by the progress they make?
Perhaps children will learn that knowledge is meaningful only in a compassionate world.

CONNECTICUT GUIDE
HOLLAR'S ETCHINGS
The first great etchings produced in England were made by a Bohemian from Prague named Wenceslaus Hollar (1607-1677), who had been brought to London by the Earl of Arundel in 1636.
A comprehensive exhibition of his work, the first such display in America, opens at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven on Wednesday, remaining through Jan. 22.
A free symposium is scheduled on Saturday with English and American scholars and experts appearing at the museum, 1080 Chapel Street, from 10:30 to 4:30.


The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
Malcolm W. Browne summarized the three books about intelligence he reviewed on Oct. 16 as arguing that "America is rapidly evolving . . . an intellectually deprived population of men and women whose cognitive abilities will never match the future needs of most employers." I propose just the reverse summary: that this population is "being evolved" because the economy no longer needs it and, to continue Mr.
Browne's summary, that it will therefore be "permanently doomed . . . to welfare dependency, poverty, crime and lives shorn of any hope of realizing the American dream." To help drive this population farther out of the economy, the 1980's conservatives described it as a morally un deserving underclass that did not desire help, and this decade's conservatives now declare it genetically incapable of benefiting from any help, including education.


Wooed and Won, Clinton Finds Open Arms in Manila
Fidel V. Ramos wooed Bill Clinton and won him over.
The Philippine President was not pleased last fall when Mr.

He would be out campaigning, Mr.
Clinton said.


Meacham Paid Dues On Way to New Job
Bobby Meacham saw Ken Griffey Sr. several times this past season, and he wasn't sure if that was a good thing or not.
"Every time I saw him," Meacham related, laughing at the scene in his mind, "Griff said, 'Meach, I'm sorry, I should've caught the ball.' Then he would tell the guys, 'He threw me a ball that was running away, a little sinker. The next thing I know Meach is walking by me with his bags packed, going to Double A.' He would tell that story over and over, and he was always apologizing."


Ways to Look at the Past (Or Did It Really Happen?)
THE charges were as familiar as the names.
Last month the National Center for History in the Schools, an affiliation of teachers and administrators, released a volume entitled "National Standards for United States History: Exploring the American Experience," the first of two guidebooks on the teaching of history in grades 5 through 12; the second volume, "World History: Exploring Paths to the Present," was issued last week.
Sponsored by the University of California at Los Angeles, financed by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Department of Education, advised by distinguished professors across the land, the guides have managed to provoke instant controversy.


Weighing The Results Of the Election
EARLIER this year, Sue W. Kelly of Katonah, a lifelong Republican Party worker, reflected on her 35 years of service to the party and made a major decision.

"Why not me?"
Last week, showing strength throughout a northern Westchester Congressional District that had been represented for two generations by Congressmen named Hamilton Fish, Ms.
Kelly won election to the United States House of Representatives.

Technology; Fiat Hopes to Put a Tilt Into Amtrak's Trains
ADVANCED railroad technology pioneered in Europe by the Italian auto maker Fiat may soon make it much faster and more comfortable for travelers in the northeastern United States to get from one big city to another.
Fiat, based here, intends to bid on a $600 million contract to provide tilting trains to Amtrak in the United States.
It developed the system for such trains in the late 1960's and has delivered roughly 70 percent of those now operating worldwide.


Ramon Ramos, No Longer as the Rookie or the Shattered, Angry Man
For more than two months after Ramon Ramos Jr. was critically injured in an auto accident in 1989, the former star center of the Seton Hall basketball team lay in a coma.
For nearly three years after that, Ramos, who suffered extensive brain damage, was trapped in another prison, one born of anger and frustration.
Now, nearly five years later, a different Ramos quietly and contentedly lives his life in Puerto Rico, where he and his love for basketball were born.
The player who dreamed of being a star in the National Basketball Association for the Portland Trail Blazers, has long since countered the fury with hard work and a desire to remake his life.


All-Women's Colleges Back in Vogue
AT a time when educators and psychologists are saying that girls learn better in single-sex classrooms and develop more confidence and self-esteem to carry them into adulthood, two of the county's colleges that have remained women's schools are poised to take advantage of the recent studies.
Both the College of New Rochelle, founded in 1904, and Marymount College in Tarrytown, founded in 1907, are finding that their traditions are again becoming fashionable.
They continue to differ from other former all-women's colleges like Manhattanville and Sarah Lawrence, which have adopted co-education.
Marymount does have a weekend college open to men and women and the College of New Rochelle's program for adults is co-ed, but the undergraduate focus at both colleges remains on women, about 700 at Marymount and about 500 at the College of New Rochelle.


Firefighters Battle Large Blaze in Abandoned Airplane Factory
Long Island firefighters were still working early this morning to control a blaze that started yesterday afternoon at an abandoned airplane factory in East Farmingdale, shooting flames so high into the air that the orange glow could be seen more than five miles away.
No injuries were reported from the fire, which started at about 4 P.M. in the northeast corner of the old Fairchild Republic aircraft factory, a 91-acre complex of cavernous hangars, loading docks and graffiti-covered office buildings east of Route 110.

'Relativity' Has Its World Premiere
"I DON'T even know why I'm here." That's Audrey's entrance line when she bursts into her brother Neil's tract house one snowy night.
Now there's a nervy way to start up a play.
And starting up, as in instigate or provoke, is just what the playwright Mark Stein is doing in "Relativity," which is having its world premiere at the George Street Playhouse.


Begging for Crumbs
Be honest.
Isn't stuffing a bird its raison d'etre?
I've heard people say they wouldn't bother with the fat and mess of a goose, if it weren't for what a goose can hold.
I've heard the same thing said about ducks, pheasants and capons.
I've also wondered if modern poultry techniques would have survived given the sacrifices in flavor, if not for the larger, sturdier cavity that science has devised.
Considering the universal popularity of stuffing, and the prevailing tide of nutritional thought, you would think we would abandon the bird altogether and bake as much stuffing as we like, en casserole.
Yet the bird remains, harboring its precious cargo like an egg.
Not out of sentiment, especially, but out of utility, because a properly made stuffing is, at once, a perfume and a moisturizer that improves its host by the mere act of filling space.


'Blood-Curdling' Evidence
Two gunmen walked into a tiny Mexican luncheonette in Bedford Park a year and a half ago and robbed the cashier of $130.
They encountered no resistance, but they shot and killed three people and wounded a fourth.
Even the residents of this crime-weary borough were shocked by the pointless murders in the seven-seat Lena Restaurant.
The slain men -- a cook and dishwasher in the luncheonette and a nephew of the owner -- were all in their early 20's.


DUMBING DOWN
If Henig is opposed to the concept of heterogeneous grouping, I wonder what she would think of the newest New York City Board of Education concept of "bridge classes." A bridge is a class with two grades heterogeneously grouped!
In the fifth-and-sixth-grade bridge class I teach, I have 30 students whose reading scores range from the 90th to the 3d percentile, and whose abilities span at least five grade levels.
This situation exists in classrooms throughout the city.
Can you think of any student who would benefit from being in a class like mine, no matter how hard I try every day?

Wall Street; Election News Dims Power Company's Stock
FOR the Long Island Lighting Company, the Cuomo rally has turned into the Pataki crash.
Shares of Lilco fell 7 percent to $16.375 on Wednesday, as investors bailed out on news that Mario Cuomo had lost the election for Governor of New York.
By Friday, Lilco shares closed at $16.
It had only been several weeks before that Lilco shares rallied 6.8 percent on the day after Mr.
Cuomo proposed that New York State buy out the Hicksville, N.Y.-based utility for $2 billion, and assume its $7 billion in debt.
On Oct. 14, the day after Mr.
Cuomo's remarks, Lilco shares closed up $1.125 to $17.625.


Echoes of a Lurid Murder In Fight Over Co-Op Sale
It was a lurid tale of gambling, prostitution, infidelity and murder worthy of a Penny Dreadful, and it happened on the Upper East Side.
When Mark Fein, a wealthy executive who lived with his wife and three children at 1095 Park Avenue, was convicted of killing his bookie three decades ago, it earned headlines around the nation.
Now that episode has been recalled in a legal dispute between Mr.
Fein and his former wife over the recent $1.4 million sale of the nine-room Park Avenue apartment, which they bought in 1960 for about $60,000.

Britain Is Changing Its Dialing Codes
Britain will officially switch to new telephone codes starting next April 16, although the new ones are already in use with the old ones.
Under the new system, nearly all existing codes will be prefixed by 1.
For example, the code for inner London, (71) from overseas or (071) from within Britain, will become (171) or (0171) respectively; the code for Oxford, at present (865) from overseas, will become (1865) or (01865) from within Britain.


South Africa's Drakensberg
ON a slow Saturday in August my wife, Ann Cooper, and I drove south from Johannesburg, with a cassette of Brad Pitt reading Cormac McCarthy's elegiac cowboy novel "All the Pretty Horses," in the tape player and an easy, elusive feeling in our hearts.
It took a while to pin the feeling down: it was normalcy.
Among the unintended consequences of South Africa's miraculously tidy transition from white oligarchy to novice democracy is that it is now possible to enjoy a weekend, or a full-blown holiday, here without the oppressive sense that your pleasure is a violation, like a casino in a concentration camp.
South Africa is still an unresolved country, but it is no longer a constant morality play, and on this weekend we were bound for the Drakensberg Mountains (the name means Dragon Mountain in Afrikaans), free to enjoy a place of sublime beauty for its own sake.
The closest thing to a political implication in our trip was the small satisfaction of contributing a few dollars to Nelson Mandela's tourism industry.


The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
The academic fields of inquiry vary very widely, indeed, as to internal agreements on assumptions, methods and interpretations.
Disputes within, let us say, astrophysics and microbiology are hardly as pronounced as those within, for instance, economics and psychology.
In these last, cultural and social preferences do shape intellectual work to a very large degree.
That is a kind of seriousness -- but not the sort, clearly, Mr.
Browne was thinking of.
NORMAN BIRNBAUM  Washington


SUNDAY, November 13. 1994; Trysts in Doubt
When the University of Chicago survey of sexual practices came out, one conventional idea was confirmed: men have more sexual partners in a lifetime than women do.
Few news reports zeroed in on another aspect of the survey: the numbers didn't add up.
The survey calculated a median of six partners for men and two for women, an imbalance.
Furthermore, if you counted the actual partners reported, the two sides didn't match, as they should have if the survey was representative.
Since the men reported many more total partners than the women, some partners were clearly missing.


Corrections
An article yesterday about the Giuliani administration's proposal for a new contract with the Legal Aid Society misstated a court procedure.
Defendants who are not arraigned within 24 hours of their arrest are released to be arraigned later; their cases are not dismissed.


Changing Roles For a Landmark
To the Editor:
It's hardly a matter requiring a correction, but I was startled by the color photo run with your Posting on Oct. 23 headed "Changing Roles for a Landmark." It was a shot of the renovated Custom House, and it appeared mottled in a way suggesting perhaps brick-and-limestone construction -- which I knew was not the case.


The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
America shows no signs of ignoring "The Bell Curve" and the questions it raises.
The most ignoble reason is that its theories confirm what Americans already believe: that African-Americans are less intelligent than Americans of other races.
A 1990 study by the National Opinion Research Center found that the majority of whites still believe blacks to be inferior.
Among the answers: 53 percent of nonblack respondents said they thought blacks were less intelligent than whites, 51 percent agreed blacks were less patriotic, 62 percent thought blacks were lazier, and 78 percent said that blacks "prefer to live off welfare." To a lesser degree, Hispanic people and Southern whites were pegged with the same stereotypes.


Did Racial Redistricting Undermine Democrats
As politicians and academics analyze the forces that created this year's Republican tidal wave, another factor is taking its place alongside voter anger and President Clinton's unpopularity: the creation of majority black Congressional districts.
In 1982 Congress amended the Voting Rights Act to require that blacks and other minorities be given an enhanced opportunity to elect one of their own to Congress and to state legislatures.
To do that, Congressional and state legislative maps were redrawn after the 1990 Census, a process in which blacks and Republicans came together in an odd alliance to assure that minorities would constitute a majority in some districts.


Carnival Air's Success
To the Editor:
I was disappointed to read Alison Leigh Cowan's brief article "Shareholders Are Bumped" (Oct. 23).
The suggestion that Ted Arison, founder of Carnival Cruise Lines, took advantage of his position for his own personal gain is incorrect.


NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BRONX PARK EAST -- The Way They Were: Old Comrades (Re)unite; 'Coopniks' Toast Bronx Memories
Once upon a time, from the 1920's to 1940's, there flourished a proletarian utopia called the Allerton Coops in the East Bronx.
It was built by Eastern European Jewish immigrant trade-unionists, and only those who earned their livings by "the sweat of their brows" could live here.
Bosses -- blood-suckers, in Coopspeak -- were not welcome.


Meeting Cuts
That like rarely takes to like is the implied message of Nancy Caldwell Sorel and Edward Sorel's entertaining FIRST ENCOUNTERS: A Book of Memorable Meetings (Knopf, $24).
Chekhov and Tolstoy clearly didn't hit it off.
Neither, despite appearances, did de Gaulle and Roosevelt, or Hitler and Mussolini -- not to mention Churchill and Stalin, or J. Edgar Hoover and Emma Goldman.
These 63 "first encounters," which have appeared separately in The Atlantic Monthly over the past 12 years, prove how reliably fact can be stranger than fiction.
Isak Dinesen and Marilyn Monroe got along fine.
So did Houdini and Arthur Conan Doyle.
Less compatible were the more celebrated pairings of Chopin and George Sand, Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill, and Capt.
John Smith and Pocahontas.
But their stories, illustrated in color by Edward Sorel and retold spiritedly and concisely by Nancy Caldwell Sorel (they relate their own first meeting and subsequent marriage in an afterword), all benefit from a light touch.
What is the book's most memorable meeting?
Possibly the one between Fats Waller and Al Capone, who kidnapped the musician for a three-day party.
Equally appealing, though it relies entirely on Welles's authority, is the story of the encounter between William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles in an elevator in the Fairmont Hotel the day of the San Francisco premiere of "Citizen Kane." Welles introduced himself and invited Hearst to attend, but was met with stony silence.
As Hearst got off at his floor, Welles called after him: "Charles Foster Kane would have accepted." DAVID WALTON


Just in Case You Forgot the 60's Were Over


Seth P. Markowitz, Amy L. Grossman
Amy Lauren Grossman, a daughter of Joan and Kenneth S. Grossman of Great Neck, L.I., was married yesterday evening to Seth Paul Markowitz, the son of Barbara and Hal L. Markowitz of Woodbury, L.I.
Rabbi Ezra M. Finkelstein performed the ceremony at Temple Israel in Lawrence, L.I.
Mrs.
Markowitz, 24, is a graduate of Syracuse University and is studying for a master's degree in elementary education at New York University.
Her father is the chief executive and her mother is the product development manager of Brownstone Studio, a mail-order apparel company in New York.


Fresh Brewed Art Nouveau
A FEW minutes' walk from Warsaw's Old Town, and next door to the President's palace, the Cafe Bristol is a handy and inviting place to warm up after some fall or winter sightseeing.
Opened in 1901, the historic Hotel Bristol, which houses the cafe, was built by a construction company partly owned by the composer Ignace Jan Paderewski, and decorated in the Viennese Art Nouveau style by the Austrian designer Otto Wagner.
In 1981, after several decades of decline, the hotel closed; hotel and cafe officially reopened last year, renovated and refurbished in the original style.
In the cafe, a long wooden bar displaying French pastries and open sandwiches stands to one side, with tables looking out onto a handsome church, the Sisters of Wizytek.
The decor is a combination of turn-of-the-century Viennese and Art Deco, with mirrors, tiled floors, chandeliers, marble tables and palm trees.
The service is crisp and pleasant -- rare in Warsaw -- and the food can be as heavy as beef stroganoff or as light as tiramisu.
Soups, salads and croque- monsieur are also on the menu.


He Bought, He'll Sell, But Only to Buy Again
BILLY PEARSON, THE FORMER jockey, quiz-show celebrity and art dealer, is selling his collection of Americana.
At 74, he says he needs the money to buy more art.
In August, Mr.
Pearson shipped his weather vanes, trade signs, fire-engine memorabilia and other offbeat pieces to the gallery of David A. Schorsch, a private dealer on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
The 30 items on view in "The Billy Pearson Collection of Folk Art," through Dec. 15, represent most of what remains of the American folk art he began buying in 1939.


Working Order
For many people, blue jeans, ice cream and computers are life-sustaining products.
Those who want to see how they are made can consult a new book, "Watch It Made in the U.S.A.," by Bruce Brumberg and Karen Axelrod (John Muir Publications).
It describes tours of nearly 250 factories throughout the United States, from Robinson Iron in Alexander City, Alabama to Rocky Mountain Snacks in Pine Bluffs, Wyo.
Among those in between are the Levi Strauss blue jeans plants (San Francisco, California and Warsaw, Va.), Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream factory (Waterbury, Vt.) and the Intel computer chip company (Santa Clara, Calif.).
Available at bookstores for $16.95 or to order (800) 888-7504.


Sunshine Is Dizzying In Albania's New Dawn
THERE are gaping potholes on the major thoroughfares here streets named Bajram Curri, Bulevardi Shqiperia and Myslym Shyri.
In an annoying way, they represent a sign of progress: Two years ago there were none.
There were almost no heavy vehicles to cause them and hardly any automobiles at all.
Now Tirana's traffic jams fill the air with blasts of their horns from dawn to well after dark.
Still, horse carts, bicycles, thousands of pedestrians and the occasional cow compete for space on the roads, reminders of the all-too-recent past.


SUNDAY, November 13. 1994; The Time of Life
A prime candidate for most useless piece of electronic nonsense to be marketed in 1994 -- the Timisis Lifeclock.
The Zygon International catalogue copy reads: "Enter your name, gender and age. This microcomputer clock then counts down the actual hours, minutes and seconds remaining in your lifetime." Well, actually it counts the hours, minutes and seconds in the life of a statistically average person of your gender and age.
Of course, that's not all.
For a mere $99.95, it also looks like a personal organizer and provides you with 150 "motivational messages," if you have the time to read them.


Swedes Divided On Joining Europe
In a shopping mall in Haninge, a blue-collar suburb south of here, campaign volunteers worked the noonday crowd today, handing out pamphlets and bright blue buttons emblazoned with a single word: "Yes."
"The European train is leaving now, and Sweden has a ticket," read one of the flyers given to passersby.
"Don't throw it away."


New Greenburgh Law On Carbon Monoxide
AS part of a restructuring of an already rigorous building code, the town of Greenburgh recently adopted a provision to require that new buildings, both commercial and residential, install carbon-monoxide detectors.
This measure was prompted in part by the recent death of the tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis and, closer to home, the death last year of a Hartsdale resident .
"We are re-adopting a sprinkler law that has been around since 1982 because the state told us that the law was defective on technicalities," said Paul J. Feiner, Greenburgh Town Supervisor.
"As we were revising a tough sprinkler law, we thought we might as well add this."


Denise Forsythe, Henry J. Adler
Denise Ann Forsythe, the daughter of Anne and Dennis Forsythe of Scottdale, Pa., was married yesterday at St.
Pius X Church in Mount Pleasant, Pa., to Dr.
Henry J. Adler, a son of Caroline and Stephen Adler of Holliswood, Queens.
Rabbi Elliot Burk performed the ceremony, in which the Rev.
Henry Dinicco, a Roman Catholic priest, took part.
Mrs.
Adler, 30, graduated from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in Rochester.
Until recently she was a billing analyst for Argent &amp; Fox, a Washington law firm.
Her mother is an operating-room nurse at the Frick Hospital and Community Health Center in Mount Pleasant.
The bride's father is a house painter in Scottdale.


An Important First Step for New Products
To the Editor:
As the director of marketing research for L'Oreal when it introduced mousse in 1983, I was particularly interested in Harry Gaines's article "Teaching Scientists to Talk Business" (Viewpoints, Oct. 2).
One of the key reasons why our introduction was so successful was that the product was placed with consumers early in the process, before large-scale market research testing.
By utilizing this qualitative research technique, marketing and R.&amp; D. were able to learn about consumers' experiences with the product.
An insightful facilitator was able to then provide input for the product formulation, instructions for usage and product positioning-advertising.
If this small, but critical, first step had been overlooked, we might have risked consumer acceptance of mousse styling products in the United States.


Moss's Lawyer Speaks of Deal
Wisconsin tailback BRENT MOSS might plead guilty to misdemeanor drug possession if prosecutors agree to recommend a lenient sentence, his lawyer said yesterday.
Moss, 22, the most valuable player of the Badgers' Rose Bowl victory last season, was suspended from the team on Thursday after he and a companion were arrested.
The police said Moss had $50 worth of base cocaine when he was arrested during a traffic investigation.
The police said charges against Moss included possession with intent to deliver cocaine.
The maximum penalty is 10 years in prison.

MOMENTUM BUILDS FOR CUTTING BACK WELFARE SYSTEM
After a campaign in which voters rewarded a barrage of anti-welfare attacks, both parties are now calling the issue a top priority, and both are repeating stern promises to make recipients work.
As the smoke clears from the new political landscape, Democrats and Republicans each appear ready to cut benefits, increase work obligations and provide fewer protections for the 14.3 million people who rely on Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare program.
More than nine million of the recipients are children.


THE NATION: Right Stuff; G.O.P. Unleashes Its New Weapon: Winning Candidates
THE Republican romp in Tuesday's election was a repudiation of President Clinton.
It represented disgust with big government and the way Congress has been operating.
It indicated a shift toward conservatism.
It reflected the anxiety of many voters about their future and that of their children in a rapidly changing economy.
Or so the pundits say.
These may in fact be trends, or they may be fleeting fancies that will evaporate by the next election.
But one underpinning of the sweeping Republican victory that may represent a lasting change in American politics has hardly been noticed: Republicans this year fielded more appealing candidates than Democrats for offices from coast to coast, removing an edge Democrats have banked on for years.


Moving Ahead at Medical Center
IT was mostly good news last week for the beleaguered Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla.
After several delays and a series of interim contracts, a politically controversial 10-year affiliation agreement between the public hospital and New York Medical College got final approval from the County Board of Legislators.
Also, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke announced that the Medical Center would likely end the year in the black, despite earlier forecasts of a $7 million deficit.


THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: Cuomo, a Mystery in an Enigma in a Politician, and His Final Race; In an Interview, No Excuses, No Regrets, Some Uncertainty
He lost the election and the job he has held for 12 years.
But Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo has retained his equilibrium, his sense of humor and his penchant for self-examination, even when the mirror he holds up reflects rejection and regret.
So it seemed in a 90-minute conversation, the first extensive interview since his defeat, in which Mr.
Cuomo expressed few second thoughts about running for a fourth term and said he fell victim to swirling cross currents of voter discontent.
And yet, for a man who spent so much of his tenure blaming his failings on uncontrollable forces, Mr.
Cuomo did not transfer responsibility for his loss.


Clinton Begins Pacific Visit in Manila
President Clinton began a Pacific tour here this morning with somber stops to honor nearly a century of economic and security ties between the United States and the Philippines, its first colony.
With visits to Corregidor Island and an American military cemetery, Mr.
Clinton is seeking to honor American-Filipino suffering at the outset of World War II and the fighting that finally liberated the Philippines from Japanese control in the final months of the conflict.


Miss McMullan and Mr. Del Priore
K.
Mavourneen McMullan, a daughter of Rose Mary McMullan of Greenwich, Conn., and the late Robert J. McMullan, was married yesterday to Charles J. Del Priore Jr., the son of Valerie and Charles J. Del Priore of New Rochelle, N.Y.
Msgr.
Vincent W. Jeffers performed the ceremony at St.
Michael's Church in Greenwich.


The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
Malcolm W. Browne states that recent research in intelligence and its possible genetic link to race has been "neither fashionable nor safe for the last three decades." Whether or not study of this question has been seen as politically appropriate, in fact considerable research has been conducted during this period; very little of it, however, supports the conclusion that some races are cognitively less able than others.


Seminoles Win the Rematch That Wasn't
In a reverse of 1993's game of the year, the Seminoles used a running attack to defeat Notre Dame, 23-16, today before 72,868 at the Florida Citrus Bowl.
The game had been a sellout since 2,500 general-admission tickets were sold in six minutes in June.
At that time, both two teams still had visions of a national championship and the game would be a rematch of last year's No. 1 versus No. 2 matchup won by the Irish, 31-24.


A.T.M. Shock
To the Editor: Something new in automated teller machines: In Vienna I came upon an A.T.M. that exchanged one currency for another.
I inserted a United States $5 bill and the receipt showed that was worth 57 Austrian schillings -- not bad.
However the machine kept 23 schillings commission, leaving me 34.
I was glad I didn't exchange a larger bill.

Sports of The Times; The Heisman Vote's 3-Card Monte
I TUNED into WFAN during a recent drive from State College, Pa., and was intrigued by an intense debate over the issue of awarding the Heisman Trophy.
The host, Bill Daughtry, who can be counted on for a thought-provoking show, said that among college quarterbacks Steve McNair of Alcorn State was the front-runner for the Heisman Trophy.
Hands down.
You'd have thought he called for the dissolution of the union.


[ APPEARANCES ] ; The Resistance Movement
THE OTHER DAY THE COLLAGEN Corporation invited some writers and editors to a presentation by Debbie Then, a social psychologist from Stanford University who gave a talk on women's new attitudes toward "cosmetic procedures," meaning anything from chemical peels to collagen injections to surgery.
We saw a video of attractive (but not flashy) women talking openly and positively about how they'd had work done to please themselves, and how much happier and more confident they felt afterward.
These women didn't look old and they didn't look young; they had the smooth look of affluence.
According to Then's survey, women who elect to have cosmetic procedures are trend-setters.
Heroines of consumerism, they'd been the first to equip themselves with VCR's and cellular phones.
One member of the audience objected to the cost -- $400 for collagen injections that in some cases might have to be redone every four months.
She didn't mention surgery, which could easily run as high as $8,000, none of it covered by health insurance.
Nobody from the Collagen Corporation said anything about trying to bring down the price.
But then no one would ever consider bringing down the price of a Prada backpack, either.
Wasn't that part of the point, that the ageless face signaled membership in the consumer elite?


Whitman's Popularity Helped Lautenberg
THE "time for a change" wave that swept Republicans into office across the country last Tuesday fell flat when it reached the United States Senate race in New Jersey.
And paradoxically, the popularity of the Republican Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, may have been part of the reason.
While angry voters were rejecting Democrats running for Congress and statehouses in the metropolitan area and elsewhere, the Democratic Party in New Jersey was showing signs of stabilizing after last year's defeat of Gov.
Jim Florio by Mrs.
Whitman.


Steely Dan (Half of It, That Is) Strikes Back
FIFTEEN YEARS LATER, WE find out who put the edge into Steely Dan.
It was Walter Becker, who played bass and guitar and left the lead vocals to his songwriting partner, Donald Fagen.
On his first solo album, "11 Tracks of Whack," Becker brings back everything fans cherished about Steely Dan: the desperate characters and elliptical narratives, the jazz harmonies and the ingeniously warped structures.
And it turns out he has exactly the right voice for his own words: a groan that's jaded, long-suffering, cranky and shrewd.
The first words Becker sings are "In case you're wondering, it's alive and well."
Becker is as much an oddball now as Steely Dan was during its million-selling reign in the 1970's.
On seven remarkable albums from 1972 to 1979, Steely Dan perfected stealth pop: songs in which calm tempos and suave production cloaked unlikely musical twists and lyrics about topics like stock-market crashes, Puerto Rican immigration or the golden age of be-bop.
Only Paul Simon, Randy Newman and the best Brazilian songwriters showed the same musical sophistication, while Steely Dan had a terse cynicism all its own: a fascination with sleaze and duplicity that was one part hipster slumming, two parts film noir.


Columbia Savors Victory 23 Years in the Making
Sisyphus had nothing on these guys.
For more than two decades, the Columbia football team pushed its figurative boulder up the hill only to have it roll back over the Lions and all the way down over and over again.
But Columbia finally reached the summit yesterday afternoon at Wien Stadium.
The Lions scored their most points in a dozen years, and then held off a late Cornell rally for a wild 38-33 victory before 8,825.
The game featured 4 lead changes, 998 total yards, 7 Columbia pass plays that gained 20 or more yards, and 6 Cornell plays from scrimmage that accomplished the same thing.

The New Chelsea's Many Faces
TWILIGHT cloaked the raw-edged precinct west of the old High Line, the abandoned railroad viaduct that haunts lower 10th Avenue.
Ghostly signs, ever fading on the brick walls of brooding old lofts, attested to businesses long lost: "Spears Furniture Exchange" and "Kiln-Dried Lumber" and "Tower's Warehouses."
By all rights, West 22d Street should have been empty on the evening of Oct. 28.
Instead, there were so many cabs and black sedans that traffic could barely move.
The art crowd had descended in a pincers movement from uptown and downtown on the new Matthew Marks Gallery, which opened with a show by Ellsworth Kelly.


BENNINGTON MEANS BUSINESS

Palestinians Arrest 100 Islamic Militants After Bicycle Bombing
Raiding scores of houses and a mosque, the Palestinian police arrested more than 100 Islamic militants today in a crackdown ordered after a suicide bomber killed three Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint near this Jewish settlement.
But even as they spoke of a new, tougher policy against Muslim militants, leaders of the Palestinian self-rule authority said that the Israelis would not have died on Friday if the 19 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip did not exist.
In particular, they denounced Netzarim, an isolated community near the Mediterranean where platoons of Israeli soldiers stand guard over at most 28 families.


The Sounds Of Silence At Tap Center
Tap dancing evolved from Irish and African dances in the late 1800's and flourished in New York musicals and clubs in the 1920's.
And this uniquely American art form experienced a renaissance in the last two decades, with the comeback of old masters like Honi Coles and a new generation like the Hines Brothers, starring in Broadway shows like "Bubbling Brown Sugar," "Jelly's Last Jam," "Black and Blue" and "My One and Only."


In Green Bay, Jets' Toughest Foe Is One They Can't Tackle
The Jets brushed up on their Green Bay history this week -- the men from the biggest market in the N.F.L. learning something about the smallest.
It has been 15 years since the one and only time the Jets played at Lambeau Field, the real home of the Packers, and the Lombardi tradition.


John A. Volpe, Nixon Supporter And Massachusetts Governor, 85
John Anthony Volpe, a former Governor of Massachusetts, Ambassador to Italy and United States Secretary of Transportation, died on Friday night.
He was 85 and lived in Nahunt, Mass.
The Nahunt police attributed his death to natural causes.


Habitats/Renovating a Classic; Cutting a Few Corners to Keep Costs From Soaring
THE architects riffled through their 2-inch stack of glossy photographs searching for the right "before" shots to illustrate their points about renovating the 1,500-square-foot apartment for less than $75,000, including the architects' fee.
The photographs of the classic six-room prewar apartment at 9 East 96th Street, off Fifth Avenue, show the kind of place real estate ads describe as needing "TLC" or "in estate condition." It wasn't exactly a wreck -- plaster wasn't hanging off the walls -- but it needed work.


RICHARD FERBER
In the parents' support groups I lead, many parents are frustrated at the distance between themselves and their children as they grow older.
Comforting and listening to an infant or toddler at night is one of the first steps to opening the lines of communication that parents will want to last a lifetime.

Nets Miss The Point In Another Ugly Loss
No matter how often Coach Butch Beard berated and begged the Nets, no matter how many timeouts he called and no matter how many animated conversations the players had on the court and on the bench, nothing could make their shots fall tonight -- and nothing could prevent the Houston Rockets from trouncing them.
The Nets entered the game with the worst field-goal percentage in the league, and they validated that unenviable position by missing shot after horrid shot.
Derrick Coleman clanged iron on his first 11 attempts and did not hit a field goal until the third quarter was more than half over.
On several possessions in the fourth period, none of the five Nets on the floor seemed excited about the prospect of even attempting a shot.


Rhodes
To the Editor: I just finished reading "Rhodes Sojourn With Plenty of Company" by Susan Spano (Oct. 9), and I would like to add a few things.
Yes, Rhodes is expensive, compared with other parts of Greece, but it is still relatively inexpensive compared with other European destinations.


The Lost Years of a Nobel Laureate
SEVERAL weeks before the 1994 Nobel prize in economics was announced on Oct. 11, two mathematicians -- Harold W. Kuhn and John Forbes Nash Jr. -- visited their old teacher, Albert W. Tucker, now almost 90 and bedridden, at Meadow Lakes, a nursing home near here.
Mr.
Nash hadn't spoken with his mentor in several years.
Their hour-long conversation, from which Mr.
Kuhn excused himself, concerned number theory.
When Mr.
Nash stepped out of the room, Mr.
Kuhn returned to tell Mr.
Tucker a stunning secret: Unbeknownst to Mr.
Nash, the Royal Swedish Academy intended to grant Mr.
Nash a Nobel for work he had done as the old man's student in 1949, work that turned out to have revolutionary implications for economics.


The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
The Book Review could better serve its readers if, instead of repeating platitudes about J. Philippe Rushton's right to be heard, it were to exercise its responsibility to examine what Mr.
Rushton is saying.
Malcolm W. Browne quotes Rushton apologists to the effect that "as science, there is nothing wrong with Rushton's work in principle." Nothing could be farther from the truth, as even a cursory examination of Mr.
Rushton's publications reveals.
The bulk of his controversial claims are published in journals that do not adhere to the standard scientific procedures of review and criticism by scientific colleagues.

NOV. 6-12: Amid Rumors; Reagan Discloses His Alzheimer's
Alzheimer's disease causes the mental and physical deterioration of an estimated 4 million Americans.
And it tears at the hearts of millions more who must cope with watching a loved one unravel.
Last weekend, former President Ronald Reagan disclosed that he has entered the early stages of the incurable and ultimately fatal disease.
Letters of support from well-wishers poured into Mr.
Reagan's home in California.
But there was little comfort in reports that the 83-year-old Mr.
Reagan, whose talent as a storyteller was legendary, now forgets the punch lines to some of his favorite jokes.

Poussin Is Revered, but Can He Be Enjoyed?
FOR A MODERN VIEWER, especially one who isn't French, Nicolas Poussin may be the most difficult of all the great artists to appreciate.
Anyone dimly familiar with the history of painting can probably conjure up an image of his "Rape of the Sabines" or "The Massacre of the Innocents." But that image can seem very remote.
Poussin's world was that of the dramatist Pierre Corneille, not ours, and no less distant and abstract.
It is steeped in arcana and the classical past.
It is a world where passion usually takes a back seat to duty and honor.
Poussin was the ultimate painter-philosopher, contemplative and unostentatious in his life and his work.
A laborious and painstaking craftsman, he had none of the visceral swagger that we admire in the work of his 17th-century contemporaries, like Rubens, Bernini, Velazquez and Rembrandt.
All of them are more accessible to us.
We can revere Poussin.
But can we enjoy him?


Private Club For Everyone
FORGET the noisy, 90's cappuccino bars.
In Boston, on a cold night, the place to get warm is the Ritz Bar, where perfect martinis are poured at your table by waiters in tuxedos, as they have been since 1933.
The Ritz Bar, in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, is a wood-paneled oasis of tranquillity, and old Boston.
The armchairs are upholstered, the fireplace marble, the peanuts served in little silver bowls.
And the glasses are stamped with the Ritz lion logo.

'If I Were Younger I Would Make Myself Russian': Voltaire's Encounter With the Czars
"WHEN, toward the beginning of our century the czar Peter laid the foundations of Petersburg, or rather of his empire," Voltaire observed in the 18th century, "no one foresaw success." No one, he thought, could have imagined that arts and letters would flourish there, that the Russian empire, "almost unknown to us until then, would be civilized in 50 years," and anyone who predicted it would have been dismissed as a visionary.
Voltaire spoke for the 18th century's amazement at the phenomenon of Russia, its revolutions and transformations, unforeseeable and unimaginable to those who watched from far away.
Our own century has witnessed revolutions in Russia no less astonishing and unpredictable, right up to the most recent years; tremendous events have left every interested observer, even the visionaries, reeling from the pace at which history has outstripped our imaginations.
Petersburg has become St.
Petersburg again.

Liftoff
THEY CALL IT AN information highway, but that's like calling a live person a skeleton.
That overused road metaphor may help to explain the invisible technology of the Internet -- how electronic messages are driven from George's home computer along a network of local streets to a web of networks, the Interstate, and back onto local streets to Mary's computer in Moscow (Idaho, Russia or both).
It's an arterial system, but the experience of traveling the net is nothing like a ride in a car.
At one level, it's like having a highly efficient telephone and telegraph service, with both private and party lines.
At another, it's like flying an information spaceship and docking at other computers to copy lists and texts and pictures and computer programs.
And at yet another level, it can feel like an untethered walk in space to visit other travelers -- thrilling, disorienting, unreal.
It's not, yet, an easy trip.


NOV. 6-12: One Shoe Drops; The United States Stops Enforcing Embargo On Weapons to Bosnia
Usually the Pentagon makes news by launching a military operation.
But last week it sent shock waves through NATO by stopping one.
Breaking with its Western European allies, American military forces yesterday stopped enforcing the two-year-old United Nations ban on weapon shipments to the Bosnian Government.


3 Bangkok Hotels Turn To River to Beat Jams
Alarmed by traffic congestion that is among the world's worst, three of Bangkok's leading hotels have banded together to provide a river-taxi service to deliver guests from the international airport to their location along the Chao Phraya River.
The hotels -- the Oriental, the Shangri-La and the Royal Orchid Sheraton -- offer the boat service every day from 6 A.M. to 9 P.M. for a one-way fee of $28.
A regular taxi costs about $20.
Guests traveling on the river taxi, the River Express, are met at the airport and taken by bus to a nearby pier, where they board a jet-propelled catamaran capable of seating 40.
Travel time is about one hour, less than half the time it can take by car.
The boats leave every 30 minutes.


With Pataki, What You See Is Just What You Get
Almost everyone on his plane knew that George E. Pataki had worn the same red-orange tie for the last three days of his lurching but successful campaign for governor, and not for luck.
Of course, it had never occurred to him.
"No, no," he said, looking down at his neckwear with some embarrassment.
"I just have similar ties."


Close Quarters
To the Editor:
Regarding your article "The Cone Sisters: Shoppers or Connoisseurs"  [ Oct. 30 ] , the Cone sisters were my grandfather's first cousins.
In the late 1930's I had the opportunity to see Etta Cone's home, where every available inch of wall space was jampacked in what seemed to me a not particularly tasteful manner.


Profile; Utility Competition Is Coming! (He's Ready, of Course)
AS the 45-story stacks of the giant Gibson generating station loomed into view amid the cornfields and woods here in southwestern Indiana, James E. Rogers looked down from the helicopter and said, "Thank God I've got smart people running this."
Mr.
Rogers, at 47, is vice chairman and president of the Cinergy Corporation, a holding company for two Midwest utilities.
But he makes no pretense of being a technical expert, having spent most his career as a lawyer, at one time fighting the utility industry on behalf of consumers.

The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
The authors of the three books reviewed by Malcolm W. Browne are to be commended on one insight they apparently share: that the growing gap between the higher-I.Q. upper classes and the lower-I.Q.
"underclass" is deplorable.
Beyond that, their brain cells seem to be lacking the serotonin needed to make some important intellectual connections.
If I.Q.'s -- skewed as the tests may be -- can be increased even temporarily by Head Start, not to mention by good nutrition and housing, stable and caring homes, etc., surely there is more to nurture over nature than these scholars admit.

Best Illustrated Books of the Year
The illustrations on these pages have been taken from the Book Review's choices of the 10 best illustrated children's books of 1994.
The Book Review has annually asked a panel of three judges to make a selection from among the several thousand children's books published each year.
The Judges this year were Liz Rosenberg, who teaches creative writing at the State University of New York, Binghampton, and whose books include "Monster Mama"; Randall Enos, a children's service consultant to the Ramapo Catskill library system; and Jacqueline Chwast, an artist whose most recent children's book is "The Perilous Pit." As a matter of note, Jerry Pinkey was a winner once before, Paul O. Zelinsky twice before, Henrik Drescher three times before and Peter Sis four times before.


BENNINGTON MEANS BUSINESS
As the mother of a first-year student at Bennington, I, too, worry that the college is losing old friends.
But I balance this concern with an appreciation of what is new.
Not that I underestimate the importance of tenure and issues of fairness, but as a parent, I am not displeased that poetry is taught by the poetry editor of a famous literary magazine.
Nor, I confess, would I be horrified if, someday, that teacher had to move over for another -- my son, my daughter?
Does that sound callous?
Perhaps not to those of us who accept that job security depends on the ability to offer current, marketable skills.

Clashing Styles or Bad Manners?
To the Editor:
Barbara Presley Noble refers to some of Deborah Tannen's ideas as "nonsense on stilts" ("Sex Differences, or Something Else," At Work, Oct. 23), and I've had my suspicions about Dr.
Tannen's ideas for some time.
In an article written by Dr.
Tannen in The New York Times Magazine, she lamented the fact that women were readily classified by their clothing, while men's clothing gave them anonymity.
Excuse me?
I attend many business functions with my husband and believe me it's not hard to tell the players from the drones from the wannabes-without-a-clue.
Many men in academe do look interchangeable, but in the real world, you can tell the players without a scorecard, and their clothing is a major clue.

TRULY GROSS ECONOMIC PRODUCT
I suspect that Nicholas Wade (lucky man) has never been on a diet, since he reports that "affluence makes obesity possible." On the contrary, a healthy diet always costs more.
In most cases, the more sinful the food, the less it costs.

Many Factors In Area's Lead In Fire Deaths
Here, more than anywhere else in New York City, people die in fires.
Community Board 12, in southeastern Queens, is not the city leader in fires or arson.
But a variety of factors, from the area's high density to its wood-frame houses, have made the district No. 1 in fire fatalities.
Since 1989, the rate has been more than three times the national average; in the city, only in East Tremont, where 87 people perished in the Happy Land Social Club in 1990, has fire killed more people.


The Executive Computer; Can Apple and I.B.M. Go It Together?
APPLE COMPUTER and I.B.M. have defined the personal computer industry at least once each separately, perhaps twice in Apple's case.
Can they do it again together?
The answer is yes, but not without a lot of qualifiers.
So dominant is the design originated by I.B.M., which is based on a microprocessor from Intel and operating system software from Microsoft, that no new platform is likely to supplant it.
But if they move quickly, and with few missteps, Apple and I.B.M -- two of the three largest PC makers -- can create a viable alternative.
Last week, Apple, I.B.M. and Motorola announced that they would jointly develop a hardware blueprint for computers based on the PowerPC microprocessor they have jointly produced.
The new machine would be a computing chameleon, able to run operating systems like I.B.M.'s OS/2, Apple's Mac OS, and versions of Unix from I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems.
As does Apple's Power Macintosh, the new machine could run Microsoft Windows, but only under "emulation" -- a "let's pretend" software technique that has never been totally satisfying.
Critics were quick to cry "too little, too late," saying that the companies should have reached this agreement three years ago when they began work on the PowerPC chip.
And there was the loud sound of just one shoe falling: where was an agreement by Apple to license Mac OS to I.B.M.?
Trade publications have reported that Apple will disclose licensing plans tomorrow at the Comdex computer convention in Las Vegas, but the company has declined to comment.
The projected delivery date of the hardware design, sometime in 1996, also seemed too far away to matter, leaving Microsoft and Intel to carve up the market in the meantime.
"If this lands in mid-1996, who cares?" asked Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest.
"Why would anyone invest in this merged platform unless Apple licenses the operating system?"
But corporate buyers were more receptive to the proposed machine than were the pundits.
They like the idea of a single computer that could run all the multiple operating systems they live with today on multiple computers, which would reduce confusion and lower technical support costs.
Just knowing such a machine is coming makes buying a Power Macintosh a safer choice today, because there is a migration path.
Also, the oft-projected decline and fall of the Macintosh line of computers -- usually based on the argument that it has attained only a 10 percent share of the market -- would seem a false prophecy.
During the third quarter, for example, Apple's United States shipments of 640,000 Macintosh's made it the leading personal computer for that period, ahead of Compaq at 600,000 and I.B.M. at 500,000, according to the International Data Corporation, a market research organization based in Framingham, Mass.
Personal computers based on Intel or Intel-compatible microprocessors and Microsoft's Windows operating systems (the kind that used to be called I.B.M.-compatible) are going through a transition of their own -- from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95.
This is more than a simple software upgrade; it is a shift from a 16-bit operating system to one that processes data in 32-bit chunks.
That potentially rocky road to Wellville could create an opportunity for alternatives, like a new platform from I.B.M. and Apple.
"The market power of these two companies is greater than the sum of their market shares," said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research in Phoenix.
"Most people who have criticized this venture have focused on today. This is not about today," he continued.
"This is about the 32-bit environment, which will grow and come to dominate the market by the end of the decade."
For many years already, Apple's Macintosh has been a 32-bit machine running a 32-bit operating system.
I.B.M.'s recently introduced OS/2 Warp is a 32-bit operating system.
But Microsoft is still making the transition to a 32-bit operating system with Windows 95, which will not ship until some time next year.
Windows NT, Microsoft's more advanced operating system introduced last year, is a 32-bit system.
But so far it has achieved only modest market penetration, and only as a "server" system on large networks, not on individual desktops.
Microsoft has sought to smooth the journey to Windows 95 and 32-bit computing by seeing to it that all existing 16-bit software will run on the new system, but it's not likely to be a totally painless trip.
The installed base of Windows applications insures that Windows 95 will have strong sales, but it presents the possibility of compatibility problems.
A version of Windows 95 for the PowerPC chip is not likely to materialize, unless I.B.M., Apple and others achieve unexpected sales volume.
Windows is written in software code that ties it closely to the internal workings of the Intel chip, and to convert it would be a major undertaking.
Windows NT, however, can run on many chips, and a version for the PowerPC is in the works.
One ace up I.B.M.'s sleeve is development of a much publicized but never officially confirmed version of the PowerPC microprocessor that incorporates emulation into the chip itself.
In theory, this hardware emulation would allow machines using the chip to run Windows applications at speeds so close to their "native" performance on Intel boxes that the difference would be moot.
With the added benefit of running Macintosh, OS/2, Unix and Windows NT applications, such a machine would appeal to shops using a mix of hardware.
But the performance of this mystery chip or of the coming joint Apple-I.B.M. computer design had better be good.
"The real challenge they face is having compatibility real enough and fast enough, because the installed base is everything," said a PC buyer for a Big Six accounting firm, who spoke on the condition he not to be identified.
"It better be double the performance" of competing machines, "because it's not like PC makers or Microsoft are gouging on price," he said.
Others say outperforming Microsoft and Intel at their own game is a long shot.
They see the new machine as a Mac clone.
Apple has said it will license its operating system when the hardware specification is complete; in any case one could purchase Mac OS separately and run it on the new machine.
In addition to I.B.M., Apple and Motorola, companies developing or producing PowerPC-based machines include: Bull Systems, Canon, FirePower, Hitachi, Power Computing, 3DO, the Taiwan New PC Consortium and Toshiba.
Many are likely to seek Mac OS licenses when Apple makes them available.
"Where I.B.M. and Apple would have a real advantage is if they would combine their operating systems," said John McKenna, president of Entex Information Systems in Ryebrook, N.Y., which claims to be the largest reseller of PC's to corporate customers.
"Suppose I.B.M. were to throw all its weight behind integrating the Mac operating system."
It would be no large task for I.B.M. to add its own extensions to the Macintosh that would make it an ideal "client" in networked computer systems using I.B.M.'s mainframes and minicomputers.
But for I.B.M. to fully embrace the Macintosh operating system would seem a step back from its commitment to the OS/2 operating system, on which it has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars.
Similarly, for Apple, the prospect of licensing Mac OS to the company it once equated with George Orwell's Big Brother must cause at least a mild shudder.
"The real question," said Seymour Merrin, a consultant to the PC industry who is based in Mountain View, Calif., "is whether any product can be developed by I.B.M. and Apple when their own businesses are the biggest obstacle to anything getting done,"


BENNINGTON MEANS BUSINESS
Two observations, with respect to Edmundson's article: It is ironic that, in its fiscal make-over, Bennington solicited input from students and professors but made its restructuring decisions by the fiat of its president, Elizabeth Coleman.
Perhaps the moral is, don't ask unless you are prepared to listen.

In the Region/Westchester; New in an Office Park: A Detached Day-Care Center
IT might seem surprising in this age of corporate austerity, with office space going begging, that a new building is going up at the Westchester Corporate Park in Harrison, and right next door to a five-story building that's only 70 percent occupied.
But this project is not intended for the traditional office clientele, but rather for children, aged 8 weeks to 5 years old, who will attend the Eastridge Enrichment Center, the first free-standing day-care center to be built in a Westchester corporate park.


Say 'Oh, Jolly Good!' Or 'Awesome!' or Both
The retro style, mixing earlier decades with the present, was seen on and off the fashion runways in recent weeks.
On the streets of Paris a lace-trimmed coat from the early 1900's (top, second from left) and on Madison Avenue a young couple in new clothes, all in black (top, second from right), recalled the Edwardian period.
A woman on Fifth Avenue (top, far right) wore a 1940 profile hat with a circa 1949 jacket.
Rakishly tilted doll hats of the late 30's (far left) were seen in New York (top) and in Paris (bottom).
And a trumpet-shaped skirt, circa 1950, was mixed (left) with a 40's jacket, feather boa, tilted hat and fur-cuffed boots.
Young men have joined the retro act, too: mixing a 40's tie, a 50's cardigan sweater and a late 50's velour hat decorated with toothpicks (above); reviving the 1950's London banker style with chalk-stripe suit and homburg hat (right), and imitating the stevedore style of the 20's and 30's with suspenders, plaid shirt and tweed trousers, vest and cap (bottom, far right).


A Question Of Safety: A special report.; Troubles at USAir: Coincidence or More?
As USAir Flight 565 reached cruising altitude of 33,000 feet last Feb. 22, the pilots made a chilling discovery -- their DC-9, carrying 62 passengers from Washington to Boston, might not have enough fuel to reach its destination.
Radioing for an emergency landing at New York's La Guardia Airport, the pilots claimed the plane had engine trouble.
Only after the jet had landed safely and the ground crew had discovered the fuel situation did the captain acknowledge that there was no engine problem.
Behind schedule in Washington, workers had neglected to refuel the plane and the pilots had not checked the gauges before takeoff.

Climate Change Played a Role in India's Plague
To the Editor:
Re " 'Emperors of Garbage' " (Op-Ed, Nov. 5): "India's plagues are self-inflicted," reads the subheadline on Inderjit Badhwar's article, which blames Government neglect for India's epidemics.
Social inequities and widespread wastes provide the setting.
But there is another aspect: worldwide climate changes also contributed to the plague.
Last summer India's temperatures reached 124 degrees Fahrenheit, and animal carcasses were scattered across the plains.
Houses, abandoned after the Maharashtra earthquake the year before, became furnaces in blasting heat; stuffed with stored grains, they generated clouds of fleas.
Pneumonic plague was first reported in Beed district of Maharashtra state last August.


The Aging Process Holds Few Fears For This Troupe
EVERYTHING ABOUT JIRI kylian as a choreographer has an original touch.
So it comes as no surprise that creativity runs through all levels of the three-tier organization he directs under the title of Netherlands Dance Theater (N.D.T.).
Like a growing number of troupes, the original Netherlands Dance Theater, now called N.D.T. 1, has a junior ensemble.
In N.D.T. 2, young dancers serve a professional apprenticeship, performing new works and pieces no longer danced by the senior company.
Nonetheless, N.D.T. 3, the group Mr.
Kylian founded for dancers over 40, is the most captivating of all, anything but the geriatric alumni association its very concept might suggest.


POSTINGS: Opposite Madison Square Garden; Sports Store For Midtown
The Sports Authority, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based retailer with more than 100 outlets nationwide and 18 in the tristate area, will open its first New York City store Tuesday in 40,000 square feet in the Hotel Pennsylvania, at Seventh Avenue and 32d Street.
The Sports Authority, a subsidiary of Kmart, chose the location "because they wouldn't move Madison Square Garden for us," said Vince Osborne, a marketing executive at the company.
Mark I. Walker, The Sports Authority's vice president for real estate, said the store was opening at least a year ahead of schedule.
"The opportunity for this location arose and we jumped on it at once," he said.

Back of Beyond In Peru
Don Oscar Arce Caceres, our guide, was eager to hack through vertical jungle to verify his observation.
Peter, Tina and I -- and our two mule drivers, Pedro and Segundo -- were less enthusiastic.
On this golden Andean eminence, 12,000 feet above sea level, mystery seemed better than certainty, especially if certainty required uphill climbing.


Churches Lead Dual Lives With Separate Congregations
EVERY Sunday morning at 10 o'clock, members of the Closter Congregational Church gather for their weekly worship service.
Finding a choice pew is easy.
With the entire congregation of 40 people in attendance, there's plenty of room in the 110-seat sanctuary.
The situation is different on Sunday afternoons.
At 1 o'clock, the 60 families of the Gillbot Church of Closter, a Korean congregation, meet to worship under the leadership of their pastor, the Rev.
Min Woong Kim.
The members also meet for Bible study on Wednesday nights and hold youth group meetings at other times in the Congregational Church building.


San Antonio
It is almost always fiesta time in San Antonio, America's 10th-largest city and, by some reckonings, the place where Latin America begins.
But there may be no better time of year to visit than this season, when there is much joyful anticipation of the holidays in the air.
The holidays in San Antonio bring the Fiesta de las Luminarias, when more than 2,500 candles line the city's River Walk and cast a soft, bewitching glow along the San Antonio River.
The luminarias -- candlelighted, sand-filled paper lanterns -- symbolize the lighting of the Holy Family's path, in a tradition dating from the 1500's.


Fearless, Boundless And Ready to Depart
Martina Navratilova has dreamed it, dreaded it, dined on it, decoded it with astrologers and tarot cards; retirement has been fraught with peril and possibility.
And now, immediacy.
The late tennis sage Ted Tinling once pigeonholed Navratilova as a gloriously mortal champion whose on-court attitude "ranged from arrogance to panic with nothing in between." Her attitude toward retirement, which could descend as soon as Tuesday and no later than Sunday, is much the same.


The Medium Is All These TV Books
IT was bound to happen.
Like a ravenous Klingon, television has already devoured much of popular culture.
Music is ruled by MTV.
Hollywood cannot recycle reruns -- "The Fugitive," "The Flintstones" -- fast enough.
And, hip journalists, who in another age might have sprinkled their prose with references to Adonis and Croesus, now evoke Keith Partridge and Thurston Howell 3d.
So it should surprise no one that the last great frontier -- the printed word -- should begin to fall before the mighty cathode-ray tube.
The charge is beginning with seemingly harmless homages that empower readers to relive those golden moments as couch potatoes.
"The Partridge Family" has a book.
So does "The Addams Family," "The Munsters," "Cheers," "Seinfeld," "Mission Impossible," "Get Smart," and "Mister Ed" (of course, of course).
From the "I'm not a doctor, but I play one of TV" department, this week's The New York Times's list of best sellers includes a collection of essays on marriage by Paul Reiser, the star of "Mad About You," and meditations on life by Tim "Home Improvement" Allen.


Four Decades Later, an Atypical Artist Nears a Retrospective
THE paintings and sculpture at Stamford Center for the Arts are, by his own admission, the closest Robert Goodnough has come to a retrospective.
For an artist who has been on the Manhattan scene since 1950, this is remarkable enough; but for one who has shown in galleries as prestigious as Tibor de Nagy and Andre Emmerich, not to mention the Albright-Knox, in Buffalo, it is downright mysterious.
But then there is little that is typical in Mr.
Goodnough's career, which begins with his being included, along with Franz Kline, Larry Rivers, Al Leslie and others, in a 1950 "new talent" show organized by Clement Greenberg and Meyer Schapiro for the Kootz Gallery.
Two years later, the young man (who had attended Syracuse University and served in the Army during World War II) started out with Amedee Ozenfant and Hans Hofmann, had his first solo at Tibor de Nagy, where he remained for 20 years.
Goodnough was to become, among other things, cause for comment in the 1981 autobiography written by John Bernard Myers, poet, entrepreneur and director of the gallery.

State to Defend Dismissed Troopers in Lawsuit
David Harding and Robert Lishansky were dismissed by the New York State Police after they admitted fabricating evidence in more than two dozen criminal cases.
Both are now in prison.
But because of a quirk in the law, the state could spend as much as $100,000 to defend them in a civil suit charging them with faking evidence in a murder investigation.


NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST VALLAGE -- A Second Avenue Farewell, a Bowery Debut; Fillmore's Next Act: The Wrecking Ball
Say "Fillmore East," and many people think of the golden age of rock.
Under the direction of the impresario Bill Graham, headliners on the stage at 105 Second Avenue included the likes of B. B. King, Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, the Grateful Dead and Otis Redding.
Concerts often lasted till dawn; legend has it that Ike Turner once fired a pearl-handled pistol into the pavement to clear a way through the crowd for Tina and the Ikettes.
But in truth, the Fillmore's reign was brief, from 1968-71.
And it was just one of a number of incarnations for the building -- they included a silent-movie house, a Yiddish theater and gay disco -- that reflect the changing times and neighborhood.
Now it seems on track for demolition, to be replaced by an apartment house, with 20 percent of its units to be subsidized for low- and moderate-income tenants.


It's Not the Only Alien Invader
THREE MORNINGS A WEEK, DANIELLE KITAOKA rises at 3 A.M. and drives the 20 minutes from her home in Kaneohe, on the island of Oahu, to Honolulu International Airport, where she works as an inspector for the Hawaii Department of Agriculture.
She makes a few calls from her office, then swings by the department's dog kennel near the airport to pick up an eager beagle named Columbo.
Her main task for the day begins promptly at 6 with the arrival from Guam of Continental Flight 934.
"I'm on the shift because the other inspector started to burn out," Kitaoka said recently as she stood on the Tarmac at the appointed hour, watching the jetliner pull up to its gate.
A small, freckle-faced woman in her late 20's, Kitaoka did not sound pleased at her assignment.
"I'm not a morning person," she muttered.


Sound Bytes; The Serenity of a Loner
DAN BRICKLIN'S story is an industry legend.
At the Harvard Business School in 1979, he imagined a concept for computing complex cash and balance-sheet projections.
Mr.
Bricklin decided to build his electronic spreadsheet and, with his colleague Robert Frankston, created Visicalc, the forerunner of products like Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft's Excel.
Unfortunately, a series of business problems left Mr.
Bricklin watching as others, like Mitchell Kapor and Bill Gates, made billions.
He has spent the last 15 years writing award-winning software tools, but none has had the impact of the electronic spreadsheet.
His latest product, Dan Bricklin's Overall Viewer, a visual way to display information in Windows-based software, was released this month.


How the Voters In the Suburbs Boosted Pataki
VOTERS in the New York City suburbs played a pivotal role in George E. Pataki's victory last week, sending him to the Executive Mansion with a margin of victory that far exceeded his statewide performance.
Interviews with 379 voters leaving polling places in the seven counties immediately north of New York City and on Long Island indicated that 60 percent voted for Mr.
Pataki compared with 38 percent for Mario M. Cuomo, whose 12 years in Albany came to an abrupt end.
The race statewide was much closer.
With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr.
Pataki, a State Senator from Putnam County and former Mayor of Peekskill, had 48 percent of the vote.
Mr.
Cuomo, a longtime Queens resident, had 45 percent.

Ms.
Ast will keep her name.
She graduated from Spring Hill College.
She is a daughter of the late Margaret and Henry M. Johnston.


Leadership, Equality and Violence on Bishops' Agenda
In their first meeting since Pope John Paul II "definitively" ruled out the possibility of female ordination, the nation's Roman Catholic bishops are convening in Washington this week for discussions on promoting church leadership and equality for women.
Similar issues will confront the members of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in debates on the use of inclusive -- or gender neutral -- language in certain parts of the liturgy, an area in which past efforts have been stymied by the Vatican and by conservative clerics in the United States

Man Dies in Subway In Fall From Train
A man walking between the cars of a No. 1 subway in upper Manhattan fell onto the tracks yesterday morning and was killed when he was run over by the train, the police said.
The body of the man, Wilson Nunez, 25, of the Bronx, lay about 50 feet north of the 116th Street subway station for several hours as other trains passed, before a conductor on another train noticed it, investigators said.
They said that the body, which was lying near the southbound local track, had been decapitated.


SUNDAY, November 13. 1994; It's God, Gas and Go At Virginia Church
It's a place of worship.
It's a gas station.
It's Arlington Temple United Methodist Church.
Newcomers to Rosslyn, Va., a suburb of Washington, often gawk at the odd structure.
But locals breezily refer to it as "Our Lady of Exxon."
The Rev.
Jack Sawyer, the church's pastor, doesn't mind at all.
"People can call us whatever they want," he says.
"We're happy to have them here. We're happy with Exxon too."


Ethics Panel Opens Inquiry Into Activities Of Gingrich

Gingrich taught at the Kennesaw State College in Marietta, Ga., last year, examined contemporary political issues through a conservative lens.

The bride, 28, graduated from Brown University.
She is a marketing coordinator at Lehrer McGovern Bovis, a construction management firm in New York.
Her father is a founding partner of Kohn Pedersen Fox Architects in New York.
Her mother is a psychoanalyst in Greenwich, Conn.


Two Women Who Break A Tradition
Samuel Phillips founded a boarding school for boys here in 1778.
Three years later, his uncle, Dr.
John Phillips, founded one in Exeter, N.H., on the other side of the border.
In the 200 years since, the two academies bearing the Phillips name have enjoyed a friendly rivalry that has endured, becoming a beloved tradition.
Tradition is a big deal here.
The schools, which are not officially affiliated, share a seal originally cut by Paul Revere; a motto, Finis Origine Pendet, which means "the end depends upon the beginning," and an annual football game, where they contest their rivalry with pigskin and shoulder pads.
And at the game every year, in the name of good sportsmanship, the leaders of the two schools walk onto the field at halftime for a handshake.


That Was Then, Y'All, This Is Now
For "Gone With The Wind" purists, Scarlett and Rhett wil always be Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.
But when the eight-hour mini-series "Scarlet" begins tonight at 9 on CBS, finding Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton (large photo, center) in the lead roles may be the least of the purists' concerns.
What's amazing is how much the world, especially the Old South, seems to have changed between the time "Gone With The Wind"" ends (with the death of Melanie Hamilton Wilkes) and its sequel, "Scarlett," begins (with Melanie's funeral, persumably just a few days later).


13 Musicians From County Appearing at Kennedy Center
THIRTEEN music students ranging in age from 8 to 17 will be on their way to Washington this week to take part in a national arts festival at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
The group, selected in a nationwide competition sponsored by the National Guild of Community Schools of the Arts, includes eight youngsters from the Westchester Conservatory of Music in White Plains and five from the Hoff-Barthelson Music School in Scarsdale.
A concert next Saturday from 2 to 4 P.M. will feature performances by the National Guild Youth Symphony, the Jazz Band and the Festival Youth Choir.
Four instrumentalists from the conservatory -- Adam Hollander, oboist, and Christopher Tai, Noah Gedrich and Roger Peng, violinists -- and two from Hoff-Barthelson -- Katrin Stamatis, violinist, and Christoph Gillet, french horn player -- will play in the orchestra, which will be led by Lukas Foss.
The violinist Elmar Oliveira will be the featured soloist.
The Festival Youth Choir will be led by Henry Leck.

The Knicks Finally Fall, With a Thud
The Knicks' first loss of the season was a decisive one.
They never threatened in the fourth quarter.
They were thoroughly outplayed by the San Antonio Spurs.
And for the Knicks, it was an ominous beginning to a challenging four-game trip.
Led by David Robinson's 35-point, 13-rebound performance, the Spurs rolled to a 101-82 victory tonight at the Alamodome, ending New York's season-opening three-game winning streak.


Settling Matters in Oklahoma
According to a published report, university officials are trying to negotiate a settlement with Oklahoma Coach GARY GIBBS so he will resign before the new school president, DAVID BOREN, takes office on Thursday.

Car Rental Companies Raise Their Rates
The Hertz Corporation recently raised its rates, leading to a scramble by other major rental-car companies to follow suit.
A Hertz spokesman said the 8 to 10 percent increase was overdue, reflecting higher car prices.
The rental increases are $3 to $5 in daily rates, $2 in weekend rates and $10 to $20 in weekly rates.
National Car Rental also raised most of its rates, initially 8 to 12 percent, followed at the end of last month by another 2 percent wherever competition allowed.


NOV. 6-12: Color of Cash; Black Company Buys Denny's Franchises
For years, thousands of black customers dining at Denny's restaurants have complained of stark bigotry, including being made to pay for their meals in advance or wait longer than white patrons or being refused service altogether.
Such incidents formed the basis of two Federal suits, representing more than 4,300 people, and Denny's agreed to settled them last May for $54 million.
While Denny's, owned by Flagstar Companies of Spartanburg, S.C., has denied any corporate policy of prejudice, it is struggling to shed its racist stigma.

Samaritan Van Halts Good Deeds
THE Texaco Good Samaritan Van, which had been aiding stranded motorists on county roads since 1988, ceased operation early this month because of the lack of a sponsor.
But supporters are signing petitions in hopes that the Governor's office will assist in finding a new sponsor.
The white Ford van is owned and operated by Samaritania Inc. of Franklin, Mass.
The $120,000 yearly operating cost is paid by a sponsor, which is allowed to put its name on the van's side.
CVS, the drugstore chain, was the original sponsor in 1987, but Texaco took over a year later.
For six hours a day during rush hours, the van provided free help to needy motorists along Interstate 287 and nearby roads.


Silk Stocking Race Didn't Fit Mold
In a year when Republican challengers toppled Democratic Congressional incumbents across the nation, Charles Millard seemed like a strong prospect to win back Manhattan's fabled "Silk Stocking" District for the G.O.P.
His Democratic opponent, Carolyn B. Maloney, appeared vulnerable as a freshman who had squeaked into office by 2 percentage points in 1992.
Their contest fast became the city's hardest-fought Congressional battle this year, and easily the most expensive, with nearly $2 million in campaign spending.
Pundits and consultants rated it a tossup.


TRULY GROSS ECONOMIC PRODUCT
A recent report on why Americans continue to gain weight blames the automobile and television, but mostly the auto.
Most television watching is done at night, when people are not doing much anyway.
Cars are used during the prime activity hours, when our ancestors would have been hunting and gathering food.
Our bodies were designed to walk.

Clashing Styles or Bad Manners?
To the Editor:
Barbara Presley Noble's commentary on Deborah Tannen's latest book dismisses the idea that there are important differences between the way in which women and men communicate.
In Ms.
Noble's analysis, any gender-based differences in communication style are "trivial" and may be attributed to "bad manners." A more productive approach to analyzing Dr.
Tannen's work would have included a discussion about what these differences mean for managing in today's changing and uncertain environment.

From Page to Screen With Critter and Elf
Purchasers of a CD-ROM from Living Books are supplied with a paper copy of the original "dead" book along with the CD-ROM adaptation.
I bet that most children never get around to opening the real book.
The computer version delivers not only the illustrations and complete text, in multiple languages (want Japanese? No problem), but also a captivating soundtrack and a host of interactive distractions.
GRANDMA AND ME, by Mercer Mayer (for Macintosh and Windows; Living Books, $39.95 suggested; ages 2 to 5) was the first in the series and remains the standard-bearer of the Living Books line.
The protagonist is Mr.
Mayer's well-known Little Critter, an unflaggingly cute little fellow whose bloodlines apparently descend from chipmunk and woodchuck.
In this episode, Critter's sprightly Grandma accompanies him on a beach outing.
The story harbors very little conflict -- save a tussle with a crab -- but much charm.
The viewer can choose to have the story read aloud, much as it might have been before electronic media, or watch it unfold in a more free-form style.
As each virtual page appears on the screen, a voice reads the brief text (each word lights up as it is sounded), and then the real fun begins.
The screen becomes a playground; almost every character and object on the screen is now a "hot button" for an amusing animated sequence; touch the sand castle, for instance, and a little phalanx of bugs marches out over a drawbridge.
It's all you can ask for in computer entertainment, really -- a reading lesson dressed up as an interactive cartoon.


Cashing Checks
To the Editor: In September, on my first trip to Germany, I changed American Express traveler's checks into German marks at three banks with appalling results.
In Bonn, I was charged a 16 percent service charge, in Rudesheim, 19 percent, and in Speyer, 26 percent.
I asked the manager to return my traveler's checks and I would give back the money.
He refused, saying that the transaction had already been made.


BENNINGTON MEANS BUSINESS
I found Mark Edmundson's article on the changes at Bennington fair and objective.
But he neglected to mention the dilemma facing recent Bennington graduates: How do we support our beloved school (which may not survive without our financial help) without feeling that we are betraying the teachers -- our friends -- who were so rudely and unnecessarily dismissed?
I find no easy answer.

PRO FOOTBALL: TV Sports; Want to See Cowboys And 49ers? Start the Car.
Today, we are a city in tears.
We shall not see the Dallas-San Francisco game on broadcast television.
At 1 P.M., New York-area viewers will watch the Arizona-Giants game on Fox (Channel 5), followed at 4 by the Jets-Green Bay game on NBC (Channel 4).
The Super Bowl, at least of Week 11, will only be a highlight special. 'Tis the shame of America.
The pity of football.
In fact, only about 80 percent of the country's viewers can flick on their remotes today at 4 P.M. to watch the Cowboys (8-1) play the 49ers (7-2).


Discontent Proves Mild In the State
CONNECTICUT voters expressed considerably less anger last Tuesday than did their counterparts nationally, surveys of voters leaving the polls suggest, but enough of the discontented rallied behind John G. Rowland in a four-way race to elect the state's first Republican Governor in 24 years.
Mr.
Rowland also succeeded in his second attempt at the Governor's office, however, because his supporters -- predominantly white residents of wealthy suburbs and working-class towns -- turned out in large numbers, while many of the state's most disaffected residents -- minorities in the cities -- stayed home.
As a result, the 36.2 percent of the vote that gave Mr.
Rowland his victory represents a narrow slice of Connecticut both demographically and geographically: 97 percent white, and heavily drawn from the two Congressional districts encompassing the southwestern part of the state.


The best, the brightest and 'The Bell Curve.'
To the Editor:
The decline in average I.Q. scores would be most upsetting if one did not recall the large number of individuals with above-average I.Q.'s who made incredibly stupid decisions over recent decades in banking, insurance and politics.

DUMBING DOWN
Henig must believe, along with Vince Lombardi, that winning isn't everything, it's the only thing.
She seems to think it's fine for parents to greet each other socially by exchanging information on their children's test scores.

Fresh Herbs Add a Hint of the Exotic to Desserts
MINT is losing its monopoly.
Other fresh green herbs that have long been associated with savory dishes, not sweets, have begun showing up on dessert plates in restaurants.
Chefs have found that some fresh herbs, notably rosemary, tarragon and basil, can provide a lovely, if unexpected, whiff of fragrance and flavor.
Home cooks can easily follow suit.
Why not garnish that apple tart with a sprig of tarragon, crush some rosemary into the lemon sorbet or add basil to an orange custard?


Fiddling With Psyches
To the Editor:
In her article "Cover Your Eyes, Quick"  [ Oct. 30 ] , Betsy Sharkey and the people she quotes implicitly accept the fact that depicting gratuitous, graphic violence is O.K.
Widespread cultural despair must explain why no one questions whether such displays of sadism and murder are appropriate or necessary to entertainment, only to what degree they may be pushed upon the viewer.


Compaq Storms the PC Heights From its Factory Floor
A YEAR ago, Eckhard Pfeiffer caused a stir in the personal computer industry when he predicted that the Compaq Computer Corporation would be No.1 by 1996.
At the time, Compaq was ranked third, behind I.B.M. and Apple.
Rivals and analysts chided the Compaq president, calling his remarks arrogant, even foolhardy, given the notoriously volatile nature of the personal computer business.


A Mannered Duchess, Buzzing at the Whitney
UPTOWN -- On Nov. 9, the Duchess of York was quietly holed up in a room at the back of F. A. O. Schwarz, signing 200 copies of her "Budgie the Little Helicopter" books.
Outside, a crowd of parents and children had flooded the toy store for its "Light Up a Life" benefit for New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
Among the entertainers waiting to perform were the Flying Karamazov Brothers, four American jester-princes with hippie roots and perpetually raised eyebrows who will be opening on Broadway later this month.
In white tie and tails, with their hair tied back, they amused themselves while waiting for the Duchess to make her appearance, doing some verbal juggling with her reputation.

Science Fiction
"Nan-" or "nano-": a prefix derived from the Latin word for dwarf.
Used by scientists to denote the very, very small, as in "nanosecond," a billionth of a second.
Used by science fiction writers in combination with the suffix "-tech" to refer to tiny machines that function on a molecular or even atomic scale.
QUEEN CITY JAZZ (Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95), by Kathleen Ann Goonan, is a dizzying novel that takes full advantage of the creative potential of nanotech.
Imagine a technology capable of transforming matter on the most intimate level, a technology that finds it no more difficult to rewire a human brain from the inside than to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
Literally.


Bitter Tone of the '94 Campaign Elicits Worry on Public Debate
Campaigns are the conversation of democracy, and the one that just concluded was angry, deeply personal, powerfully ideological and exceedingly negative -- sometimes all at once.
Now that the shouting is over, many scholars and political professionals say that it was also a conversation that carried the country somewhere, a rough debate about the country's direction that ended with a stunningly loud judgment from the voters.

D. H. Lawrence Seen In One Intense Lens
The Story of a Marriage  By Brenda Maddox  Illustrated. 620 pages.
Simon &amp; Schuster. $30.
Brenda Maddox's idea of viewing D. H. Lawrence's stormy life through the prism of his marriage to Baroness Frieda von Richthofen Weekley makes good sense, at least on the face of it.
After all, so many memoirs and studies have been written about fragments of Lawrence's life -- his youth, his writings, his travels, his relations with one or another individual -- that he demands to be captured "between two covers," as Ms.
Maddox puts it.

Blocked Path Costs Seton Hall Runner
Bryan Spoonire, a senior at Seton Hall, will learn Monday whether his appeal will be upheld by the National Collegiate Athletic Association so he can run in the Division I cross-country championships Nov. 21 in Fayetteville, Ark.
Spoonire and three other leading runners took a wrong turn late in the men's IC4A 10,000-meter race here Saturday.
The incident was caused by spectators blocking the correct path.
Spoonire, who had beaten Saturday's winner, Villanova's Louie Quinitana (30 minutes 12 seconds), two weeks ago on this same Franklin Park course during the Big East championships, eventually finished in 33d place, too far back to qualify for the N.C.A.A.'s.


For New York City's OTB, A Sure Bet Ends Up a Loser
When New York City went into the bookmaking business in 1971, its officials envisioned that their monopoly franchise would ultimately yield annual profits of $200 million.
As it turns out, their projection was off -- by just a little more than $200 million.
Over the last two years the Offtrack Betting Corporation has become "the only bookie operation in the world to lose money," as Rudolph W. Giuliani liked to point out during the 1993 mayoral campaign.
Since then, OTB's operating deficit has quintupled, reaching $5.3 million for the fiscal year that ended in June.

Clinton, on Asia Trip, Faces a Rougher Road
As President Clinton began meetings here with Asian and Pacific leaders including China's President, Administration officials said today that he would offer reassurances that the setbacks suffered by the Democrats in last Tuesday's elections would not disrupt American policy in the region.
Mr.
Clinton's advisers said he nevertheless expected to be questioned, and perhaps tested, on the new limits to his power.
Now that his party has lost control of the House and Senate, some said the President would appear weaker to his counterparts than in any meeting with foreign leaders since he took office 22 months ago.

The memories of six players occupying various generations intercut and overlap, and Mr.
Hoiby's gracious songfulness smooths their way.


No Bench Warmers Here


A Comeback With Energy To Spare
Few bands are as exhausting to watch as the Proclaimers, who performed on Thursday night at Tramps.
Playing one rousing song after another, belting choruses until they were red in the face and pounding on their instruments to accentuate every backbeat, the twins Craig and Charlie Reid put on a performance that was as much a sporting event as a music concert.
With a four-member backing band, the Scottish brothers conjured up the ghosts of 1950's doo-wop, soul and rhythm-and-blues but substituted muscle and adrenaline for emotion and ache.
The Proclaimers might have been over and done with after they released two well-received albums in the 1980's, but when a four-year-old song of theirs, "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)," was revived for the film "Benny and Joon" last year, these latter-day Everly Brothers returned.
Their most recent album, "Hit the Highway" (Chrysalis/ERG), crammed with songs about love, religion and family, certainly justifies their comeback.


An Official Says Industry Can Police Policy-Buying
Brian D. Pardo, president of the National Viatical Association and Life Partners Inc., both of Waco, Tex., has long argued that the industry can police itself and does not need outside regulators.
"We allow sick people to sell their cars and homes without regulation," he said in a recent interview.


Plays That Cast an Irreverent Eye Over Two Revered Playwrights
The worlds portrayed in the plays of Tennessee Williams and Sam Shepard may be enlightening places to visit, but who on earth would want to live there?
Christopher Durang, who has devoted most of his work to talking back to a hostile and arbitrary universe, has taken up his satirist's pen to enter the hostile and arbitrary terrain created by these titanic American playwrights in "Durang Durang," an evening of short plays.
He responds as he has always responded to the presence of something grave and inherently tragic: he laughs, a trifle nervously, perhaps, but very loudly.
The odds are that you will, too.


The Battle Over Artificial Snow
Whooshing downhill across blankets of snow on the Rocky Mountain slopes, skiers and snow-boarders are exulting once again in the thrilling joy rides and magnificent vistas of a sport that prides itself on being harmoniously in step with the rhythms of nature.
But sometimes, it turns out, nature falls out of step, failing to drop enough snow to meet the early demand for skiers.
So technology steps in.
The fluffy blankets on the trails at the Loveland resort here, for example, were largely produced by snow guns using water pumped from nearby streams.


Bump And Grin: German Wins Title
The 1994 Formula One season, dogged by tragedy and controversy, ended yesterday in a most fitting manner: an anticlimax.
Michael Schumacher, whose domination of Formula One was clouded by penalties and suspensions that barred him from one-fourth of the 16-race season, still clinched the title yesterday in the final race, the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide.
Schumacher, 25, is the first German world champion since the creation of the modern Formula One auto racing series in 1950.


In Prague, a New Daily for English Speakers
The first English-language daily newspaper in Eastern Europe since the collapse of Communism is to be introduced on Monday by a young American publisher who has made a name here with a daily fax publication.

Irish Premier Says Threat to Coalition Impedes Peace Initiative
Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said today that a threat by the Labor Party to break up his coalition Government would impede efforts toward peace in Northern Ireland.
Labor Party members threatened on Friday to pull out after Mr.

Labor ministers walked out of the Cabinet meeting, protesting that they had not been consulted on the appointment, and it was pushed through after they left.

For the first time, the Mariners (7-2) of Kings Point, L.I., were included in the 16-team field for the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III tournament.
In the first round, they will play Plymouth State, the undefeated New England titan, at Plymouth, N.H.


Bosnian Army Fights to Hold Areas Taken From Serbs
Fighting continued today in northwestern Bosnia as Muslim-led Government forces battled to maintain their hold on territory captured from Bosnian Serb forces and endured artillery attacks from Serbs in Croatia.
United Nations military officials said Bosnian Army troops defending the Bihac pocket had repulsed two attempts by Bosnian Serb forces.
And the Sarajevo radio reported tonight that the southern edge of the enclave had been pounded with artillery based in a Serb-held area of Croatia that is under the supervision of United Nations peacekeepers.


Disney Mulls Big Florida Expansion
The Walt Disney Company is close to approving the investment of as much as $2 billion to expand Disney World, its theme park in Orlando, Fla., a person close to the company said yesterday.
In considering the expansion, Disney is trying to address two problems: a general slide in attendance at Disney World in the last few years and increasing competition from another Orlando theme park, Universal Studios/Florida, owned by MCA .
MCA is planning to add 4,000 hotel rooms at Universal Studios.


Clinton Meets China's President During Trade Talks in Indonesia


Siberia's Oil Keeps Spilling
In Alaska, an oil spill like the one that happened in the Russian Arctic this summer and fall would be called an unmitigated disaster, unleashing a national media frenzy.
In Russia, the reaction could hardly have been more different.
It wasn't a sudden spill.
An old pipeline operated by the state oil company apparently wore out, developing leaks along its 32-mile length.
Estimates of the magnitude vary wildly, from 4 million to 80 million gallons. (The Exxon Valdez spill was 11 million gallons.) But whatever the cause and the size, an immediate, full-scale response is imperative.


Editorial Notebook; Lessons of the Plague
The plague outbreak that struck India this year caused more panic than was warranted.
The sudden appearance of this ancient scourge sent hundreds of thousands of residents fleeing from the industrial city of Surat, igniting fears that they would spread the contagion to the jam-packed slums of India's major cities.
Apprehensive nations cut off air travel and trade with India; tourists and conference groups canceled trips.
But when a World Health Organization team completed a 10-day inspection recently, the picture seemed far less frightening.
The plague was limited to two outbreaks in areas far from the usual tourist haunts and business venues.
Not a single case of transmission was confirmed elsewhere in the vast country.
Indeed, the epidemic burned out as fast as it began, leaving it hard to escape the feeling that if the plague scare was not exactly a false alarm, it was surely an excessive alarm.


Prank Ends in Arrest of 2 Rutgers Students
As fraternity pranks go, this one lacked daring, but it nonetheless landed two Rutgers students in jail.
Late Saturday night, Michael Papa, 18, of Farmingdale, L.I., and Michael Ziemak, 19, of Jersey City, both students at Rutgers University, stole the hat off the head of a doorman at the Trump Towers apartment complex on Fifth Avenue, the police said.
The men then raced through midtown.
The prank was apparently part of pledge activities for the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity, the police said.

At 633 License Suspensions, The Top Scofflaw Is Arrested
He called himself Bobby Leonard or Harvey Linen, Leroy Linden or something else, and he used various addresses, real and unreal, the police said.
But the officers who nabbed him in the Bronx Saturday night called him New York City's top scofflaw -- a phantom motorist whose license has been suspended 633 times since 1990, once every two or three days, on average.
More than a year after the Police Department created a list of 100 most wanted drivers with the worst suspension records, and a task force to hunt them down, the No. 1 suspect, Leroy Linen, 41, was in custody yesterday, facing a felony charge as the Jesse James of Scofflaws.

He had weekend invitations to dinners in New York and to a gala hosted by Donald T. DiFrancesco, the New Jersey Senate President, but he decided to kick back, put his feet up and relax.


When Bad Things Happen To Bad Teams
Twenty minutes after the Giants had lost on a bizarre, late play to the Arizona Cardinals, Michael Strahan sat motionless at his locker.
His teammates had undressed, but the Giant defensive end just sat there, staring, his equipment still strapped on.
He was stunned.
The coach was stunned.
The team was stunned.
Few players had the words to describe how they felt.
After taking a 9-0 lead over an Arizona team whose offense is so bad and predictable it looked like something out of "Jurassic Park," the Giants finally thought they would win one.


Gunning for Wife, Man Kills Sister-in-Law and Himself
After what neighbors said was an escalating nightmare of violence and desperation, a man searching for his estranged wife in Queens Saturday night killed his sister-in-law, wounded his brother-in-law and then killed himself, the police said.
The man's wife was not at the house and was not injured.


For Assembly and Senate, Slim Changes
This was a banner election for the downtrodden Republicans in the New York Assembly, their best showing since 1968.
Yet the six new seats amounted to a few crumpled dollar bills against the vast currency of the Democrats, who have controlled the body for 20 years and still hold nearly a two-to-one margin.
Nor did much happen to alter the balance of power in the New York Senate, where Republicans have been in control, except for a quirk in 1965, since Herbert H. Lehman occupied the Executive Mansion in 1938.

Election Has Altered Regulatory Landscape
In addition to denying the Clinton Administration the power to set a legislative agenda for the 104th Congress, it is now becoming clear that last week's elections will make it more difficult for the White House to assert its social and political priorities by issuing new regulations.
Before the election, the Administration had hoped to accomplish through regulation some of the things that the 103d Congress had refused to do through legislation, like tightening environmental restrictions on mining.

Harlem Dreams Are Revived For Trade Center and Hotel
Nearly given up for dead after more than five years of delays, the long-awaited plan to build an international trade center and hotel on West 125th Street in Harlem appears to be back on track.
On Thursday, the state's Urban Development Corporation is expected to approve a revised plan for a 22-story complex at 125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard (formerly Lenox Avenue).
The U.D.C.'s approval would clear the way for the next phases of development: the selection of a construction management company, the choosing of an operator for the hotel and the signing of tenants for the office space.


China Pressing to Join Trade Club
With its huge internal market and steep growth in exports to the United States, China's effort to become a founding member of a new world trading system could prove to be one of the significant trade events of this time.

Whirling Dervishes Spin a Mystical Link Between Earthly and Divine Love
For the whirling dervishes of Konya, Turkey, ecstasy derives from discipline.
They performed a sema, the Sufi ritual of spiritual rebirth, before a sold-out house on Friday night at the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine.
It was a spectacle: six men dressed in white with tall camel-hair hats, with arms outstretched and long skirts twirling, accompanied by music that slowly gathered momentum, from stately extended melodies to more vigorous, more rhythmic tunes.
The white costumes represent death shrouds; the hats, tombstones.
In the mystical Islam that was taught by Jalal ad-Din Rumi, sometimes known as Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi (1207-1273), the spinning dancers are a link between earthly existence and rapturous divine love.
There was no chaos, no abandon in their ecstasy.
As they whirled, the dervishes proceeded in a circle around the stage, comparable to orbiting planets, while their dancing master strolled among them.
They never lost direction, collided or showed dizziness when they stopped for ceremonial bows.
Yet unlike twirling ballet dancers, they moved their heads along with their bodies.

The Contract's Brutal Arithmetic
Republicans have pledged to vote within 100 days of taking control of the House on a "Contract With America," a package of 10 bills that offers government reforms, tax cuts and deficit reduction.
Newt Gingrich, the likely next Speaker, has vowed to honor the pledge promptly.
Voting on the contract will be easy.
Paying for the package will not.
The social and economic costs could be staggering.

Gay Politicians Cite Gains Amid Losses
Although they lost several major allies and face a far more conservative and hostile Congress, lesbian and gay political leaders say that last week's election was not a repudiation by voters of the gay rights movement.
"People are in mourning, as they well should be," said Sheila James Kuehl, speaking here at a three-day conference sponsored by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and that ended today.
"Yet we defeated two anti-gay initiatives, and 24 lesbian or gay officials were re-elected or newly elected."


Abroad at Home; Eye Of Newt
With victory, would Newt Gingrich move from street fighter to statesman?
It took only a few days to learn the answer: No.
As prospective Speaker of the House, he quickly wrote a letter to the present Speaker, Tom Foley, warning Democrats not to hide or destroy any official documents.
Of course he did not think the famously honorable Mr.
Foley was going to purloin documents.
It was just a way to plant the idea of a Democratic conspiracy: a way to continue his war on the opposition.


U.S. OFFERS CHINA DEAL TO RESOLVE A MISSILE DISPUTE
The United States has offered to forgive China's violations of an international missile accord and waive possible sanctions if China admits the violations, senior Administration officials said today.
If China accepts the offer it would help resolve one of the most difficult issues between the countries.
But the plan would effectively reward China for simply telling the truth about any violations and could encourage other countries to flout the accord.

Exploring the Links Between Depression, Writers and Suicide
When the poet Anne Sexton learned of Sylvia Plath's suicide in 1963, she was horrified.
"That death was mine," she said.
Eleven years later, wrapped in a fur coat that once belonged to her mother, she sat in her car with the engine running in a closed garage and ended her life.
Literary artists have always been drawn to death as a subject, but a disproportionate number of them have also courted it in their personal lives.
In a daylong conference at the 92d Street Y on Friday, several scholars and writers explored the links between depression, creativity and suicide, primarily in the life and work of Sexton, Plath and Ernest Hemingway.

Take Six in Search of a Communal Feeling
Take Six tried so hard to make something special happen at the Beacon Theater on Saturday night that it was hard not to feel some sympathy when nothing came of its work.
The band, a pop-gospel group with supercharged harmonies that borrow from jazz vocal music to doo-wop to quartet gospel music, did its best to create the sort of mood that gets a house rocking, but it failed.
The group tried sing-alongs.
Its leader, Mark Kibble, tried to preach.
With choreography, astoundingly tight vocal arrangements and costumes that looked like something out of a J. Crew catalogue, the singers tried to present a communal image, a band hard at work pleasing its constituency.

The Institute of Human Origins, which usually honors a living scientist at its annual benefit in New York, is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the discovery of Lucy, the skeleton of one of the oldest human forebears.
Though pieces of considerably older hominid fossils have been found since then, Lucy remains the "most complete ancestor we have," DR.

Pataki Plans Major Overhaul To Shift Direction in Albany
Governor-elect George E. Pataki will begin a sweeping overhaul of New York's state government this week, seeking to impose his Republican vision on a sprawling bureaucracy guided by Democratic policies and partisans for the last 20 years.
The effort will start with the appointment of commissioners and directors to run some 40 state agencies.
The first is expected to be a state budget director, who will be faced with a shortfall of as much as $4 billion in the next fiscal year.


METRO DIGEST
A SURE BET TURNS OUT TO BE A LOSER
When New York City went into the bookmaking business in 1971, its officials envisioned that their monopoly franchise would ultimately yield annual profits of $200 million.
As it turns out, their projection was off -- by just a little more than $200 million.
Like race tracks and other off-track betting operations, the Offtrack Betting Corporation has been losing customers to casinos and state lottery games.
But it has its own peculiar set of longstanding problems: unappealing betting parlors, antiquated technology, political patronage, inept management and an inefficient work force.

Essay; Transfer Of Power
Bill Clinton remains President of the United States for foreign affairs, but the center of power in domestic affairs -- both in voting strength and intellectual energy -- has shifted from the White House to the putative Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich.
Our first elected half-term President has only himself, his wife and their political advisers to blame for this unprecedented power division.
When Representative Gingrich sought to nationalize local elections by submitting a platform of clear, conservative promises, Mr.
Clinton foolishly agreed to escalate the mid-term elections into a stark choice between Reaganism and Clintonism.

Now Myanmar Must Choose
Myanmar's ruling junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or Slorc, is one of the world's most brutal, least legitimate regimes.
It seized power in what used to be known as Burma by massacring democracy demonstrators in the streets of Rangoon six years ago.
Since then it has ignored elections, cooperated with drug lords and waged a relentless war against democratic political leaders, university students, Buddhist religious activists and the ethnic minorities who make up more than a third of Myanmar's population.
This grim dictatorship is now being courted by countries eager for new economic opportunities in the world's hottest boom region.
These include many of Myanmar's Southeast Asian neighbors and much of the European Union.
To the east, Thailand makes refugees fleeing the Slorc's repression feel unwelcome.
To the north, China provides military aid, consumer goods and diplomatic support.
The U.S. stands almost alone in principled opposition to the Slorc, denying it anti-narcotics aid and development assistance, blocking loans from international banks and criticizing it in international forums.


Men's Health Magazine Gains Muscle
In 1986, with virtually everyone saying they were crazy to start a health magazine for men, the people at Rodale Press put out 200,000 test copies of a sprightly new magazine called Men's Health.
It quickly went on to become one of the great circulation success stories of recent years.
By 1991, Men's Health was guaranteeing advertisers a circulation of 350,000.
By 1992 the guarantee had risen to half a million, with actual sales exceeding the guarantee by 25 percent.
For the first six months of this year, the magazine's circulation was 1.2 million.

From Stealth Candidate To a Stealth Governor?
NEVER has in-your-face New York, with its history of brawling, demanding politics, seen anything like George E. Pataki's campaign for governor.
He managed to run a stealth candidacy, standing for little other than the death penalty, lower taxes, welfare reform and not being Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo.
And he won.
The question for him and New York now is can he govern, standing for so little?
The Republican Governor-elect might well be asking himself these days, as that stunned Robert Redford character did in "The Candidate," the 1972 film, "What do we do now?"


Knicks Need Offense, Not Another Jump Shot
Instead of analyzing their first loss, the Knicks were more concerned with how they would respond to it.
New York was so thoroughly beaten in Saturday night's 101-82 defeat by the San Antonio Spurs that it made little sense to dwell on the performance.
The Knicks were outplayed from start to finish, with David Robinson (35 points, 13 rebounds) dominating his matchup with Patrick Ewing as well as the game.

SCIENTISTS who helped the Navy create the sophisticated submarine-tracking computer system celebrated in "The Hunt for Red October" now want to deploy similar technology to listen for trouble spots in jet engines, nuclear reactor coolant pumps and electricity-generating steam turbines.
Early detection of hairline cracks, for example, would enable technicians to replace crucial parts long before lives are endangered or there is expensive damage.
"The Navy has used very advanced digital processing on its submarines for decades," said Walter C. Hernandez, vice president for technology at the Monitoring Technology Corporation.
"But this kind of technology is only now being applied to normal civilian machinery."

Market Place; Two views of the future for New Plan Realty Trust.
THESE are not the best of times for real estate investment trusts, known as REIT's.
Many publicly owned companies in this interest-rate-sensitive industry have suffered from this year's advances in interest rates and their prices have been steadily pushed lower.
Although it has been affected by this trend, New Plan Realty Trust, one of the oldest and largest REIT's, is listed by many analysts as a strong candidate for appreciation.
Among the reasons cited are its diversified portfolio, a strong balance sheet with relatively little debt and a record of more than 15 years of dividend increases.

Following in the featured match, second-ranked Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, will go against Julie Halard of France.
Sanchez Vicario, champion of this year's French and United States Opens, has won her last four tournaments and is just 42 ranking points behind top-ranked Steffi Graf.
Because of a painful lower-back condition, the German has not competed since the Open, but she intends to play at the Garden.

Rights Protests Undercut Indonesia's Standing at Asia-Pacific Forum
Disturbances in East Timor today and a two-day-old sit-in at the United States Embassy here have moved Indonesia's human rights record into the spotlight at a meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific region.
President Suharto has been hoping to call attention to Indonesia's economic progress and enhance its international standing as host of the meeting, at which the leaders of 18 nations are expected to issue a declaration setting them on the path toward free trade by the year 2020.
But the presence of world leaders and hundreds of journalists has increased the risk that the Indonesian Government would receive unwanted attention for its suppression of labor movements, its censorship of the press, and its invasion and annexation of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony.


JAZZ
A Composer Whose Music Asks The Audience to Come to It  Miller Theater
Muhal Richard Abrams, the well-respected composer and pianist who moves through the classical, new- music and jazz worlds, rarely finds a middle ground between dry, academic compositions and his sometimes thrilling jazz work.
On Thursday night, in front of a small audience, Mr.
Abrams and his band performed a long piece, "The Prism," which avoided almost completely any of music's roots in functionalism.
There were few melodies, few well-articulated rhythms and long sections where the timbres of a piece, desiccated and harsh, limited its emotional range.


Pre-Death Cash: A Business Grows
Buying life insurance policies from terminally ill people to provide them cash before they die, once seen as a ghoulish business not for the faint of heart, is emerging from the shadows.
As the young industry grows large, insurance companies and big banks are attracted to this obscure corner of the business world previously dominated by free-wheeling brokers and small entrepreneurs operating largely free from scrutiny.
State regulators are paying more attention, to the dismay of some pioneers in the business, but to the approval of the new big corporate interests.


Police Add Law Degrees To Their Badges and Guns

In This Believe It or Not, Santana Is a Champion
After being crowned the new super welterweight champion on Saturday night, Luis Santana of the Dominican Republic was whisked out of the ring on a stretcher.
For the boxing world -- where paragliders intrude on fights and a 45-year-old is the heavyweight champion -- it was just one more hard-to-believe development.
Santana, a 34-year-old Dominican, is not an elite fighter.
But he captured the World Boxing Council and International Boxing Federation titles from Terry Norris, 27, after Norris was disqualified for hitting Santana in the back of the head.


Abortion Clinic Case Revives a Legal Dilemma
In his trial for fatally shooting a doctor and his volunteer escort outside a Pensacola, Fla., abortion clinic, Paul J. Hill waged one last protest: he chose to represent himself, then refused to offer any witnesses or evidence on his own behalf.
In refusing to speak up, Mr.
Hill made it easier for the 12 jurors hearing his case to convict him and to recommend that he die in Florida's electric chair.
In that sense, legal experts say, his case raised disturbing questions.
If the death penalty is imposed, how fair is it to execute someone condemned on half the evidence?
Is the state of Florida simply carrying out the wishes of a defendant who wants to die?


Korea-Japan Tension Is Centuries Old; Oe the Dissenter

When Oe Kenzaburo won the Nobel Prize in Literature, the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun suggested that the choice of an author known for gritty, politically charged portrayals of post-World War II life might be a sign that the West had moved beyond a view of Japan based on Orientalist stereotypes.
Sadly, your Nov. 6 article about Mr.

The Mayor's Wife Ignites a Furor in Yonkers; Lynn Zaleski Arrives on the Public Stage With Ample Fire and Brimstone
The way Lynn Zaleski sees it, the Yonkers city government can be divided into two camps: one captained by her husband, the Mayor, a good man trying to rescue the city from its corrupt past, and the other led by a majority of the City Council, intent on destroying him.
Last July, at a public budget hearing broadcast on cable television here, Mrs.
Zaleski decided to tell the people of the state's fourth-largest city exactly how she felt.
Standing at a lectern in the audience, she unleashed a furious attack on several Council members.
She told them they spoke with "forked tongues," she read to them from the Psalms of David ("they have opened wicked and treacherous mouths against me") and she berated them for "bringing the city to ruin."

Bhagat is believed to be in great danger.

Dividend Meetings


Motor Vehicle Theft
After peaking around 1990, reported motor vehicle thefts in New York City and the region have fallen considerably.
Preliminary 1994 figures show a further decline: car thefts were down 15 percent in the city and 13 percent in New York State in the first six months of 1994 from the first six months of 1993.
Law-enforcement officials credit increased enforcement efforts, the proliferation of alarms and other anti-theft devices, and the growing use of identification numbers on cars and parts as reasons for the drop in auto theft.
Bridgeport and Newark have even higher rates of car theft per 100,000 residents than New York City, though reported theft in each of those cities declined more than 20 percent in 1993 from 1992.


An Indirect Route Brings a Charge In the Death of a Milk Deliveryman
In four decades of delivering milk, butter and eggs to small markets throughout Brooklyn, Gerald Goldberg built his business through connections, talking to customers, gaining people's trust and learning of opportunities.

Fearing a Conspiracy, Some Heed a Call to Arms
On a raw, damp weekend morning near this town at the top of Lake Michigan, some 100 members of a group calling itself the Michigan Militia have convened amid the scrub pine to practice military techniques many long ago forgot.
Although the training is unsophisticated and the breathing ragged for the middle-aged self-styled warriors, the purpose of the assault maneuvers and target practice is deadly serious, they say.
The Michigan Militia is preparing to defend itself against the United States Government.
In the six months since it was formed here in Emmet County, the organization has started chapters, or "brigades," throughout Michigan, said Ray Southwell, the group's information officer.


3 Bands That Help Redefine the Conventions of Their Form
Short, fast, loud and catchy: the basics of pop-rock haven't changed in decades, but they are constantly being reaccessorized.
For the 1990's, the popular trappings include a buffer of guitars -- often distorted or discordant -- and lyrics that fracture or ignore the romantic verities of older pop.
Mere melody can seem too sweet, not tough enough; fierce guitars and booming drums eliminate any wimpiness.
On Saturday night at Roseland, Sugar, Velocity Girl and Magnapop were a triple bill of kindred bands, shielding tender feelings in muscular, noisy rock, skipping lead-guitar solos to get to the next riff or accusation.
Bob Mould, who leads Sugar, helped invent the style with Husker Du in the 1980's.
After an interlude as a solo performer, using gentler arrangements, he returned to the power-trio lineup with Sugar.
The set was a pleasurable post-punk barrage: one three-minute song leading immediately to the next, with breaks only for tuning every half a dozen songs.

New Kid on Block Bumps Shoulders With an Idol
When Reggie White recorded 21 sacks during the 1987 season -- a number that still stands as a National Football Conference record -- James Brown was a two-way lineman for the football team at Philadelphia's Mastbaum High School, a teen-ager who watched White and the Eagles religiously.
And though Brown dreamed that he, too, would play in the National Football League someday, it must have been hard for him to imagine what he faced this afternoon at Lambeau Field.
Lining up at right tackle for the Jets for what was his fourth career start, Brown found himself face to face with White in what was a crucial game for both the Packers and the Jets.

Albert Symphony Has a Posthumous Premiere
At his death in an auto accident in 1992, the composer Stephen Albert was working on a theory of what he called harmonic fields in music.
Presumably the idea was that much music that did not literally use traditional tonal harmony created its tensions and resolutions with large, vaguer areas of harmonic force.
Albert may have written his Second Symphony as an example.
It was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic and received its premiere during the weekend's series of subscription concerts conducted by Hugh Wolff.
Albert completed a short score before his death, indicating about half the instrumentation; a colleague, Sebastian Currier, felt very little else was required and orchestrated the piece based on his knowledge of Albert's style.
Much of Albert's previous music was inspired by literary texts, including his Pulitzer Prize-winning "Riverrun" (1984).
The Second Symphony, though, is a piece of absolute, abstract music.
Its three movements last about a half-hour, during which there are identifiable key regions.
The third -- a familiar interval in tonal music -- gives the work much of its coloration.
There are even, here and there, tonal melodies that echo late Romanticism.
The work is full of allusions to earlier styles, including both Mahler (in the sarcastic-sounding second movement) and Copland (in the elegiac passages of the last).
The label neo-Romantic was often applied to Albert; this piece deserves to be called his Neo-Romantic Symphony.

One out of six people here is of Ukrainian descent.
Even though the community goes back more than 100 years to the first waves of agricultural immigration to help populate the prairies, Ukrainian identity still thrives through newspapers, magazines, schools, churches, clubs, choruses, dance groups and professional associations.
There are even credit unions that preserve a Ukrainian identity.

As Iraqis Scrimp, Their President Lives Lavishly, U.S. Says
American officials trying to maintain support for economic sanctions against Iraq said today that since the end of the Persian Gulf war, Saddam Hussein has spent what may be as much as $1 billion on palaces and presidential retreats around the country.
At a time when many Iraqis are destitute, Iraq has not only repaired the damage allied bombings did to Government palaces during the 1991 war, but is also expanding them and building new ones, according to American intelligence reports.

Of Rankings, Survival And the Quack Attack
This was not a weekend to discover a sharper focus in this passionate college football season.
This was a weekend to appreciate resourcefulness.
Even as teams began to clinch bowl positions, or come within a step of championships, the questions persist.
On Survival Saturday, all anyone wanted to do was minimize the damage and get to the next week.
"I know what kind of team this is," said Bobby Engram, the Penn State receiver who became an essential part of the 96-yard, game-winning drive that allowed the Nittany Lions to clinch a Rose Bowl spot with a 35-31 victory here against Illinois.
Penn State's ability to win despite a 21-point first quarter deficit, the largest overcome in a victory during Joe Paterno's 29 seasons as coach, was one of several difficult escapes that allowed highly ranked teams to remain significant factors.


In Europe, the Right Also Rises
Jorg Haider, an athletic-looking and charismatic 44-year-old, is the new European right personified, one of the rising conservative populists who may be the wave of the future or a troubling throwback to the fascist past.

All year long everyone has suspected that the San Diego Chargers had a guardian angel sitting on their shoulder pads.
Now, they know for sure.
It was certified here on a rainy afternoon at Arrowhead Stadium, where the Chargers had not won a game since 1989.
San Diego managed a 14-13 victory in a game where the Chargers committed three first-half turnovers, trailed by 13-0 at the half, couldn't muster a decent passing or rushing attack, and witnessed Joe Montana, the master of the last-minute comeback, run out of time at the San Diego 30.

Mexican Chief Urges Talks on Freer Flow of Migrants
With Mexican anger still building over the approval of a California ballot initiative to cut social services to undocumented immigrants, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has said Mexico and the United States will have to discuss a freer flow of migrant workers just as they negotiate free trade.
Little more than two weeks before his six-year term is to end, Mr.
Salinas argued that some sort of bilateral agreement on a greater legal flow of Mexican migrant workers northward is the only way that the problem might be controlled.


Far-Flung Jam Session: Medium Is the Massage
The distance between the maker of music and the music itself has always existed.
It takes a certain amount of traveling for a finger, a foot or a set of lungs to produce a sound.
Pianos have complicated levers that must be negotiated one by one; air must pass through tubes and valves to give a trumpet life.
So the Electronic Cafe International at the Kitchen late Saturday night was nothing new; it simply upped the distance ante by many times.
In this three-city hook-up along the information highway, the Kitchen on West 19th Street, the Electronic Cafe in Santa Monica, Calif., and Studio X in Santa Fe, N.M., created sight and sound that whipped back and forth across this country's various rocks, rills and purple majesties.

Physicists Strive To Create Atoms Of Antihydrogen From Antimatter
ANTIMATTER: the super fuel for driving spacecraft to the stars, the wonder annihilator that could make hydrogen bombs seem like firecrackers, the antistuff of antigalaxies inhabited by antipeople . . ..
In the 66 years since the British physicist Paul A. M. Dirac theorized the existence of antimatter, the wilder notions about this fascinating but elusive substance have remained closer to fiction than to physics.
Nevertheless, the creation of antimatter in high-energy laboratories has become routine, bringing exciting new possibilities within reach.


POP
A Mingling of the Arts By 2 Groups From Mexico  Hostos Community College
"We wanted to play an uncompromising, challenging kind of music that would make people think and criticize and become dissatisfied with what we thought were the hollow products of the music industry," Chris Cutler wrote about his progressive rock band Henry Cow in the 1984 book "File Under Popular." Although Mr.
Cutler's polemics have become dated, his intentions were noble.
This was the case when two groups from Mexico City, Banda Elastica, an avant-garde fusion band, and Asalto Diario, which brings together dance, theater and acrobatics, performed on Friday night.
Like Mr.
Cutler, the two groups cut their own path through the arts, mix their media and, of course, write manifestoes.


Woman Says Jar Contained Crack
Federal food and drug officials and the police yesterday were investigating a report by a Washington Heights woman who said she found 32 vials of crack cocaine in a sealed jar of Hellmann's mayonnaise bought at a local supermarket on Sunday.
No product recall was ordered, and there were no indications that other jars were tainted.
By last night, after questioning the woman and examining the plant where the mayonnaise was packed and the store where it was sold, officials were unable to say if they were dealing with a product safety issue, or with a strange but isolated case.


POP
Many Voices in Harmony, Or a Musical Babel?  S.O.B.'s
Imagine watching a movie in which the director is on screen ordering the actors around.
That was the feeling when watching a mixed bag of musicians perform music by Kip Hanrahan during the first of two sets on Sunday night.
Beer bottle in hand, Mr.
Hanrahan threaded his way through his large ensemble all evening, whispering advice to the bassist and vocalist Fernando Saunders as he tried to sing, and muddling the violinist Billy Bang with instructions for a solo.
Mr.
Hanrahan wasn't conducting; he was producing, overseeing and rearranging.
Most of the time he succeeded in greasing the wheels of his performing machine.

25 Minutes of Terror in San Francisco
About eight days ago, a 37-year-old drifter named Victor Boutwell told a relative, "You're gonna be surprised at what I'm going to do." The relative thought Mr.
Boutwell was contemplating suicide.
Instead, he surfaced on Sunday with a small arsenal of weapons, spraying semiautomatic gunfire for 25 terrifying minutes at passers-by and the police on the fringes of the wealthy Pacific Heights section of San Francisco.
Ten officers returned his fire, and one of them, 38-year-old James Guelff, was fatally shot before Mr.
Boutwell, a man who spent the last six years living out of the back of his van, was himself shot to death.

Political Depression Hits Brunch Belt
What did you think of the election?
Like Dorothy on the Yellow Brick Road, New Yorkers on the Upper West Side of Manhattan responded to the question posed to them on the sidewalk by figuratively tapping their heels together and whispering, there's no place like home.
The Upper West Side is the heart of liberal New York, which makes it the heart of the heart of liberal America, a kind of urban college town, the East Coast version of Berkeley, Calif., or Madison, Wis.
True to form, a week ago, Assembly Districts 67 and 69, which more or less define the area, not only returned their Democratic incumbents, Scott M. Stringer and Edward C. Sullivan, to the State Assembly with some 80 percent of the vote, but they voted for Gov.

Health Care and Hospital Chains; Small Institutions Choose Survival Over Independence
For 40 years, the volunteers of the women's auxiliary of the Schoharie County Memorial Hospital ran the hospital coffee shop.
They divided themselves into 30 chapters named for gemstones -- Sapphire for the Methodist Church women, Crystal for teachers, Diamond for the wives of doctors and lawyers.
Together, they kept the restaurant open six days a week, ran bake sales and antique shows in their spare time and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to support the town's 70-bed pride and joy.
"I made an awful lot of egg salad sandwiches in my day," said Vesta Hauser, a Sapphire and at one point the Auxiliary's president.


Rising Dollar Helps Dow Post Gain of 28.26
One day ahead of an important meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers, the stock market rallied yesterday, buoyed by a rising dollar that also lifted bond prices.
But the factors supporting the dollar, like the vote in Sweden to join the European Union, may be short term and thus stock and bond prices could fall later in the week, analysts say.

To Remember Seed Caches, Bird Grows New Brain Cells
EVERY fall, when the trees of North America's forests shake themselves into bare brown bones, and the sky grows gray and surly, and the meadows offer little but brambles and shriveled berries, the little black-capped chickadee rises brilliantly to the challenges of a callous world.
The insects it has feasted on throughout the spring and summer are all dead, which means the bird must start foraging over a much wider terrain for fast-vanishing seeds and nuts.
And, it must join forces with huge flocks of other hungry chickadees, far more birds than it had to tolerate during the balmy breeding season.


Earthquakes as Just a Fact of Life

Seven years after its completion, the playground is a wreck.
Rubber swings were shredded by pit bulls being trained by neighborhood boys.
Metal swings and slides were stolen.
A spiraling plastic slide, the only remaining piece of play equipment, has a big hunk ripped out.
There is broken glass, swirling graffiti, crack vials and, these days, few children.

Flood of Rwanda Refugees Is Destroying Ecological Treasure
AT first light, the lines of humanity are already snaking across the fields of tall grass and stumps, heading into the forests of Virunga National Park.
Throughout the day people straggle back out, their bounty balanced on their heads -- here a child with a bundle of sticks, there a man with a thick log, women struggling under remarkably heavy loads.
They are refugees, among the nearly one million who fled into this part of Zaire last summer to escape the civil war in Rwanda.
In spite of regulations adopted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that camps should be situated away from national parks and forests, more than 90 percent of the refugees live within walking distance of the park.
And every day an estimated 30,000 adults and children forage in the park with their machetes, emerging with loads averaging 40 pounds, said Craig Sanders, an environmental consultant here for the refugee agency.

Re "Where Soviets Strutted, Capitalism Sets Up Shop" (Moscow Journal, Nov. 8):


Laying Odds on America's Soul
The most colorful character in Sam Shepard's elegiac new play "Simpatico" is a former bigwig in the California horse-racing world who has been forced through scandal to relocate and start life over under an assumed name.
The man, once known as Simms (James Gammon), now calls himself Ames and holds down a low-echelon job with the Kentucky Racing Commission.
A gruff, raspy-voiced throwback to 1940's detective movies, he works in a grimy office whose most distinguishing feature is a leather chair decorated with the horns of a steer.
Visited by Vinnie (Fred Ward), a self-styled private eye who helped arrange his downfall 15 years earlier, Simms seems hardly to remember his previous life or the man who disgraced him.
Waxing nostalgic, Simms laments the disappearance of movies like "Double Indemnity" and "The Maltese Falcon" because, he says, they were "pictures with a plot you could sink your teeth into."

For Musical Appreciation, Sexes Go Their Own Ways
Look around most concert halls during any evening or matinee performance, and you might notice more women than men listening for the strains of Mozart or Rachmaninoff.
But after the curtain falls and the lights go up, saunter over to the classical section of the nearest record store to see the flip side of this gender-tuned natural selection.
There you will more likely find men thumbing through the current batch of music magazines or buying yet another version of the Bach B-minor Mass.
While the appeal of classical music is hardly limited to one sex, an unofficial roundup of research by record companies, poll-takers, concert halls and academics suggests that men and women seem to enjoy their music in very different ways.
Among those who call themselves lovers of classical music, women are more likely to attend live performances, while men outnumber women when it comes to buying music.

The cash market, which was closed on Friday in observance of Veterans Day, opened for trading yesterday and immediately followed the downward pattern of the futures market on Friday.
But as the dollar turned higher against other foreign currencies, particularly the German mark and Japanese yen, bond prices began to make some solid gains.

Clinton Promotes U.S.-North Korea Nuclear Agreement
In wide-ranging meetings with Asian and Pacific leaders, President Clinton sought on Monday to promote support for Washington's nuclear accord with North Korea and train the spotlight on America's more prominent role in the Asia-Pacific region.
But senior Administration officials acknowledged that the United States faces extraordinarily complicated negotiations with Japan, South Korea and other participants in carrying out the nuclear accord during the next decade, and even Mr.
Clinton said that making it a reality would be difficult.


A Disillusioned State Gives Up on Democrats
Sometimes it is the little things that lead to big changes.

The 47-year-old former Soviet champion, who lives in Fair Lawn, N.J., won with captivating combinations, trenchant tactics, precise positional play and excellently executed endgames.
And when, in a rare case, he got himself into a dangerous situation, he cleverly crawled away unscathed.
It's no wonder that he was the only undefeated player and won with a lead of 1 1/2 points over the star-studded field.


Clinton Defends Halting Arms Embargo Enforcement
President Clinton today offered his first public defense of his decision to order the American military to stop enforcing the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government, a step that has alarmed American allies.
Mr.

He insisted that the move did not represent a violation of the international embargo, but acknowledged that the top deputies who have accompanied him to Asia have had to devote considerable time to a campaign to soothe European tempers.


Dwindling Salmon Spur West to Save Rivers
HOOK-JAWED, wild and still magnificent after its taxing and hazardous struggle up the Rogue River from the ocean 125 miles away, the big coho salmon was beginning to don his scarlet mating colors, just as his kind has done every November for thousands upon thousands of years.
But far fewer fish than made the trip just a few years ago are being recorded these days by the video camera trained constantly on a narrow underwater passage through which all migrating salmon must pass to get around Gold Ray Dam.
Lately, annual runs of wild coho on the Rogue as they head for their natal waters on tributaries upstream have been about 80 percent below average.
Federal officials are expected to announce soon whether they will declare the coho an endangered species throughout much of the Pacific Northwest.
Fisheries biologists say, in fact, that most strains of Pacific salmon -- as valued a totem in this region as the bald eagle is in the nation at large -- are in deep trouble as a result of overfishing at sea, natural climatic factors and destruction of freshwater habitat where the big fish spawn and where their progeny grow large enough to return to the ocean.

Despite gains against the Serbs by the Bosnian Government, the war in Bosnia and Croatia is largely over at this point.
Although the Serbs didn't get all the lands they wanted, they won the war.
They got more territory than the Croats or Bosnians and killed more people (if those are criteria for victory).


EXPANSION OF A BRITISH INTERACTIVE TV TRIAL IS PLANNED
The Oracle Corporation and BT, formerly British Telecommunications P.L.C., plan to expand their British interactive television services trial to 2,500 homes in the middle of 1995.

How Ever Did You Do It, Mr. Ives?
Of Charles Ives, the greatest and strangest of American composers, so much is still unknown.
There are basic, unresolved questions about the editing of his manuscripts, the chronology of his output, the validity of his recollections.
And a more essential mystery shrouds his process of creation.
At an Ives-centered festival presented by the Brooklyn Philharmonic last weekend, a member of the audience asked, "How did you do it?" The question was directed at the composer John Adams, who had orchestrated several Ives songs, but one wanted to ask it of Ives himself.
How, from a chaos of secondhand material, does great music arise?
The weekend's events at the Brooklyn Academy of Music offered many fascinating insights into Ives, although it also created some new confusions.
The theme was "American Transcendentalists," tracing the powerful connection between Ives and the school of 19th-century idealist philosophy centered in Concord, Mass.
There was a rich spread of Ives works: "Three Places in New England," "The Unanswered Question," various songs and shorter pieces and, naturally, the "Concord" Sonata.
In and among them, the actor Donald Moffat read aloud selections from Emerson and Thoreau.

Tenacity Solves an Ugly Bankruptcy
When people talk about Integrated Resources, the nationwide real estate syndication firm that filed for bankruptcy almost five years ago, only a few observations will not draw a big argument.
One is that the company has gone through one of the ugliest bankruptcy cases they have ever experienced.
Integrated Resources owed its existence almost entirely to the sales prowess of Drexel Burnham Lambert's junk-bond star, Michael Milken.
When both Drexel and Integrated collapsed on the same day in February 1990, Integrated's infuriated creditors included some of the nation's biggest banks, whose lawyers were soon presiding over a Gordian knot of litigation.

But civil-rights organizations, including the N.A.A.C.P., said that it merely preserved the status quo.


Sports of The Times; Beard Gets A Lesson In the Nets
ONE night last week in Landover, Md., one Alfred (Butch) Beard blew his top, which was unusual only in that Mr.
Beard is a man of normally gentle mien.
The circumstances make a point that goes to the heart of the matter.
Mr.
Beard, of course, is the rookie coach of what for want of a better term is called a basketball team.
It is the New Jersey Nets basketball team, which explains why even someone like Mr.
Beard might find occasion to go bananas.
The Nets had lost handily to the Bullets -- they now have lost five of their first six games -- but they had lost in a fashion that Mr.
Beard found odious.

Credibility of Carjacking Witness Is Debated
Lawyers for a Bronx premedical student accused of murder in a carjacking in January tried today to support his account that the murder was committed by a drug dealer named Dino.
They called two witnesses who said they saw a tall, nattily dressed man on the day of the crime who could have been the shadowy figure.
But the credibility of the more crucial of those witnesses, Michael Clausell of South Ozone Park, Queens, was attacked by the prosecutor during cross-examination.
The prosecutor showed that while Mr.
Clausell could precisely remember a mundane scene at a mall -- a tall black man getting out of a Lexus and greeting two white teen-agers standing next to a Jeep -- he could not remember the name of his last employer, the jobs he had held for years at a time, or that he had twice pleaded guilty to charges of selling drugs.

The Mess at Youth Services
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has created a special task force to examine allegations of mismanagement at New York City's Department of Youth Services.
It will incorporate an investigation already started by the city's Department of Investigation.
A separate City Council investigation also continues.
These probes are aimed at determining what went wrong at the agency, which has been in disarray for months, and how it can be fixed.
The agency's $72.6 million budget covers grants to about 800 nonprofit groups that provide after-school, counseling and job training programs to youths.
In an effort to give some newer organizations a chance, the Dinkins administration last year deliberately tried to de-emphasize experience as a criteria for awarding contracts.
The Giuliani administration went further and virtually eliminated experience as a factor.
When new contracts were announced for the new budget year, 140 veteran youth-service groups abruptly lost city funding.
They were replaced by 99 new groups, most with no track record.

As part of the overall goal of "free and open trade" in one of the fastest growing economic regions in the world, the officials said, the United States, Japan and other developed nations are expected to accept an earlier goal for ending their trade barriers, probably by 2010.

Making China Trade Fairly
China desperately wants to qualify as a founding member of the World Trade Organization.
President Clinton obstinately stands in the way -- which is exactly where he belongs.
The W.T.O., according to the trade accord signed by more than 100 countries in April, will be created early next year to oversee international trade.
Membership would solidify China's emerging presence in international markets and guarantee that countries would not discriminate against its exports.
The United States agrees that China -- which is among the world's 10 largest exporters -- belongs in the World Trade Organization.
But the Clinton Administration rightly insists that China agree to adopt the same rules of fair trade that apply to other large countries in the W.T.O.

Role Shifts For Central Bankers
For the world's central bankers, the stage these days may be smaller, but their role has become bigger.
In the 1980's, when Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Karl Otto Pohl of the Bundesbank in Germany stepped onto the world stage, central bankers starred in the drive to curb global inflation, sharing top billing with the finance ministers of the seven largest industrial nations in moving currency rates up and down to cope with trade imbalances.

Was There or Wasn't There a Pneumonic Plague Epidemic?
In September, Indian Government officials set off an international public health emergency by reporting an epidemic of pneumonic plague, the most dangerous form of plague, which is spread by coughing.
Indians panicked and fled the areas where the disease had been reported.
Tourists canceled trips to India and other countries imposed surveillance checks of passengers arriving at many airports from India and banned imports of goods from India.
Now, despite reports that a World Health Organization team has found that plague did strike in two cities, Indian experts in infectious diseases maintain that the epidemic was not plague, but was due to some other as yet unidentified agent.
Their contention is based largely on two points: that the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, was never isolated from any case and that the types of laboratory tests used in India are not definitive.

However, Indonesia's image has been marred by the perennially embarrassing issue of East Timor, the former Portuguese colony it invaded in 1975 and forcibly annexed.
Anticipating world attention on the summit, 29 East Timorese students entered the U.S.

In a three-page opinion released late this afternoon, Judge Lance A. Ito of Los Angeles Superior Court said there "exists no concrete evidence of tampering" of Mr.
Simpson's Ford Bronco.
Defense lawyers had argued that evidence obtained from the Bronco should be excluded because the vehicle was burglarized while it was in police custody at a private tow yard.

REPUBLICANS PLAN AMBITIOUS AGENDA IN NEXT CONGRESS
As it rolled out its "new order" for Congress and the nation, the incoming House Republican leadership announced today that it would force Congress to work 20 hours a day, seven days a week, if necessary, to push through Newt Gingrich's "Contract With America" in 100 days.
The Republicans also pledged to hold hearings around the country on a constitutional amendment that would reintroduce prayers in public schools, which was not part of the contract, and vote on the matter by the 4th of July.
Hearings also will be held on the Federal budget so that citizens can tell lawmakers what the Government's spending priorities should be.


COLLEGE SOCCER REPORT
N.C.A.A. Tournament
The National Collegiate Athletic Association awarded berths yesterday to 32 teams for the Division I tournament, which will start on campuses this week and conclude with the final four Dec. 9-11 at Davidson College in Davidson, N.C.
In keeping with tradition, the N.C.A.A. divided the country into eight regions for the tournament.
But it reduced the minimum number of teams in each region from two to one to make room for more at-large berths.
Virginia (17-3-1) is in quest of its fourth consecutive national title and it appears that the Cavaliers are playing their best right now.
Seeded second in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament that was staged over three days at Clemson, the Cavaliers captured the tournament with victories over Wake Forest, Duke and Clemson.
North Carolina-Greensboro (17-4-0) will be Virginia's opponent in the first round, which also includes four other teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference, proof that the conference is the strongest in the country.
North Carolina State (13-6-0), Duke (14-6-1), North Carolina (13-6-0) and Maryland (13-5-1) are also in the tournament, whose first round must be completed by Sunday.
St.
John's (14-4-3) earned the automatic bid that goes to the winner of the Big East tournament by capturing the tournament for the third consecutive year.
This time, the Red Storm did it with a 1-0 triumph over Georgetown on a goal by Huey Ferguson with just under five minutes left.
Georgetown (18-3-0) was the regular-season winner in the Big East for the first time and was awarded its first tournament bid.
The Hoyas were the most improved team in the league.
"The league is getting stronger every year," said Dave Masur, the coach at St.
John's, who took over the Red Storm three years ago and made it into a powerhouse.
"We've had 5 teams ranked in the top 20 in the country."
While St.
John's will visit Rutgers, Georgetown will play Maryland.
Georgetown was ranked 9th and St.
John's 10th in the coaches' final regular-season poll, which has the first nine positions unchanged from the previous week.
Rutgers (11-4-3) is in the tournament as a result of winning the Atlantic 10 and then beating Loyola (Md.), the winner of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference.
Boston University (18-0-1) finished atop the coaches' national ranking for the end of the regular season as the only undefeated team in the country.
The Terriers ended the regular season with a 3-2 triumph over New Hampshire and will meet Harvard.
Harvard (5-8-2) is in the tournament because of the automatic bid that goes to the winner of the Ivy League, where Brown finished with an overall record of 11-3-1.
The victory over Hartwick earned Brown a bid, and the Bears will play host to New Hampshire (15-4-2) in the first round.
Indiana (19-2-0) was seeded first in the tournament and will play host to Notre Dame (12-9-2).
Indiana took the Big Ten tournament with victories over Wisconsin and Penn State, who both made the tournament.
Wisconsin (14-5-0) will play at Southern Methodist (14-3-1), while Penn State (15-5-1) will meet Robert Morris (15-6-1) in a rematch from last year.
San Francisco (9-6-3) is in the tournament for the 26th time thanks to the automatic bid that goes to the winner of the West Coast Conference.
The Dons, who have captured the national title four times, the last time in 1980, appeared to be out of it this season, after winning only twice in their first eight games, but they have lost only once in their last 10 games.
San Francisco will play Fresno State (17-2-1), while San Diego (13-5-0) will be at Fullerton State (12-6-2) in another West Coast match.
In other matches around the country, St.
Louis (16-5-0) will play Creighton (14-4-1), Alabama-Birmingham (15-3-1) will play U.C.L.A. (15-4-0) and North Carolina-Charlotte (16-3-0) will play host to Charleston (17-6-0).
Women's Division I
North Carolina is a step closer to its 12th overall title , and ninth consecutive N.C.A.A. national title.
The Tar Heels reached the semifinals again with a 3-1 victory over Duke, the team that ended their undefeated streak at 101 games last month.
Connecticut (19-3-0) will provide the opposition for the Tar Heels (23-1-1) in the semifinals, which will be staged Friday at the University of Portland (Ore.).
The Huskies reached the final four with tournament victories over Brown and Hartford.
Notre Dame (21-0-1), the only undefeated team in the country, will play Portland (16-5-0) in the other semifinal to decide Sunday's finalists for the championship.
Notre Dame reached the final four for the first time in its history with victories over George Mason and William and Mary, while Portland advanced by eliminating St.
Mary's and Stanford.

DANCE
Seven Solos of Simplicity Presented by a Wanderer  New York Conservatory of Dance
There was an enjoyably homemade quality to a program of solos presented on Saturday night by Aki Sato, a Japanese-born dancer, choreographer and director.
None of the accompaniment was credited in the program, and a listing of what seemed to be solo titles looked like an afterthought.


Graham May Go Back to Bench; Miller May Go
When teams win, there are few changes.
Coaches don't tamper with the chemistry of a winner.
Losing is different.
To losing teams, changes are almost a part of daily life.
And right now, the 3-7 Giants are on a seven-game losing streak.
That's why there could be two drastic changes, one immediately and the other soon.
The first possibility is quarterback Dave Brown being reinserted as the starter for Monday night's game against the Houston Oilers after sitting on the bench for just one week.


In Russia, Corruption Inflates the Cost of Dying
The Russian way of death would make anyone want to live forever.
Burials, once one of the many subsidies doled out by the worker's state, have become so costly and so thoroughly dependent on graft, bribery and connections that few people can contemplate finding quiet plots of land or buying headstones.


Decking the Screen With Lots of Savers
DEAR Santa,
For Christmas I would like a 21-inch SVGA monitor and a one-gigabyte hard disk drive in a Pentium with 32 megs of RAM.
If you can't handle that, here are a few other ideas.


Hindsight Offers Little Safety
After the Giants lost to the Arizona Cardinals, Coach Dan Reeves was in the shower thinking the game over.
As coaches do, Reeves pondered what might have been.
And the thing that continued to stick in his gut today was not a call he made, but one he didn't make.
Leading by 9-3 late in the fourth quarter, the Giants ended up punting on their second-to-last possession.
They kicked from the 6 and the Cardinals took over at their 46.
They went on to score and win the game, 10-6.


Bosnia Army Retreating in North As Serbs Press Attack, U.N. Says
Nationalist Serbs have forced Bosnian Government fighters to withdraw from about 60 percent of the territory they recaptured two weeks ago near Bihac, in the northwest, United Nations officials here said today.
As of this morning, the Serbs had neared Jankov Vrh, a hilltop about six miles east of Bihac town and about three miles from the edge of the United Nations-designated "safe area," said a United Nations military spokesman, Maj.
Koos Sol.


U.N. Council Decides to Keep Economic Sanctions on Iraq
The Security Council maintained its economic sanctions against Iraq today after the United States provided evidence that President Saddam Hussein was spending lavishly on his own comforts while millions of Iraqis lacked food and medicine.
The United States representative, Madeleine K. Albright, told the Council that while "living standards for most Iraqis have fallen," the Iraqi leader has spent more than $500 million on "dozens of opulent new palaces for the exclusive use of his family."


Hatch Falls From Plane On Takeoff
A cockpit emergency hatch flew off of an American Eagle commuter plane yesterday, seconds after takeoff from Kennedy International Airport, injuring no one but frightening 13 passengers and three crew members.
The aircraft, a twin-engine turboprop with 36 seats, was bound for Albany when it took off at 9:02 A.M. from runway 4-left at Kennedy.
When the hatch fell to the ground, the plane immediately landed on a parallel runway, said Peter Yerkes, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport.


Giuliani Joins Give-and-Take Among Regions
With upstate residents saying they voted against New York City in last week's gubernatorial election, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the city yesterday and the perception that it is a drain on state tax dollars.
"New York City and this region of the state of New York contributes $3.3 billion to Albany that it does not receive back," Mr.
Giuliani said in a speech to the Broadway Association, a civic group of business and real estate executives.

Prudential Places Account in Review
The Prudential Insurance Company of America said yesterday that it had placed in review its estimated $50 million account, which has been handled by Lowe &amp; Partners/SMS in New York for almost five years.
"We really decided to look at our underlying strategy and positioning and really open it up to creative options across the board," said Mary Lou Sack, advertising director at Prudential in Newark, confirming a report of the review this week in Adweek.
A decision is expected by the end of January or early February, she said.

Lyle Lovett, From Wistful to Weird
Lyle Lovett can make any song sound like a small tragedy.
His pained, honeyed voice, with its bluesy turns and its countryish ache, fills every line with sincerity; his unhurried, deadpan delivery gives every line the air of an intimate confession.
He uses his Large Band, including horns, strings and backup singers, to add small touches of down-home Americana like gospel harmonies or a Western-swing fiddle solo; it's a virtuosic group that always defers to its leader.
While Mr.
Lovett always comes across as sympathetic and convincing, his songs leave it up to listeners to decide what's really going on.
Sometimes his narrators are genuinely affectionate or heartbroken; sometimes they're the weirdos who appear in "Creeps Like Me."
At Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday night, in the first of two shows, Mr.
Lovett played a generous, leisurely concert, 2 hours and 40 minutes long.
For its first part, he lavished attention on songs that weren't always worth it: material from his latest, and least, album, "I Love Everybody" (Curb/MCA).
Mr.
Lovett is at the highest plateau of his career so far, after building a dedicated following and then extending his name recognition by marrying the actress Julia Roberts.
But to make "I Love Everybody," he dipped into his archive of early songs, and many of them are juvenalia: clever and trivial, built on one-liners ("Penguins are so sensitive to my needs") or easy ironies.
"Fat Babies," Mr.
Lovett explained, was written to embarrass anyone who sang along; the audience enthusiastically joined in.


Cheeks Considers Return as Player
The assistant coach MAURICE CHEEKS practiced as a player yesterday with the Philadelphia 76ers and said he might try to resume his National Basketball Association career.
"I don't really know what I want to do," said Cheeks, 38, who last played with the New Jersey Nets in 1992-93.
"I didn't come back to play, I came back as a coach. I played in the N.B.A. a long time, and I always enjoyed coming back to the Spectrum.

P.T.A. President Accused of Sexual Abuse
The president of a P.T.A. at an elementary school in Brooklyn was forced to resign five months after four girls accused him of molesting them in the school auditorium, officials said yesterday.
The former president, Gary Session, 30, was forced out last month by parents at Public School 249 in Flatbush, who had only just learned of the accusations, said Harold Wilson, the school's principal.
By the time Mr.
Session resigned, he had been arrested in another incident, after a 7-year-old accused him of molesting her at his home, said a spokeswoman for Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney.


Looking Back: All the Bustle Over Retro
People who enjoy the luxury of not being designers are the first to cry foul when retro arises on a runway.
But the common view in fashion that there exists some amorphous "modern" idea of dress may be, in itself, a myth.
When three of the most inventive designers of this decade -- Vivienne Westwood, John Galliano and Jean-Paul Gaultier -- looked back this season, they did more than offer historians in the field the opportunity to compare three distinguished artists' views of the same subject (consider it fashion's equivalent of Marilyn Monroe's being interpreted by Andy Warhol, James Rosenquist and Keith Haring).
They also signaled a time to make a fresh appraisal of retro, often interpreted as being a sign of a poverty of ideas.


Observer; The Final Analysis
The most interesting explanation of the famous Republican triumph comes from my wife, who is not political and whose mind, therefore, has not been ossified by total immersion in polling statistics.
She thinks it was the inevitable result in a nation with a really heavy channel-surfing habit.
Voters treated the familiar old Democrats just as they treat the familiar old TV shows when they plop down in the parlor with a remote-control gadget.

25 Films Added to National Registry
The Library of Congress added 25 films to the National Film Registry yesterday, including "The Manchurian Candidate," the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and the Zapruder film of the John F. Kennedy assassination.
The additions to the registry were announced by James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York during a meeting of the National Film Preservation Board.
The board advises the librarian of Congress on the selection of films for the registry and on national film preservation policy.


Seton Hall Edges Rutgers as Women's N.I.T. Kicks Off
The college basketball season opened tonight with the first round of the National Invitation Tournament.
No, this is not the N.I.T. that took the men's game from musty prairie field houses to the big-city gloss and evils of Madison Square Garden.
Instead, it is a new 16-team, privately owned preseason tournament for women, sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association.


CHRONICLE
ARTHUR LEVINE, who will be inaugurated as the ninth president of Teachers College at Columbia University tomorrow, took a field trip yesterday to his old elementary school, P.S. 79, at 180th Street and Creston Avenue in the South Bronx.
Dr.
Levine, 46, graduated from the sixth grade at the school in 1960.
"I had grown in up in a time and world in which the American dream was guaranteed to all the kids," he said yesterday after his visit.
"The real estate there is the same, the building is the same, but the kids no longer see education as a way out. The American dream has died. My old school is facing all the obstacles an educational institution can face."


Angolan Foes Sign a Truce in Step Toward a Formal Peace
Leaders of the rival armies that have mauled Angola for 19 years signed a truce tonight, promising that in 24 hours they would stop fighting the last war in southern Africa.
If it holds, the truce will open the way for a formal peace treaty that will disband the Unita rebel army, begin integrating the insurgents into the Government and a unified military, and set in motion United Nations cease-fire monitors.

Fantasies and a Love That Led to Murder
"Next time I write in this diary, Mother will be dead," wrote Pauline Parker, a 15-year-old living in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1954.
"How odd -- yet how pleasing." Making good on that promise, Pauline and her school friend Juliet Hulme went on an outing with Honora Parker, Pauline's mother, and bludgeoned her to death with a brick stuffed in a stocking.
Just before this fateful stroll in the woods, the threesome had stopped to enjoy tea.
Like Leopold and Loeb, their American counterparts, Pauline and Juliet scandalized their countrymen in ways that have not yet been forgotten.
They were smugly superior; they were caught in the grip of illicit passion; they were capable of murdering an innocent relative for no good reason.
On top of this, they broke more serious taboos.
They were genteel schoolgirls who fell in love with each other and, goaded by that love, committed a terminally unladylike crime.


Leader Says Austria Must Face Nazi Past
President Thomas Klestil of Austria, going where none of his predecessors had ever been, went before the Israeli Parliament today to say that his country had often failed to face its past and that it produced "many of the worst henchmen in the Nazi dictatorship."
Mr.
Klestil's remarks fell short of an explicit Austrian apology for the Nazis' mass killing of Jews, though Israelis had been told they could expect an apology.


Pollsters Say Health Care Helped Sweep Away Democrats
Candidates may not have talked much about health care in the 1994 campaign, but some leading pollsters suggested today that the bitter 18-month-long struggle over the issue was crucial in stoking the attitudes at the heart of last week's election: anger, cynicism and disappointment with the Democrats.
Moreover, a new post-election survey released today showed that voters still expected Congress to do something to alter the health care system, but something decidedly modest and incremental.
Only 25 percent said they thought Congress should enact a major reform bill, according to the survey sponsored by Harvard's School of Public Health and the Kaiser Family Foundation; 41 percent said there should be modest changes and 25 percent said the system should be left alone.


Play in New U.S. League Won't Kick Off Until 1996
The World Cup may yet achieve its intended legacy of a first-rate professional soccer league in the United States, but not next year as planned.

A Candid Self-Portrait Of a Drag Queen in Mufti  Dixon Place
The most amusing riff in "My Tiny Life," a self-portrait written and performed by Mark F. Rizzo, an East Village drag queen also known as Hapi Phace, is a description of his "Zen apartment." Inside his minuscule one-room space, he says, he has crammed a stereo, an LP collection, a tape recorder, a television, a VCR, a CD player, a computer and a telephone answering machine.
Add to this a rice cooker, an electric coffee maker, a hot plate and several cooking contraptions advertised on television infomercials, and you have the clotted mess that Hapi shows on a video screen.

Wrong Defense, Wrong Enemy
Propelled by memories of the threat that Iraqi Scuds posed to U.S. troops and Israeli cities during the Persian Gulf war, the Clinton Administration is eager to test a variety of theater missile defenses.
The Republicans who control Congress would go one step further.
Many want to test anti-missile defenses to protect the continental U.S.
Both the Administration and the Republicans are making a mistake.
Advanced theater defenses -- and certainly defenses designed to protect America -- would undercut the 22-year-old Antiballistic Missile Treaty, threaten the Russians and complicate the essential task of persuading Moscow to reduce its still-formidable nuclear arsenal and secure it against smugglers.
Those who would test anti-missile defenses are trying to guard against threats that have yet to materialize while ignoring a clear and present danger.

Northern Ireland sought the extradition of the priest last year on charges related to acts of child molestation.
Attorney General Harry Whelehan never acted on repeated extradition warrants, but the priest, the Rev.
Brendan Smyth, eventually surrendered voluntarily, was convicted in June and began serving a four-year prison sentence.


NATO Keeps Bosnia Arms Blockade as U.S. Drops Role
Washington's allies in NATO said today that they would continue a sea blockade of arms shipments to the Muslim-led Bosnian Government even though American forces are no longer fully taking part.
A statement issued after a meeting of the alliance's 16 representatives in Brussels said Navy ships of the other member countries would enforce the blockade even though United States warships would no longer take action to keep arms from going to Bosnia or provide intelligence information on such shipments to the allies.

Weicker Gives Budget Plan But Rowland Sees Problem
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. today issued a budget plan for the next two years that would increase spending 7.3 percent without new taxes, but Governor-elect John G. Rowland immediately said he would reduce spending to make possible the income-tax cut he promised in his campaign.
Unlike four years ago, when Mr.
Weicker as Governor-elect was presented a proposed budget with a $1.6 billion revenue shortfall on top of a $562 million deficit for the current year, Mr.
Rowland received a two-year budget that was in balance and within the state's legal spending limit.

Ex-State Police Investigator Admits Evidence Tampering
Three weeks after saying he was pleading guilty to evidence tampering only because he was emotionally drained and could not afford to mount a defense, a former state police investigator admitted at his sentencing today that he had faked evidence in a 1992 Orange County burglary.
"I sincerely apologize for the harm and disgrace my actions have put on law-enforcement personnel," said the former investigator, Edward Pilus.
"I know that I have jeopardized the whole basis of the criminal-justice system and the reasons it was created."


In America; Scapegoat Time
Troubled times require the comforting presence of scapegoats.
I remember an incident many years ago in which a thin, bespectacled, awkward and dim-witted recruit at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., was beaten up by fellow soldiers who blamed him for a blizzard that had confined everybody to the base.
A delighted roar arose when the hapless recruit was tossed out of the barracks and into the snow.
The scapegoat had done his job.
He had made everybody feel better, even though nothing had changed.

News Staff Faces Layoffs At Journal
The Wall Street Journal told more than a dozen members of its news staff yesterday that they would be laid off as part of a cost-cutting move, the newspaper's managing editor said in an interview.

He was 85 and lived in London.
Sir Patrick gave up his law practice at the outbreak of World War II, joined the British Foreign Office and became a leading light of the British Foreign Service.
He was knighted in 1957 and retired from the Foreign Service in 1969.

The campaign, "Communities for Change: New Homes, New Hope," will support the foundation's efforts to develop affordable housing in low-income neighborhoods and link housing with social services.


A Debate on the Greater Evil: Inflation or Chill or Pink Slips
The Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates by the largest amount in years intensified a debate that focuses not so much on the amount of the rise but whether the Federal Reserve should have acted at all.
On one side are those who applauded the Federal Reserve's action, most of them on Wall Street.
They are challenged by an unlikely coalition of manufacturers and labor leaders who charged that yesterday's increase would slow the economy too much, cutting back sales and eliminating jobs.


Manley Released on Bail After Drug Arrest
DEXTER MANLEY, once one of the N.F.L.'s top defensive linemen, appeared in court yesterday after a crack cocaine arrest in Houston.
Manley, who was banned from the N.F.L. for violating the league's drug policy, was arrested Sunday night and was released Monday after posting $5,000 bail.
Yesterday, he made an initial appearance in court with his lawyer, PAULA ASHER, who said, "He is anxious to get this matter resolved." A Dec. 6 arraignment has been scheduled.
Manley, 36, failed the fourth drug test of his career in December 1991.
The defensive end later attempted a comeback, bouncing around the N.F.L. and the Canadian Football League.
He played for the C.F.L.

Coach Pete Carroll believes that in order for the Jets to be successful, they have to establish their running game, something they have had trouble doing this season.
The Jets could have a problem again on Sunday in Minneapolis, where their opponents, the Vikings, have the best run defense in the National Football League, averaging 61.8 yards per game.


Maturing Jazz Industry Opens Convention Tonight
The Jazz Times Convention starts tonight, which means that tired-looking, cigarette-smoking people from all over the world will gather to talk about what they heard last night, what kinds of deals can be cooked up today and who is sitting in with whom and where.
For the next four days, the convention becomes jazz's business paradise, with bookers, musicians, radio programmers, record company executives, agents, club owners and critics swarming like fish around a particularly fertile reef.
The convention started in Washington 10 years ago as a casual meeting of some of the disparate elements that make up the jazz world.
It has grown into big business, with attendance up nearly 20 percent from last year.
This year's version draws nearly 700 people from across the country, along with people from India, Sweden, Russia, England and more.
In its success, its internationalism and its growth, the convention suggests that jazz is taking itself more seriously as an industry, and flourishing because of it.


Kohl Elected to 4th Term as German Chancellor, but by a Hair
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was officially elected to a fourth term today, but members of Parliament gave him only a single vote more than the required majority, suggesting that his new Government may be weak and perhaps short-lived.
After the result was announced, a beaming Mr.
Kohl pledged to devote himself to the twin challenges of German and European unity.
"We need to grow closer, to exchange experiences, to recognize finally that reunited Germany is not a simple annexation of the former East Germany, but something new in the best sense of the word," he said.

Nets Answer Wake-Up Call And Triumph
They had an All-Star forward whose game needed an awakening and an exhausted All-Star guard whose body needed a rest.
So the Nets, daydreaming away the first month of the season, reached back into time tonight.
They inserted Eric (Sleepy) Floyd, who last played for the Nets in a regular-season game 12 years ago, into their backcourt.
Floyd, with droopy eyes and 34-year-old legs, teamed with a resilient Derrick Coleman and a refreshed Kenny Anderson to help wake the Nets from their early-season slumber.
Together, they sparked a team that was having better luck hitting its snooze button than its shots to a 112-106 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics before 15,310 at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.


Frederic Spiegelberg, Religion Teacher, 97
Frederic Spiegelberg, an early teacher of comparative religion in the United States, died on Thursday at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, where he lived.
He was 97.

Bronx Man Charged in Slaying of Executive
A 19-year-old Bronx man was charged with second-degree murder yesterday in the shooting death last month of an investment banker on a path near the Mayor's residence on the Upper East Side, the police said.
The suspect, Alexander Hernandez, of 318 East 198th Street, was arrested on drug charges Monday at 98th Street and Lexington Avenue by officers from a Manhattan North narcotics unit, said Sgt.
John McCluskey, a police spokesman.

Brian Dutton, a scholar of medieval Spanish literature, died on Oct. 21 at his home in Oak Park, Ill.
He was 59 and also had a home in Madison, Wis., where he taught at the University of Wisconsin.
The cause was cardiac arrest, said his daughter Anna Dutton, also of Oak Park.

Long-Bond Yield Dips After Fed's Tightening
The long end of the Treasury market rallied yesterday after the Federal Reserve announced its sixth and largest interest rate increase of the year, easing traders' fears of inflation.
By late in the day, the 30-year bond was up 8/32 , to a price of 9327/32 , for a yield of 8.05 percent, down from 8.07 percent on Monday.
Despite the rise in the long end of the Treasury market, prices in shorter maturities were mixed.


Toxicity Test Delaying Dredging to Reopen Marine Terminal
A plan to revitalize commercial shipping in New York City by reopening a marine terminal on Staten Island has been delayed for at least several months after contaminated sediment was unexpectedly found around the terminal's berths, port officials said yesterday.
The long-dormant terminal, Howland Hook, was supposed to have been dredged in the coming months so large freighters could use it.
But on Monday, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey learned that the material that was to have been scooped from the Arthur Kill failed a toxicity test.

A 38-year-old police officer who was chasing a drug suspect in East New York, Brooklyn, was shot in the ribs yesterday, but the bullet was stopped by a protective shield sewn into the officer's denim jacket, the police said.
The officer, Jacob Brown, a nine-year veteran of the force, was in good condition last night at Jamaica Hospital.


Pataki's Break: Mostly in Vermont
Governor-elect George E. Pataki did not spend his four-day holiday in New York State, as his aides said on Monday, but crossed the border to Vermont, where he stayed at the Equinox Hotel in Manchester, his spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said today.
She said Mr.
Pataki did visit friends in Washington County, north of Albany, but spent Friday through Sunday nights in Vermont.
Ms.

Libel Suit Against Prodigy Tests On-Line Speech Limits
The Prodigy Services Company, operator of one of the country's largest on-line information services, has agreed to help track down a computer user who posted an electronic message accusing a Long Island investment bank of fraud and other criminal activity.
Prodigy's move, agreed to late Monday in State Supreme Court in Nassau County, comes in response to a $100 million lawsuit charging libel and negligence by Prodigy and a subscriber, David Lusby of Key West, Fla.
The suit seeks $100 million more in punitive damages.

Smoke, Not Substance, at APEC
The leaders of 18 nations who gathered this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Indonesia arrived with lofty talk of achieving a sweeping agreement to stimulate economic growth on the Pacific Rim, already among the most vibrant economic regions in the world.
Their final communique enshrines a noble objective: free trade and investment by the year 2020.
Unfortunately, the APEC pledge fails to include a single substantive measure.
The easy task is to commit to a vague goal a quarter-century away.
The hard task -- apparently too hard -- is to take concrete measures that would challenge entrenched interests in each country.

Opera, Yes, And More From Ebony
Since 1974, Opera Ebony has been presenting minority singers in low-budget but inventive productions in Harlem, on tour and, lately, as part of the 651 series at the Majestic Theater of the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
It has offered an interesting repertory of mostly contemporary American works, particularly operas by minority composers or about aspects of black history.
And it has just released its first compact disk, "Done Crossed Every River" (Arcadia).
With all that behind it, the company celebrated its 20th anniversary on Monday evening at Alice Tully Hall with a concert that drew on everything from standard repertory (an aria from "Aida"), revamped standards (a song from "Carmen Jones") and excerpts from operas about Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, to spirituals, theater songs and jazz.


Pastrami on Rye, Hold the West Coast
Seeking the solace of salami and the balm of brisket amid the aftershocks of the 1993 earthquake, a long line of people gathered outside Nate 'n Al's, the venerable show-biz delicatessen here.
When some customers grew antsy at the wait, a counterman reminded them that they had a choice: they could always go down the block to the Carnegie Deli.
The Carnegie Deli.
In New York, the sound of those words would have been like chicken soup to shattered nerves.
But something was evidently lost in transit between Seventh Avenue and 54th Street, site of the flagship Carnegie, and the corner of North Beverly Drive and Dayton Way, its West Coast outpost.
At Nate 'n Al's that morning, no one even budged.

President-Elect In Brazil Aided By State Races
In victories likely to strengthen the free-market mandate of President-elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the governors' seats in Brazil's three most powerful states went to his allies today, according to preliminary returns and voter surveys.
"Fernando Henrique Cardoso will emerge from today's voting as the strongest President of the republican era," Teodomiro Braga, a political columnist, predicted, referring to Brazil's century-old system of elected government.
"Until today, no President elected by the people had the support of the majority in Congress and of the governors of Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio, states that represent 55 percent of the Brazilian GNP."

She wore her heart on her sleeve, and for 22 years she jammed her backhand volley -- one that won't be replicated and was rarely returned -- down the throats of any and all opponents who weren't savvy enough to get out of harm's way.
Last night in the opening round of the Virginia Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden, Martina Navratilova, the tennis dynamo generally regarded as the finest woman athlete to grace her sport, played her last-ever singles match under the same prestigious roof where she'd earned a record 18 titles.


Moscow Journal; Historian Looks Darkly at Russia, and Sees Light
One of Russia's most penetrating democratic voices, Yuri N. Afanasyev, has by his desk a bronze statue of Diogenes, lantern lifted, searching for a single honest man.
It is an obvious analogy for these times of moral improvisation in Russia, when so many officials and businessmen are seeking personal advantage to the detriment of a still-weak public spirit.
A handsome man with a wrestler's blocky build, Mr.
Afanasyev was one of the stars of Russia's perestroika period.
Now 60, a scholar of French history, he was a close colleague of Andrei D. Sakharov and other dissident intellectuals like Gavriil Popov, a former Mayor of Moscow.

2 Officers Are Acquitted of Assault on a Prisoner
Two New York City police officers were acquitted yesterday of assault charges in a case in which they were accused of causing a prisoner to become a virtual quadriplegic by slamming him violently into a station house door.
Saying that "sympathy cannot replace evidence," Justice Alan Marrus of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, who tried the case without a jury, returned the not guilty verdicts against the officers, Donald Alesi, 35, and Steven Zimmerman, 31.
The officers had exercised their right to have the judge try them.

Leaders Agree On Free Trade For the Pacific
The glow of Tuesday's victory of creating the largest free-trade zone in the Asia-Pacific region dissipated today as President Clinton and President Suharto of Indonesia clashed over the issue of Indonesia's much-criticized human rights record.

Clinton stated frankly that relations between the United States and Indonesia would not reach their full potential unless there was an improvement in human rights, a senior Administration official said.


Elizabeth G. Speare, 84, Author Of Children's Historical Novels
Elizabeth George Speare, an author of historical novels for children, died yesterday in Northwest General Hospital in Tucson, Ariz.
She was 84.
The cause was an aortic aneurysm, her family said.
Beginning in 1957 with "Calico Captive," Mrs.
Speare wrote a string of novels that soon became familiar to thousands of American schoolchildren.
Two of her early works, "The Witch of Blackbird Pond" (1958) and "The Bronze Bow" (1961), were awarded the Newbery Medal by the American Library Association.


Fed Move Sends Stocks on Roller Coaster
Stock traders had clamored for strong inflation-fighting medicine but swooned when they got it yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average initially plummeted almost 50 points after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by a surprisingly large three-quarters of a percentage point.
Barely an hour later, Wall Street was confronted by the consequences of getting what it wished for.
Large money-center banks like Citicorp and Wells Fargo raised their prime, or minimum, lending rate by three-quarters of a point, too.
By then, however, the market had turned and ended the day mixed but essentially unchanged, despite heavy trading.


Con Edison Agrees To $9 Million Fine For Contamination
Con Edison agreed yesterday to pay New York State a $9 million fine for illegally discharging oil and contaminants into New York Harbor, allowing contractors to dump waste from cleanup sites into the city's sewer system and ignoring complaints filed by state environmental officials.
The fine, for what the state charged were hundreds of violations, dating from 1984 to 1991, is the largest administrative penalty ever given by the Department of Environmental Conservation.

Aikman missed the last two plays of practice.
Aikman played in the Cowboys' 21-14 loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday with a swollen and bruised thumb on his passing hand and threw three interceptions.

U.S. Industry Had a Surge In October
American factories, mines and utilities stepped up their operating rate to nearly 85 percent of industrial capacity in October -- a level that had not been reached since 1980 during the Carter Administration.
A strong increase in output, pushing against industry's ability to turn out additional products without raising prices, contributed to the Federal Reserve's decision today to raise short-term interest rates yet again in an attempt to restrain the robust economy.

Market Place; After two recent acquisitions, more software mergers are likely.
TWO deals do not a trend make, especially two with as little in common as Microsoft's $1.5 billion acquisition of Intuit last month and Sybase's $940 million acquisition of Powersoft this week.
Still, investment bankers and analysts say they expect more software mergers, if not necessarily of this size.
Both deals filled specific gaps for the acquiring company.
The Microsoft Corporation had a personal finance program, Money, but its market share was a fraction of Intuit Inc.'s Quicken.
Sybase Inc. had applications development tools, but they were thought to lag behind those of its rivals in the data base management market, the Oracle Corporation and the Informix Corporation; in the Powersoft Corporation, it acquired the market's leading tool, Powerbuilder.


Sergeant Pleads Guilty in Harlem Thefts
The police sergeant who supervised a band of officers accused of corruption in the troubled 30th Precinct in Harlem pleaded guilty yesterday to breaking Federal law during what investigators say was a two-year binge of theft.

Bumper Crops Pose Political Problem for Farmers
The nation's farmers have been reaping their most bountiful harvest ever in many important crops, benefiting shoppers for groceries from meat to cooking oil but costing taxpayers an estimated $3 billion to $4 billion in additional farm subsidies.
Production of corn, the nation's biggest crop, is expected to reach 10.01 billion bushels, nearly 5.6 percent higher than 1992's record crop and almost 60 percent more than last year when the Midwest flooded and the Southeast baked, according to Department of Agriculture estimates released last Wednesday.
Production also soared to new records for rice and soybeans, which are widely used in animal feed, cooking oil and food ingredients.
Wheat crops, while short of records, were larger than average.

But state officials said that Mr.
Glendening, who now leads 704,818 to 698,754, is likely to be declared the winner when the outstanding ballots are counted.

In setting their vast and vital region on the path toward free trade by the year 2020, the leaders of 18 nations around the Pacific Ocean have taken a step that appears to be a bold move toward the future.
But whether it will truly be so judged by history will depend not so much on what the leaders said today but on how their "declaration of common resolve" is translated into action.
Carrying out the free trade agreement will be far more arduous and contentious than merely enunciating the vision.

Stephen Dykes Bower, a British church architect skilled in the Gothic style, died on Friday in Quendon, 20 miles north of London.
He was 91 and lived in Quendon.
Mr.

From 1951 to 1973, he held the title of Surveyor of the Fabric of the abbey.
The newspaper The Independent said on Monday: "Dykes Bower found the Abbey hidden beneath the dust of centuries. He left it as a unified work of art, its disparate elements brought into harmony."


Rockefeller Center May Face Mortgage Default
The Rockefeller Group, the company that owns Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, lacks the cash to make the mortgage payments and may be close to defaulting on the loan, according to a Government filing by the company that holds the $1.3 billion mortgage on the property.

In October 1989, the heirs of John D. Rockefeller Jr., sold a controlling interest in the property to the Mitsubishi Estate Company, one of the world's largest real estate companies.

Gold Glove: It's New Garb For Boggs, Old For Mattingly
Don Mattingly's remarkable play at first base has made him synonymous with fielding excellence for a decade.
Wade Boggs's steady play at third base has rarely forced anyone to include his name in the same sentence with Brooks Robinson.
Until this season.
Boggs, who has long been lauded for his hitting while earning five batting titles, added a new wrinkle to his portfolio yesterday when he joined Mattingly as one of nine players to receive the American League Rawlings Gold Glove Award for 1994.
By winning his first Gold Glove in his 13th season, the 36-year-old Boggs is perhaps the player who has logged the most service time before corralling the award.
Rawlings was unsure whether another winner had matched or surpassed Boggs's longevity-without-gold streak.

Now, Coach Dan Reeves must decide which quarterback -- Brown or Graham -- will start Monday night against the Oilers in the Houston Astrodome.
He said he would decide Wednesday.
All signs point to Brown's recapturing the job for this week and the rest of the season.

New Look at Disputed Study Is Reassuring on Lumpectomy
Women who have breast cancer that has not spread outside the breast can almost always safely choose a lumpectomy followed by radiation rather than a mastectomy, researchers concluded at a workshop here today.
The meeting, held by the National Cancer Institute, was called in the aftermath of disconcerting questions raised recently about the relative efficacy of mastectomy and lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy.
In a mastectomy, most or all of the breast is removed, while in a lumpectomy, only the lump and immediately surrounding tissue is removed.
In 1990, a consensus conference called by the cancer institute confidently stated that lumpectomy followed by radiation was as effective as mastectomy in preventing recurrence of cancer for a vast majority of women with early breast cancer.

Clinton Outlines Plan to Bolster Europe-Wide Security
President Clinton will join the leaders of Russia, Germany, France and Britain in Budapest next month to sign an agreement aimed at helping European and former Soviet-bloc countries resolve conflicts before they lead to war, American officials said today.
The Administration wants to accomplish this by transforming the 53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe into a stronger group specializing in conflict resolution and peacekeeping.

Israel Turns Over More Responsibility to Palestinian Authority
Israel handed over responsibility for tourism and social services in the West Bank today to the Palestinian Authority.
The transfer was part of an agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to move five spheres of authority in the West Bank to Palestinian control as a step toward extending self-rule beyond Jericho and the Gaza Strip.

Assembly Speaker Voices Doubts On Pataki's Pledge to Cut Taxes
Starting to build a Democratic case against Governor-elect George E. Pataki's central campaign promise, the Assembly Speaker said today that it would be difficult to cut taxes as quickly and deeply as Mr.
Pataki has pledged, and added that the Assembly Democrats might offer a tax-cutting plan of their own.
The Speaker, Sheldon Silver, said at a news conference in Albany that New Yorkers would "understand if, in fact, any tax cuts have to go slower than were promised in the campaign."


Banesto Criminal Charges
Spanish prosecutors filed charges today against Mario Conde, the dismissed chairman of the Banco Espanol de Credito, and nine of his executives, formally accusing them with misappropriating funds, manipulating stock prices and falsifying documents.
The prosecutors are demanding a bond of almost $97 million against civil damages that Mr.
Conde and his management team are said to have caused.


Guidelines For Classes On Civics Are Issued
National educational standards for civics and government were announced today, provoking less criticism than did the recently unveiled standards for American and world history.
Noting that only 37 percent of the electorate voted in last week's midterm election, some of the participants at today's announcement in a chamber at the United States Supreme Court saw a connection between the lack of civics teaching and the decline in what Thomas Jefferson called "enlightened people."


New Judge In a Crucial Tobacco Case
A Federal judge in New Orleans reassigned a much-watched tobacco-liability case to another Federal judge yesterday, postponing a crucial hearing scheduled for today on a landmark class-action lawsuit.
The court will determine whether, for the first time, the tobacco industry can be sued for addicting huge numbers of smokers to cigarettes.
The judge, Frederick J. R. Heebe, was to have heard arguments today from representatives of a consortium of 60 of the nation's most prominent lawyers, who have mounted a campaign against the industry that will cost them $100,000 per firm, or $6 million a year, in expenses.


Ruling in City College Demotion Suit Is Greeted With Concern
Academics and legal experts reacted with concern yesterday to the Supreme Court's order that the City College of New York be given a second chance to defend the demotion of its black studies chairman, who has been accused of bigotry.

Concern Over Airline Safety
A study by the National Transportation Safety Board and an investigation by New York Times reporters cast a disturbing light on airline safety rules and regulations.
The Safety Board, focusing on commuter airlines, said all but their smallest aircraft, and the people who fly them, should meet the same safety standards as major carriers.
The Times's investigation of USAir, the nation's sixth-largest carrier, indicated that even major carriers' safety procedures can be flawed.
Flying is still safer than driving to the airport.
But two recent devastating crashes -- one on a commuter airline, American Eagle, and the other on USAir -- have heightened public concern.


Enthusiasm Is Lacking During the Knicks' Trip
The Knicks have not played their first five games with the intensity that has become their signature.
So before today's practice at the Forum, Coach Pat Riley met with the team briefly and voiced his displeasure, followed by a hard, 90-minute workout.
With 77 games to play, it is too early for the Knicks (3-2) to panic.
But New York is 0-2 on this four-game trip, facing back-to-back games against the Lakers on Wednesday and the Golden State Warriors on Thursday.
Riley has seen enough lethargic play, and he made it clear that if the Knicks do not play with more effort, they will not win.

Cliburn Competition Winner's Debut
By a curious turn of fashion, winning a music competition has become a liability.
Audiences have spent too many boring hours listening to the pearly touch of human player pianos; juries have proven themselves better at judging technique and proficiency than insight and musicianship.
Competitions are, properly, on the defensive.
So what a pleasure it was on Monday night in Carnegie Hall to hear the gold medalist of the ninth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, and to feel that this was the New York debut of a musician rather than a pianist -- not a fully formed musician, perhaps, but a fascinating musician nonetheless.
The Italian pianist Simone Pedroni was 24 when he won the contest in 1993, and is the highest-ranking veteran of the Cliburn wars to play in New York in recent months; Frederic Chiu appeared in the spring, Armen Babakhanyan gave a debut concert a few weeks ago that received critical plaudits, and Fabio Bidini, who played here last February, will give a recital at Tully Hall in December.
Mr.
Pedroni bested them all in the Van Cliburn Competition, but judging from this performance, he did so without resorting to the typical competition weaponry.


Clinton Devises New Guidelines On Arms Sales
Making explicit a policy that has existed in practice for three years, the Clinton Administration is preparing new guidelines that will consider the health of the nation's military contractors when reviewing arms sales to foreign countries.
Such sales require approval from the United States Government, which has ruled on arms sales in the past based on whether they bolstered American foreign policy goals and strengthen regional alliances.
Under a plan now before the President, a sale's benefit to the nation's shrinking military industry would also be considered.

As the Zagat Turns
The Zagat Survey of New York City Restaurants for 1995 has just been published.
Bouley is again rated highest for food, with a 29 (out of a possible 30), followed by Aureole, Lespinasse and La Grenouille with 28.
Last year, only Aureole had a 28.
It seems the surveyors think New York food is improving, because this year 18 places were rated 27 or better, compared with only 10 last year.


Health Care Awards Given
The New York Festivals has named the first winners of its international awards competition honoring health care communications work.

City Council Offers Plans On Budget
Opening negotiations with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani over his plan to close a $1.1 billion budget gap with deep spending cuts, the City Council revealed a wish list of alternatives yesterday, including the creation of an authority to oversee recycling, an increase in taxi medallions and the consolidation of nearly a dozen of New York City's agencies.
The Council's plan also included charging more for licenses and permits, turning the Staten Island Ferry over to the state and eliminating 2 of the 12 paid holidays city employees now receive.
The Council also proposed raising money by leasing the 79th Street Boat Basin, franchising Offtrack Betting parlors and selling air rights above city buildings, including City Hall, to real-estate developers to raise cash.


AT THE MOVIES WITH: Paul Rudnick; Would Libby, Like, Even Read This?
DOES Libby like "Stargate"?
You bet.
Big time.
No need to ask, really.
How could a movie in which Kurt Russell kicks keister among the ancient Egyptians at the far end of the universe fail to enchant Libby Gelman-Waxner, the monthly film critic for Premiere magazine and the finest judge of cinematic art ever to come out of Great Neck, L.I.?
"Libby is guided primarily by trailers, and 'Stargate' resembles 40 trailers back to back," says Paul Rudnick, Libby's creator, dissecting the film at a Times Square restaurant around the corner from the Criterion Center, where he has just seen it.
"Also, Libby is a huge Kurt Russell fan, although in this film he seems to be playing an angry shaving brush." (The reference is to Mr. Russell's coif, the fiercest-looking crew cut since Michael Douglas's buzz job in "Falling Down.")

Recount Shows Rep. Gejdenson Wins in Connecticut by 4 Votes
After seven days of counting and recounting, Sam Gejdenson, a seven-term Democratic Congressman from eastern Connecticut, was declared the victor today in his bid for re-election -- by four votes out of 186,000 cast.
But his Republican opponent, Edward W. Munster, vowed to challenge the results of the Second District vote all the way, if necessary, to the new Republican-controlled Congress, which has the final say in the seating of its members.
The election has already made the record books as one of only eight Congressional races settled by a single-digit vote margin in this century.

Whirlpool to Shut 2 Plants and Cut Work Force
Continuing a trend among large companies of cutting employment even in times of prosperity, the Whirlpool Corporation said today that it would close two North American factories and reduce its worldwide work force by more than 8 percent.
The cutbacks will result in a one-time charge of $240 million against earnings in the current quarter but are expected eventually to save $150 million in annual operating expenses.
Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Mich., has earned $249 million on sales of $6 billion in the first nine months of the year.
The company has a worldwide work force of about 40,000 employees.

Corrections
An article on Sunday about a landlord-tenant dispute at the Belnord apartment building on the Upper West Side described one aspect of an agreement between the new owners of the building and some tenants incorrectly.
The agreement calls for the owners to pay $670,000 directly to the tenants association, and also to provide rent credits to some tenants that the tenants' lawyer said would total about $3 million; it does not call for a direct payment of about $4 million.

10 Percent of Islanders Sold

"In exchange for that, we converted the loan to equity, which makes the team a lot stronger financially."

Nicholas R. Anthonisen of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, is being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md.

When a Tax Resembles a Salary Cap
Anyone deliriously optimistic about the so-called breakthrough in negotiations in the three-month-old baseball strike hasn't been paying attention to the negotiations in the month-and-a-half-old hockey lockout.
The National Hockey League has a taxing problem, and baseball is about to get one, too.
N.H.L. owners have been unable to induce their players to accept a luxury tax on payrolls, and baseball club owners are virtually certain to find the same resistance if they propose a luxury tax along similar lines.


Arrest of Released Sex Offender Unnerves New England Region
Despite police warnings that he remained a "chronic sexual predator," Ronald W. Caron was released from jail here eight days ago, then arrested on Monday amid concern that he was returning to his old patterns of behavior.
His release from the Strafford County Jail here on Nov. 7, after serving a term on a sex charge, set off a highly publicized search in which he was tracked to Portland, Me., where, the authorities say, he offered beer to two teen-agers in an effort to lure them into sex, and back to New Hampshire, where he was arrested on a charge of trespassing at a day care center in nearby Rochester.


Space Telescope Leaves Scientists Puzzled About the Mass of the Universe
The Hubble Space Telescope looked deep into the sky and what it did not see has left cosmologists more mystified than ever about the unseen stuff out there, called dark matter, that may account for at least 90 percent of the universe's mass.
Astronomers using the orbiting telescope reported yesterday that their observations ruled out the possibility that dim small stars, known as red dwarfs, are plentiful enough to constitute much of the invisible mass.
For almost three decades, this had been the most favored explanation by astronomers for the mass they could not see but could infer from gravitational forces shaping galactic structures.


A New Analysis Casts Doubt On the Superiority of Olive Oil
ONE of the firmer tenets of nutrition, a notably slippery subject, has been that olive oil is better for the heart than, say, corn oil and safflower oil.
So said a study published nine years ago, which gained considerable support from the very low rates of heart disease found among Mediterranean cultures that consume more olive oil than any other dietary fat.
But an analysis presented yesterday by Dr.
Christopher Gardner of Stanford University at a meeting of the American Heart Association in Dallas seems to suggest otherwise.
There is little to be gained, he found, from switching from the polyunsaturated oils like corn, soybean and sunflower to canola oil or to the more costly olive oil.

With the Steelers' offense sputtering like a car about to run out of gas, the return of running back Barry Foster is a welcome sign.

The Steelers defeated Buffalo, 23-10, on Monday night with the help of three field goals by Gary Anderson and two touchdowns by their defense.
Cornerback Rod Woodson returned an interception 37 yards for a score; Woodson also sacked Bills quarterback Jim Kelly at the Buffalo 1 and defensive end Gerald Williams recovered the fumble in the end zone for a touchdown.

Kodak Plans To Eliminate 800 More Jobs
The Eastman Kodak Company, which has been trimming its ranks for several years to cut operating costs, announced yesterday that it would eliminate about 800 jobs at its big Kodak Park manufacturing complex in Rochester.
The cutbacks will take place by the end of the first quarter of 1995, the company said in a statement.
The cuts will come in the company's core film manufacturing business, but will not involve production workers.
Office workers and other staff that support the production process will be the target of the reduction, a spokesman said.


Personal Health; Clinical trials: the bogged-down hub of progress.
THIRTY-ODD years ago when I became a science and health writer, cancer treatment was a hit-or-miss affair that relied mostly on surgery and mop-up radiation therapy.
Only a handful of children with acute leukemia and only about a quarter of children with solid tumors survived.
Women dreaded breast cancer not only for its life-threatening implications but also because the diagnosis inevitably meant mutilating surgery: a radical mastectomy.
Today the picture is far brighter.
About 90 percent of youngsters with acute leukemia, Wilms's tumor and Hodgkin's disease are being cured.
Overall survival for solid tumors in children is now 70 percent.
And the standard treatment for most breast cancers is now minimal tumor-removing surgery with radiation, chemotherapy or both to reduce the risk of recurrence.

He had to have 16 teams to fill the 1994 tournament, and for anybody who disdains his selections the argument begins tonight.
That's when 12 of the teams face off in campus games to begin the road to Madison Square Garden, with 4 others due to play first-round games tomorrow.

JUMP IS LARGEST SINCE 1981
Determined to prevent strong economic growth from feeding inflation, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates today by the largest amount since 1981 and left open the possibility of further increases.
Banks followed by raising the rates they charge for loans.
The increases are likely to show up immediately in the rates charged millions of Americans on everything from home equity loans to credit cards to small-business loans.
Already, interest rates on 30-year mortgages that were available at slightly more than 7 percent at the start of the year have risen to 9.05 percent.


As It Scrubs Down Its Art, Rome Takes The Brush to Itself
Nowadays, when you stand on the Campidoglio, Michelangelo's piazza atop the Capitoline Hill, you can clearly see the cleaned corkscrew dome of Sant'Ivo della Sapienza, which Borromini designed, rising among the city's rooftops.
The spanking white facades of San Andrea della Valle and the Church of the Gesu punctuate the gritty Corso Vittorio Emanuele, the busy street leading from the bridge over the Tiber to the Vatican.
Across town, the exterior of the giant Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore has been thoroughly scrubbed.
Inside, its patterned floor, medieval mosaics, delicate wood-coffered ceiling and voluminous chapels have been given the once-over, too.
The news that draws busloads of tourists each day is the much-touted restoration of Michelangelo's "Last Judgment," the fresco on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican, not to mention the chapel's restored ceiling.
But all across Rome, a wave of refurbished churches and palazzi, as well as repainted facades, in colors like pale blue and orange sherbet, have begun to change the look of this ancient capital.


Clinton Aide Criticizes G.O.P. Plans for Tax Cuts
President Clinton's budget director said today that it was nonsense for Republicans to suggest that tax cuts would pay for themselves by stimulating economic activity.
The director insisted that such cuts had to be offset by reductions in Federal spending.
The director, Alice M. Rivlin, said she feared that the Republicans taking charge of Congress would lead the nation into "a tax-cutting frenzy" that would increase the Federal budget deficit.
She thus attacked an economic theory that has been an article of faith for many Republicans, including those who orchestrated the Republican takeover of the House.


A 3-D Film Gets Its Broadway Debut

This will be the first exhibition of an Imax 3-D film in this country, although it has appeared in Japan and Europe.

Stopping Sex Abuse in Schools
Sexual abuse of children is one of those issues that easily leads to overreaction.
All the more reason to welcome sensible recommendations from a special commission on how the New York City school system should handle child sex abuse.
It has not been a huge problem.
Since 1991 the special investigator for the school system, Edward Stancik, has substantiated 110 allegations of abuse by school employees.
That is not horrific for a system of one million students and about 90,000 teachers and school staff members.


BUSINESS DIGEST
The Economy
The sharpest increase in interest rates since 1981 was made by the Federal Reserve.
The central bank raised the discount rate and the Federal funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point each.
Big banking companies, including Citicorp, soon followed suit, raising the minimum rates they charge for loans.  [ Page A1. ]


Cortines May Seize District
Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines yesterday summoned the board of Brooklyn's largest school district to a meeting on Monday, a move that could lead to his seizing control of the troubled district.
If he does, it will be the second time for District 17, which includes 26 schools in Crown Heights and East Flatbush.
Three and a half years ago, the district was in such disarray that then Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez took control.

Commuter Airlines Need Tougher Rules, Panel Says
The National Transportation Safety Board said today that commuter airline pilots fly more hours than major-carrier pilots but receive less training, less help on safety issues, less help from ground personnel and less rest between flights.
The board said there was no justification for the differences and called on the Federal Aviation Administration to put most commuter operations under the same rules the big airlines must follow.

QE2 Has a Sample Sale
WHEN more than 1,500 pieces of furniture that once graced the Queen Elizabeth 2 luxury liner docked at local Salvation Army thrift stores this week, the waiting crowds got a royal disappointment.
"To be honest, I was expecting a lot better than what I see," said Kevin Madison, a Salvation Army district supervisor.
He was filling in for the absent manager of Store No. 5, at 268 West 96th Street, between Broadway and West End Avenue.
"The phone's been ringing off the hook," Mr.
Madison added somewhat incredulously.
"I mean, nothing's wrong with the stuff, but I do wonder what all the fuss is about."


A Stolen Old Master Painting Is Bought Back for Poland
A Dutch Old Master painting stolen from a Polish museum by German forces during World War II has been bought for the Polish Government in a convoluted deal that some experts deplore as ransom.
The 17th-century Gabriel Metsu painting, called "The Washerwoman," was flown to Warsaw from New York on Tuesday after payment of about $65,000 to an anonymous collector who had consigned the work to Sotheby's nearly two years ago for auction.
The painting was withdrawn by the auction house after a Polish art restorer in New Jersey spotted the work in a Sotheby's catalogue and questioned its sale.


Report Blames School's Staff In Drowning
A Bronx eighth-grader drowned on a field trip last summer in part because six adults from his school let 138 pupils loose to roam a 187-acre water park without even knowing who could swim, a special school investigator has concluded.
And once the boy was reported missing, an assistant principal failed to act, the investigator found.
The scathing report from the Special Commissioner of Investigation for the New York City Schools accuses the teachers and administrators of Intermediate School 166 of gross misjudgment, detailing how on June 14, 1994, they left the Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom near Allentown, Pa., even though they knew 14-year-old Daniel Maracallo had not been found.
When the buses arrived back at his school, the report says, two teachers went home to watch a Knicks game even though some students stayed behind, unattended, waiting for parents.


'Incredible Universe' Seeks a Big New York Bang
National retailers of consumer electronics have squeezed smaller competitors out of one American city after another in recent years, following a pattern set by discount department stores and mammoth supermarkets.

Prestone Account Placed in Review
Young &amp; Rubicam New York said yesterday that after almost a decade it had "amicably agreed" to end its handling of the Prestone line of antifreeze and automotive products because the brand's ownership had changed.
As a result, the account of the Prestone Products Corporation, with billings estimated at $3 million, has been placed in review.
Prestone was acquired in July by Vestar Capital Partners in New York from the First Brands Corporation in Danbury, Conn., which hired Y.&amp; R. New York in 1985.
The agency said it was concerned about "conflict situations" between Prestone Products and First Brands because Y.&amp; R. New York continues to handle First Brands' automotive aftermarket products, with billings estimated at more than $12 million.


In Fearful Thrift, Elderly Forage in Garbage Bins
A gray-haired man in a blue Yankees cap lifts the lid of a garbage bin next to a supermarket.
Peering inside, he pulls out a tray of mushrooms still wrapped in plastic and slips it surreptitiously into a small gym bag.
A few minutes later, a man in his 80's walks to another of the three green bins outside the market.
He forages through the garbage, using his cane to stir the bottom, and removes a red pepper, some potatoes, an apple and wilted broccoli.


Two for the Seesaw: Graham Is Out, Brown Is In
This morning, quarterback Kent Graham was told by Dan Reeves that he was being benched in favor of Dave Brown.
Graham was infuriated but kept his composure and asked his head coach for another chance.
There would be no other chance.
The decision had been made.
Graham then saw his teammates and told them what Reeves had said.
They were perhaps more shocked than he was but not as angry.
They, along with several Giants assistants, tried to calm Graham down throughout the morning and early afternoon after he said he was going to rip Reeves to the news media.

She won the women's 400-meter freestyle at the world swimming championships in September with a time of 4 minutes 9.64 seconds.

Pierce Comes Back to Top Coetzer
Last year, Mary Pierce showed up in the spotlight at Madison Square Garden for all the right reasons.
Instead of having her identity linked to the ongoing family soap opera that starred her estranged and abusive father, Jim, she made a name for herself as a genuine prospect, not a mere curiosity, by defeating Martina Navratilova and Gabriela Sabatini to reach the semifinals of the Virginia Slims Championships.
Last night, after a testy, tremulous beginning, Pierce used her most reliable tactic, brute force, to get past her opening-round opponent, Amanda Coetzer of South Africa.

Man in the News; The Victor (Again): Bonn's Long-Distance Runner -- Helmut Kohl
The narrow confirmation of Chancellor Helmut Kohl as head of the German Government with one vote to spare in Parliament on Tuesday put him one step closer to his goal of holding power longer than Konrad Adenauer, his mentor and Germany's first postwar leader, did -- 14 years.

Whether his shaky coalition Government can hold together for a full four-year term has been the subject of intense speculation since its heavy losses in the Oct. 16 national elections, but Mr.
Kohl, a trained historian who remembers that Adenauer's first election in 1949 was also by a bare majority, says he has no doubts.

For New Top Marketer, G.M. Goes Outside Auto Industry
The General Motors Corporation said yesterday that it had reached outside its ranks -- outside the auto industry, in fact -- to fill what may be one of the toughest jobs in Corporate America: G.M.'s top North American marketing post.
In the position, an executive is responsible for whipping G.M.'s fractious and overlapping car and truck divisions into line, convincing its independent dealers to sell vehicles more effectively and luring back customers burned by quality problems in the past.
And for the job so crucial to G.M.'s success, the company chose an official who has been marketing sunglasses and contact lenses.


'Ooh, Ahh' Stage Left. 'Humbug!' Stage Right.
IN Dickens's "Christmas Carol," Scrooge is as selfish as he is wealthy.
Bob Cratchit, his clerk, is as loving as he is poor.
When a musical version of the story begins previews next Wednesday at the Paramount, on Seventh Avenue at 32d Street in Manhattan, the gulf between the rich and the poor will be instantly evoked in the set designs by Tony Walton and the costumes by William Ivey Long.
Dickens's story takes place in the 1840's.
Mike Ockrent, the show's director, set the musical in the 1880's, with a flashback to the 1830's.
"The 1880's was the time of England's maximum financial power," Mr.
Walton said, "and polarized the comparison between the rich and the poor."
Scrooge's nephew, Fred, lives in a house (at left) with gilt picture frames, voluptuously upholstered furniture and masses of candelabra.
The Cratchit house (above) has drab walls, mismatched furniture and beds no better than pallets.

36 Accused of Committing Violent Crimes in Quest to Join Mafia
They are known in the underworld as "wannabes," ambitious criminals who hope to become full-fledged Mafia members by committing violent crimes and sharing their spoils with mob leaders.
Before dawn yesterday, Federal agents and New York City officers swept up 36 men they identified as "wannabes" and accused them of engaging in dozens of hijackings, street robberies and narcotics deals and selling machine guns and automatic weapons to mobsters and other criminals in the city.
In the charges, agents and prosecutors listed a bevy of street names that were commonly used by some defendants, including Sal the Geep, Tony the Nose, Jack Five Hands, Matty Square and Blond Joe.
Wives of two of the men were also arrested.

One of the world's greatest players and theorists became an octogenarian last week.
Alvin Roth, who devised the forcing no-trump response to a major opening, the negative double, the unusual no-trump, and many other significant bidding ideas, lived most of his life in New York City but now lives in Boca Raton, Fla.
He was given an 80th birthday party during a tournament in Orlando, Fla., and had an opportunity as South to demonstrate his playing skill on the diagramed deal.
One would expect North-South to play in three no-trump, making 10 or 11 tricks, but Roth and his partner, Bernard Chazen of Tamarac, Fla., were trying to make up lost ground and climbed optimistically to six diamonds.


War on Kurds Hurts Turks in U.S. Eyes
As Turkey's war with Kurdish separatists has become ever more violent and uncompromising, the Government has faced a predicament: the more it succeeds, by its own accounts, the more it loses the tolerance of the United States and other Western allies concerned about its increasingly harsh tactics.
Now, the rift is deeper than ever.


Sports of The Times; Ravitch's Pen Is Simply Not A Collectible

Thinking as the Fed Thinks
After yesterday's benign inflation report -- consumer prices edged up a minuscule one-tenth of a percent -- even more people were left scratching their heads over the Fed's big interest rate increase on Tuesday.
What on earth, many asked, were Alan Greenspan, the moderate Republican who serves as Fed chairman, and Alan S. Blinder, the liberal Democrat who is vice chairman, thinking?
It is certainly true that there are few signs that inflation is a problem now.
The broad measures of prices generally look quite reassuring.
Producer prices, as well as the consumer prices that the Labor Department reported yesterday, have been rising slowly.  [ Page D6. ]

Legal Setback for F.T.C. in Bid to Block Tobacco Merger
The Federal Trade Commission suffered a setback yesterday in its attempt to block the planned merger of American Tobacco and Brown &amp; Williamson as a Federal judge denied an F.T.C. request for a court order to bar what the Government termed anticompetitive practices by the Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation.
The hourlong hearing was marked by repeated skeptical questioning of the commission's lawyer and some sharp statements by the judge, Milton Pollack, in the Federal District Court in Manhattan.
At one point, the judge said that he suspected there was a "cabal" at the American Tobacco Company opposed to the merger.


In a Newark Manor, Remains of the Day
WHAT Edith Wharton's fictional high-society characters did in Manhattan -- fret about social status while lounging on red velvet sofas -- the Ballantine family, of the brewery fortune, did in real life in Newark.
The house where they did so, a 27-room Victorian mansion built in 1885, reopens Dec. 10 after a two-year, $4 million renovation.
The mansion, a national historic landmark, has been a part of the Newark Museum since 1937 and serves as the decorative arts wing of the museum's four-building complex.
Its renovation added four new period rooms (for a total of nine) and six new galleries.


Mitsubishi Plays Down Its Mortgage Problems
Not many publicly listed companies here speak candidly with stock analysts, so when the Mitsubishi Estate Company invited some analysts for discussions in recent weeks, they attended eagerly.
Mitsubishi Estate's officials talked about the state of the battered property market here, the company's slowly recovering occupancy rates and signs that the condominium market may be rebounding.
But the most important -- and revealing -- aspect of the meetings was what the company chose not to say: In New York, an affiliated company was disclosing in a routine Government filing that Rockefeller Center, the trophy property in Manhattan that Mitsubishi Estate has controlled since 1989, was in serious financial straits.
The filing made it clear that Mitsubishi Estate and its partners may default on the mortgage on the property.

Julio Mateo Tecum, the director of Grupo Cultural Uk'Ux Pop Wuj, seeks to preserve folk dances that reflect the Mayan influence on Guatemalan culture.
Probably only anthropologists can ascertain how scrupulously authentic the company's stagings are.
But this troupe from Chicicastenango certainly offered a fascinating and artistically persuasive program in its American debut on Tuesday night at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center.
The presentation was part of the Southern Exposure series sponsored by the arts center and Pan American Musical Research Inc.
It was an evening of gentle dancing to live and recorded music for flutes and percussion.
Many steps were variations on graceful hops.
Performers in monkey masks became well-mannered, good-natured simians.
A man in a bull mask hopped companionably with dancers whose dignified masks made them resemble venerable kings.
Another scene inspired by animals involved fleet dancers in deer masks.
A corn-planting ritual looked joyous, and couples in a courtship ceremony expressed affection with an endearing shyness.

The cause was cancer, said Roy Brocksmith, a friend.


Let the Democrats Act More Like Democrats; Divided We Stand
To the Editor:
I listened to President Clinton's post-election news conference (front page, Nov. 10).
It was striking to me, a European-born American, how he dwelt on the message that "the American people" sent on Election Day and how he planned to heed this message.


No Plans for Soon-to-Be Former Governor
It has come to this for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
"Governor Jim Florio called me yesterday," Mr.
Cuomo explained to a radio interviewer yesterday about a call on Tuesday.
"He says, 'So Mario, what's to be, here?' I said I think finally I'm going to have a legacy. Jan. 1, I don't have a place to live. I don't have a job. I'm going to be the first homeless, unemployed, former 12-year governor in the history of the state. By Jan. 9, I can picture myself all huddled, freezing on a cold pavement, you know, chilling my tush, telling some guy with a seven-day growth of beard, 'I don't want to go to your lousy shelter.' "


Rose on Rose
The ultimate football fan -- a man who calls football his favorite sport both as a player and a spectator -- sat at a back table yesterday at New York's newest eponymous football emporium, and solemnly declared:
"I am baseball's greatest ambassador."


Bosnia Chief Asks U.N.  To Act to Halt Serbian Drive
Bosnia's President appealed to the United Nations and NATO today for immediate action to halt an offensive by nationalist Serbs on Bihac, a Muslim enclave in northwestern Bosnia that was designated a United Nations "safe area" last year.
United Nations troops reported heavy shelling and evidence of infantry clashes around the broad Bihac pocket.
But no significant military action was reported inside a zone that United Nations commanders have tentatively sketched out as the so-called safe area, a United Nations military spokesman said.

Bishops Vote to Expand Women's Roles in Church
The nation's Roman Catholic bishops voted overwhelmingly today to explore alternative ways for women to attain leadership positions in the church, while acknowledging that sexism persists among "some members."
"We commit ourselves to enhancing the participation of women in every possible aspect of church life," the bishops said in their first major policy statement on women since Pope John Paul II ruled out women's priestly ordination in May.


Let the Democrats Act More Like Democrats
To the Editor:
The 1994 Republican landslide occurred because a small group of swing voters voted more Republican than they usually do.
To recover, the Democrats must deal not only with the anger of those voters, but with the apathy of the 10-times-larger group that didn't vote.


Mayor Announces New Assault on Graffiti, Citing Its Toll on City
In his continuing assault on so-called quality-of-life crimes, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday announced a sweeping program to use more than a dozen city agencies to combat graffiti.
The initiative ranges from establishing a 24-hour police telephone line to report graffiti vandalism to a new Cultural Affairs Department program in which murals would be used as alternative outlets of expression for graffiti artists.


Economic Scene; Some creative ways Republicans could deliver on the contract.
FASTER than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, the new Congressional Republican majority is about to sweep away despised taxes, smash the pork barrel and balance the budget, all while leaping tall buildings in a single bound.
That, at least, is the promise of Newt Gingrich, Richard Armey, Phil Gramm and other "new" Republicans who have taken the election as a mandate for a conservative revolution.
The real question is how far they are willing to go -- or can go -- to push an agenda that promises everything without explaining how it could be delivered.
While numerous variations are possible, two core strategies seem most plausible.


The Children of Guantanamo
What a difference three months make.
Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, has been safely re-elected as Governor of Florida.
Fidel Castro is again preventing his people from setting out in rafts, and a U.S.-occupied Haiti is no longer sending forth masses of terrified refugees.
As a result, the refugee question has cooled as a political issue in Florida and the Clinton Administration is testing the waters for another refugee policy U-turn.
For 28 years Cuban refugees arriving in the U.S. were automatically admitted under a double standard that distinguished them from other people fleeing government oppression and economic collapse.
But in August the Clinton Administration began intercepting Cubans at sea, taking them to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and proclaiming that they would never be admitted to the U.S.


Drug Screening to Be Required for Some Welfare Recipients
A new work-for-welfare plan by the Giuliani administration will require single, childless people who say they cannot work for medical reasons to undergo a medical exam and drug test in order to get benefits, officials said yesterday.
The screening will be part of a plan, set to begin in January, to require thousands of able-bodied adults who receive benefits to work doing jobs like snow removal, street cleaning and park maintenance.

Webber Finds Way to Escape a Trap
News of Chris Webber's signing with the Golden State Warriors last night arrived just in time to quash the growing notion that for the second time in an otherwise first-rate basketball career, he appeared to have called an unfortunate timeout.
Just when he seemed to exorcise the one that cost Michigan a last shot at the 1993 national title, Webber was again trapped in a corner, fumbling for some way out of a spot that made him look driven by power and greed more than the desire to win.


Offer Made At Gypsum Concern
The National Gypsum Company's chairman, C. D. Spangler Jr., offered yesterday to buy the company for $940 million, or $43.50 a share.
But analysts ridiculed the price as far too low, and investors bid up the shares $12.0625, to $44.8125, in Nasdaq trading.
That price, however, represented a sharp increase from the $12.50 a share at which National Gypsum was valued 16 months ago, when the company emerged from bankruptcy protection.
At that time, the senior creditors and the company's management, since replaced, told other creditors, including asbestos claimants, that the company was not worth a penny more.


Norville Downie, 83, Collector of Beetles
Norville Morgan Downie, a former psychology professor whose lifelong hobby of collecting beetles resulted in an extensive contribution to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, died on Nov. 9 at the Home Hospital in Lafayette, Ind., where he lived.
He was 83.
He died of cancer, said his son, J. Paul Downie of Fort Wayne, Ind.

Indian Art Is Still Affordable
PRICES for American Indian art may have rocketed recently to stratospheric levels, but many creative items of excellent quality by artists old and new remain affordable in the well-stocked galleries in Santa Fe and Taos, N.M.
Santa Fe and the surrounding area have recently attracted the greatest concentration of dealers in old and new Indian artifacts of any place in the United States.
But well-priced works and even some bargains are found throughout the country, sometimes far from where specialized merchants congregate.


Whitman: A 'Natural' in Helping the G.O.P.; The Governor Looks Back, and Ahead, for New Jersey and for Her Party
Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman called John G. Rowland to congratulate him on winning the Connecticut governorship last week, but Mr.

"I know they're going to ask about the pensions, what about the pensions," Mr.
Rowland rattled into the phone to his fellow Republican in New Jersey.

Knicks And Davis Finally Find Their Shots
The Knicks gave their morale a lift tonight by giving the Los Angeles Lakers a whipping.
Snapping a two-game losing streak on the road, New York dominated the Lakers, 110-89, at the Forum.
The Knicks (4-2) led by as many as 26 points in the third quarter, giving the late-arriving crowd of 13,630 a reason to leave early.

Bulls' Coach Fined
Chicago Bulls Coach PHIL JACKSON, who called Referee HUE HOLLINS's performance in Saturday's game with the Dallas Mavericks "brutish" and "irresponsible," was fined $10,000 by the National Basketball Association yesterday.
Jackson's remarks came in the wake of Hollins's calls against SCOTTIE PIPPEN in the Bulls' 124-120 overtime loss to the Mavericks.
After a team practice in Chicago on Monday, Jackson said Hollins came into Saturday's game with an attitude problem.


Dismissal of Charges Is Urged For 3 in Chopper Shootdown
An Air Force judge recommended today that charges of dereliction of duty be dismissed against three radar plane officers implicated in the shooting down of two Army helicopters over northern Iraq last April.
The judge, acting as an investigator in the case, recommended that the charges stand against the senior director of the mission crew on the Awacs radar plane, Capt.
Jim Wang.
A fifth officer, Lieut.
Joseph Halcli, should receive administrative punishment, the investigator said.


Let the Democrats Act More Like Democrats; Clinton's Detractors
To the Editor:
Re "Dr. Fell's Election" (editorial, Nov. 10): I disagree that we cannot tell why people don't like Bill Clinton.
Obviously the attitude of the media, almost from his inauguration, has played an important role.


White House in Struggle To Take Back the Agenda
Inside an executive mansion fairly swarming with political advice-givers and abuzz with strategy, the burning question these days is not just what President Clinton will do with a Republican Congress, but what he will do with a Democratic White House.
It is also the toughest question.
And a week after Mr.
Clinton and his counsels lost command of the national legislature and any claim to a political mandate, they are still searching for an answer.


Fine-Tuning the Jeffries Case
The Supreme Court has called for more litigation in the Leonard Jeffries case, offering an opportunity to leap above past administrative squabbles and focus on the core issue: Can the City University of New York remove Professor Jeffries from his administrative post as chairman of the school's black studies department solely because of his racist speech?
Or would such a demotion violate his First Amendment rights to free speech?
Professor Jeffries had enjoyed his chairmanship for two decades when, in 1991, he delivered an off-campus speech denouncing "rich Jews" as slave traders and conspirators with the Mafia in Hollywood to defame African-Americans.
The university did not disturb the professor's tenure but it did take away his department chairmanship, a special credential.
He sued, persuading lower courts that even this sanction violated his constitutional rights, and the courts ordered him reinstated.


Report Urges Disposing of Plutonium by Encasing in Glass
With plutonium from military and civilian nuclear programs piling up and increasing the risk of bomb proliferation, a loose coalition of environmental groups suggested today that factories might be built to package it in huge blocks of glass, making it difficult to steal.
The idea was advanced in a report that even the author, Arjun Makhijani of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, said was incomplete and would probably require revisions.
But he and other proponents said that five years after the end of the cold war, policy makers seemed paralyzed by having to choose among unattractive options.


After a 55-year absence, Maxwell House coffee embraces the Times Square market again.
MORE than five decades after advertising for Maxwell House last overlooked Times Square, the coffee brand will drop back into the neighborhood.
General Foods USA, which markets Maxwell House, plans to unveil an extravagant neon billboard -- the type that makers of outdoor signs call spectaculars -- on New Year's Eve, during the hullabaloo greeting the arrival of 1995.
The ad will join others on the exterior of the Marriott Marquis Hotel on Broadway; it will be erected on the building's 46th Street side, around the corner from gaudy, glitzy billboards for Eastman Kodak and Hertz.


Essay; Get Off the Floor
At a recent lunch for Old Nixon Hands hosted by Len Garment, someone noted that the mood in our former stomping grounds was bleak; for days after the election, Bill Clinton had been sulking and brooding.
"Gee," piped up John Ehrlichman, "can you imagine working for a President who sits in the Oval Office brooding and sulking?"


Bond Prices Fall Despite Inflation Data
Despite an increase in the Consumer Price Index that was smaller than expected, the prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday for the first time this week.
The report on consumer prices, a closely followed measure of inflation, sent long-bond prices up a half- point in the morning, but persistent fears that inflation could still accelerate quickly turned those modest gains into sharp losses by midday.


Giuliani Back on Political Offensive After Setback
Momentarily chastened after losing his gamble in the race for governor, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is back on the political offensive, seeking to use George E. Pataki's refusal to call him to showcase himself as the champion of New York City.
The Mayor's new theme has emerged gradually, born out of Mr.
Pataki's decision to leave Mr.
Giuliani waiting at the phone like a spurned suitor, aides say, as well as from the Mayor's dislike of being humbled.
"He has a problem with meekness," said one adviser.


Keep Winning, Beard Says
Butch Beard is facing the same situation he was facing a week ago.
His team is coming off a key victory, but the Nets must follow up the task against the Washington Bullets at Byrne Meadowlands Arena tonight.
The Bullets beat the Nets in Landover, Md., on Friday night.
"We lose, it makes last night's game mean nothing," Beard said.
"We must see if we can come out with the same intensity."

A Little Dirt for Your Studio Loft?
SOHO is not only for artists; it's for gardeners, too.
Smith &amp; Hawken is coming to downtown on Nov. 25, with doorhandles made from a garden fork and spade (at left) and the smell of narcissus in the air.
"In New York, there's a great longing in any way, shape or form, for gardening, whether it's container gardening on a balcony, a fire escape, a front stoop or a small plot of land behind a town house," said Bonnie Dahan, the executive vice president of merchandising and design at Smith &amp; Hawken in Mill Valley, Calif.


Museum of Modern Art Ends Troubled Search for a Chief
The Museum of Modern Art announced yesterday that it had finally found a new director, after a sometimes messy 14-month search.
He is Glenn D. Lowry, the 40-year-old director of the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto and a specialist in Islamic art.
He takes over on July 1, 1995.
Mr.
Lowry is a surprise choice to succeed Richard E. Oldenburg, who announced in September 1993 that he planned to retire.
Since then, several candidates had turned down offers from the museum, and the names of many others had been bandied about.
Mr.
Lowry's was not one of them.


Traders Can't Shuffle Their Decks
A group of high-profile men gathered here this week to try to plot their separate courses for next year, but a large amount of their attention has been focused, figuratively at least, on coming events in Washington.
They're not politicians but general managers of major league baseball teams.
"Right now there's so much that people don't know," Terry Ryan of the Minnesota Twins said.
"You don't know what route you're headed. I'm sure we will not be getting the answers here. The people working in Washington with Mr. Usery will tell us."


Appeals Court Reinstates Pension Suit Against Crane
A Federal appeals court panel in St.
Louis has reinstated a lawsuit that accuses the Crane Company, a diversified industrial manufacturer, of deliberately dodging the pension obligations of a former subsidiary, the CF&amp;I Steel Corporation.
The lawsuit was filed nearly four years ago by Stanley D. Rabushka of St.
Louis under the False Claims Act, a Federal statute that permits citizens to file civil fraud cases on behalf of the Government and to share in any money recovered as a result of those cases.
A trial court judge in St.
Louis dismissed the case in June 1993, ruling that it was based solely on already public information and thus was barred under the terms of the False Claims Act.


Playing the Numbers Game, Ownership Style
In an extraordinary group rant yesterday morning, the National Hockey League's assembled general managers expressed the usual arguments in unusually strident tones.
They used sarcasm and anger to convey their frustration with the players union and portions of the news media who are skeptical when the 26 teams say they lost a total of $37.6 million last season.
Only a radically altered collective bargaining agreement, with restrictions on wages, can save the remainder of the already-damaged season and the future of the business, they said.
Soon, they may hold their collective breath until they turn blue, or they may huff and puff and blow the league down.


ARISTIDE DECIDES TO QUIT AS PRIEST
Bowing to pressure from the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy here and in Rome, Haiti's President, the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has agreed to leave the priesthood, Government officials and members of the clergy said today.
The decision culminates years of tension between Father Aristide and his superiors over his criticism of the Haitian church and his espousal of a leftist liberation theology.
Those strains, which grew when he governed as President in 1991, have resurfaced since he returned to office last month in the reversal of a military coup.


Caesar Nobiletti, 89, Real Estate Lawyer
Caesar Nobiletti, a New York real estate lawyer associated with a number of well-known building projects, died on Monday at St.

Ukraine Votes to Become a Nuclear-Free Country
The Ukrainian Parliament put aside its longstanding reservations and voted overwhelmingly today to make their nation nuclear-free, removing roadblocks to carrying out two major arms control agreements.
In a move that the United States eagerly sought for some time, the Parliament agreed to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which pledges its signers, with the exception of the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, to rid themselves of all nuclear weapons.


Big Headache: Meggett's Flu
Giants running back David Meggett was sent home from practice today because of a severe case of the flu.
Meggett's illness is just the first of a long list of ailing Giants.
It is unclear whether Meggett will miss the game on Monday against the Oilers in Houston, although it would probably take more than a flu bug to keep him from playing.
Still, he was in such bad shape today that he simply went home to rest and couldn't practice.


Market Place; A toy maker's improbable rise in stock price continues unabated.
HERE we go again.
The stock of a little toy company that makes impulse-buy toys -- the cheap ones near the checkout counter -- has taken off once more.
Its sales and profits are zooming upward, but nowhere near as rapidly as its stock.
Under whatever name, the company, now called EXX Inc., has been one of the more amazing performers of this or any other year.
In the third quarter of 1994, when it was called the SFM Corporation, its stock price zoomed 250 percent on the strength of stunningly good earnings it reported for the second quarter.


As Some Sob, Hasid Recalls Fateful Ride
The 18-year-old Hasidic student who was so badly injured by a gunshot wound to his head that his doctors at first did not expect him to survive hobbled into a courtroom yesterday and testified against the man the prosecution says shot him on the Brooklyn Bridge last March.
Some spectators sobbed as the student, Nachum Sasonkin, holding a cane in one hand, walked slowly into the courtroom in State Supreme Court in Manhattan where the defendant, Rashid Baz, is on trial for the shooting on the bridge.
One student was killed and three were wounded in the attack.

Israel Is Permitting Harsher Interrogation of Muslim Militants
A burst of attacks that killed nearly 30 Israelis in recent weeks has led the Government to permit harsher interrogations of suspected Muslim militants.
The loosening of past restrictions drew accusations today from a human rights group that the authorities had adopted the methods of their enemies.
Justice Minister David Libai said this week that a Cabinet committee on the Shin Bet security service had "taken a decision to strengthen the ability of the Shin Bet to deal with the wave of terror by Hamas and Islamic Holy War."


Heavy Rain Floods Florida's Winter Crops
Heavy rains from a tropical storm over the last two days have flooded tens of thousands of acres of farmland in Florida and destroyed a large part of its winter crop.
The storm, which has left at least 350 people dead in Haiti, according to radio reports, swept slowly across southern and central parts of Florida today before it moved into the Atlantic Ocean this evening.
Heavy rains subsided across much of the state as the storm, designated Tropical Storm Gordon, continued its northeastern course.


Exxon Leads Signers Of Indonesia Gas Deal
The Exxon Corporation and Pertamina, Indonesia's national oil company, have agreed to develop one of the largest offshore natural gas deposits in the world.
The project, which Exxon says will eventually require as much as $40 billion in investment, was announced here today as President Clinton turned to business issues on his last day in Indonesia, after the conclusion of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum here.


Medicaid Myths Linger In Wake of Campaign
CALL them the Medicaid Myths.
They were threaded through the New York governor's campaign.
They emerge every year in Albany at budget time.
They dominate the public debate about Medicaid.
And they are built on misunderstandings, confusion and a few politically useful distortions.
Since Medicaid accounts for about a fifth of the state's spending, Governor-elect George E. Pataki will have to cut it considerably to help to close the looming $4 billion budget gap, especially if he really does begin to lower taxes.

AT HOME WITH: David Mamet; Thoughts From A Man's Man
YOU may not think of David Mamet, the prolific author of angrified and angrifying plays and films, as an insecure fellow.
But there was a day not so long ago, he says, that in an agonizing fit of self-doubt, he sought out his wife, Rebecca Pidgeon, an actress and singer, and in a sort of desperate way, proclaimed his consuming love for her.
What, he asked, could have persuaded her to marry him, save him from himself, miserable wretch that he obviously was?
"She looked at me," Mr.
Mamet says, shifting his mimicry from his own earnest pleading to his wife's deadpan.
"And she said, 'Well, I don't know, you seemed like a nice guy.' "


Study of Death Wins A National Book Award
Choosing the least controversial book from among volumes that re-examined everything from the Tet offensive of the Vietnam War to the appointment of Justice Clarence M. Thomas to the Supreme Court, the National Book Award judges last night conferred the 1994 prize for nonfiction on "How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter" by Sherwin B. Nuland.
The book, published by Alfred A. Knopf, is a doctor's demythologizing of the fact of death.
It was chosen over four other books, including "Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas" (Houghton Mifflin), by Jill Abramson and Jane Mayer, which had been nominated before it was published last week.


A Musical on the Hopes of Youth And Disappointments of Adulthood
There's a lot of talk in "Three Postcards," the musical by Craig Lucas and Craig Carnelia at the Circle Repertory Company, about the elusiveness of reality.
One character, inspired by a magazine article about the mutability of subatomic particles, speculates, "Wouldn't it be incredible if all the secrets of the universe were aware when we started to get close to them, and they changed?"
Now, under this theory, it seems possible that once the lights go down on an evening's performance of this show, it turns into something else altogether: something richer, darker and more mysterious than what has been provided onstage.
As it is, audiences will have to make do with mild-mannered, minor variations on themes that Mr.
Lucas, the gifted author of "Reckless" and "Prelude to a Kiss," has explored with greater depth and imagination elsewhere.


CLINTON PLEDGES TO PUSH FOR VOTE ON TRADE ACCORD
President Clinton and a parade of the fallen and the survivors in Congress vowed today to plow ahead with House and Senate votes on a world trade agreement after Thanksgiving despite some bipartisan opposition.
They argued that if the votes were put off until next year, the agreement, which took 12 years to negotiate with 123 nations, would certainly die.


Echoes From All Over In the Songs of Basia
If there is such a thing as an international style of adult contemporary pop, the music of Basia comes as close as anything to embodying it.
A thirtysomething pop-jazz singer and songwriter from Poland, Basia has lived outside of London for the last 13 years and sings with an accent that is part British and part Eastern European.
Her music is a polished compendium of influences that range from the Brazilian bossa nova of Joao and Astrud Gilberto to the Motown anthems of Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson to the sleek pop-funk of Kool and the Gang.
This recipe, refined by Basia and her songwriting collaborator and producer, Danny White, also brings in jazz-fusion harmonies and brass, saxophone and electric keyboard solos.
At its best, it yields an all-purpose pop that is sophisticated and tuneful while also seeming second-hand and anonymous.

But addictions of any kind are defeating: they leave you frozen in place.
Isn't it time to get past the fulminations and examine why Mr.
Gingrich drives his adversaries particularly insane?
Not even the better-known right-wing Republicans panting to be President arouse the passions the Speaker-to-be does.

Washington Memo; G.O.P.'s Tax Cut Theory: Bonanza or Bust?
With a conviction that approaches religious fervor, many Republicans hold that certain kinds of tax cuts would significantly strengthen the economy.
People and companies would earn more money as a consequence, they say.
And the taxes paid on that additional income would offset the revenue lost from the lower tax rates, completely or at least in part.
In the budget lexicon, this is what is called dynamic scoring.


Fox Network Launching Challenge to PGA Tour
If it succeeds, the Fox television network's bold foray into the world of golf -- in essence a plan to underwrite and broadcast an eight-tournament, $25 million World Tour starting in 1995 -- could alter the balance of power in the sport and force the PGA Tour to significantly change its structure and the way it does business.
Plans for the new tour will be announced today at a news conference at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, Calif., site of Greg Norman's tournament, the Franklin Funds Shark Shootout.
What is known is that Fox has entered into a 10-year agreement with Executive Sports Inc., a management company based in Delray Beach, Fla., that already operates some 30 tournaments worldwide, and that Norman is one of the driving forces behind the World Tour concept.

Misplaced Fears About the Fed
The Federal Reserve's decision this week to raise interest rates in order to ward off inflation was, as expected, criticized from all corners.
Manufacturers warned that higher interest rates would drive up costs and drive away consumers.
Labor unions predicted layoffs.
Politicians feared disgruntled voters.
The Fed, these critics argued, ought not to slow down the economy when inflation is low, seven million Americans cannot find jobs and tens of millions more cannot find work that pays good wages.
Besides, they complained, driving up interest rates amounts to an unfair assault on vulnerable workers and an unseemly giveaway to rich bondholders.


Study Finds Cholesterol-Lowering Drug May Save Lives
For the first time, a study has found that lowering cholesterol not only reduces the risk of heart attack but also saves lives.
Until now, large studies of cholesterol-lowering drugs have shown that they can reduce deaths from heart attacks but not the overall death rate.
People who lowered their cholesterol levels with drugs died at higher rates of other causes, like cancer or violence or suicide.
The connection was a mystery, but the numbers sparked a bitter debate over whether cholesterol lowering was worthwhile.


Police Force In Greenport Is Off Duty For Good
The local police made their last patrols today in this rustic village of 2,100 people on Long Island's East End.
The people they had sworn to protect voted by almost 2 to 1 on Tuesday to throw them out of work, abolishing the troubled nine-officer department, which has been criticized as poorly trained, inactive and incompetent.
"It hurts," said Sgt.
Raymond E. Van Etten, the acting police chief, who was busy today collecting radios and other equipment.
"But it's a democracy. The people decided what was best for the village, and I support their decision."


Rikers Is Tense As Cuts Loom, And Official Warns of Crisis
With tensions smoldering among the 16,000 detainees in the Rikers Island prison complex, the chairman of the city's Board of Correction warned yesterday that the Giuliani administration's plan for further budget cuts of 1,300 prison guards and social workers was fostering conditions similar to those in 1990, when inmates rioted.
"The current Rikers situation could get that bad or worse," said William H. Booth, chairman of the nine-member independent board that monitors prison conditions and which itself would be eliminated under $31 million in new budget cuts being proposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.

"Dr. Fell's Election" (editorial, Nov. 10) proposes "the Fell Factor" ("I do not love thee, Dr. Fell. / The reason why I cannot tell . . .") as a convenient tag for the attitude toward President Clinton that voters evinced on Nov. 8.
You call such indistinct misgivings a phenomenon "first described three centuries ago by the poet Thomas Brown."


Man Shot Trying to Stop a Fight
A 34-year-old Brooklyn construction worker trying to end a fight between two pregnant women on a Bushwick sidewalk yesterday was critically wounded by a gunshot, the police said.
Witnesses said that the man, Deosaran Chatteran, was working at a construction site in the neighborhood about 11:45 A.M. when he saw the two women arguing in front of the building at 293 Jefferson Street, said a police spokeswoman, Detective Kim Royster.
The witnesses said that when the pregnant women started to grapple, Mr.
Chatteran tried to stop the fight.


Falcons Suspend Rison
The Atlanta Falcons suspended ANDRE RISON yesterday for one game, saying the wide receiver has repeatedly violated team rules.
Rison, a four-time Pro Bowl selection, is the team's second-leading receiver this year with 59 catches.
He had complained a week ago of being used too much as a decoy. (AP)


Government Coalition Collapses in Ireland
The two-year-old coalition Government of Prime Minister Albert Reynolds collapsed today, apparently forcing a general election before Christmas to select a new Parliament and Government.
Mr.
Reynolds had been striving to preserve his Government for five days, defending himself against charges of arrogance and deviousness made by his coalition partners in the Labor Party, which is led by Dick Spring.
Mr.
Reynolds had argued that a change of Government would impede efforts toward peace in Northern Ireland.

Not so coincidentally, the Turner effort is being coordinated with marketing strategies to sell Seuss books and new lines of clothing for children.
As it happens, the new Cat in the Hat Balloon in this year's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is sponsored by Random House in association with TNT and Esprit clothing.
All of which carries more than a whiff of paradox regarding a writer whose most famous tale, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," ended with the astute realization: "Maybe Christmas doesn't come from a store. Maybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more." But then Dr.
Seuss himself, really Theodor (Ted) S. Geisel, the son of immigrants from Germany -- Seuss was his mother's family name -- spent a good part of his professional life in advertising.
It was he who came up with the immortal (figured in ad years) line: "Quick, Henry, the Flit."

Giuliani's Endorsement
To the Editor:
Your Nov. 10 account of New York voter turnout states that on election night Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo's media adviser, David Garth, and I "suggested that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's endorsement of the Governor may well have backfired, allowing Mr. Pataki to rile upstate voters by casting the contest as an upstate-downstate struggle."


When the Window Is the Great View
IT'S no mystery why curtains are often compared with fashion.
A century ago, curtains were literally an interior decorator's version of a Worth gown -- ruched, furbelowed and spangled, built of countless yards of costly damask and layers of petticoats.
So it comes as no surprise that, as in fashion, curtains are available in couture and ready-to-wear varieties, some costing thousands of dollars, others little more than a double CD.


Teacher in Bronx Is Accused of Molesting Student
A Bronx junior high school gym teacher was arrested yesterday and charged with sexually abusing a 13-year-old student in his office, the police said.
The teacher, Leonard Quartararo, 53, of 1373 Bronx River Avenue in Hunts Point, grabbed the boy's crotch in the incident, which occurred Nov. 9, the police said.
Investigators said the teen-ager had gone to the office to protest an earlier incident in which Mr.
Quartararo had touched his buttocks.

Love and the Art Dealer: Never Too Late
WHEN Eugene V. Thaw first encountered American Indian art as a graduate student at Columbia University in 1948, "it was a nonevent," he said.
"I paid no attention to it."
These days, Mr.
Thaw and his wife, Clare, live here in what many people call the land of the first Americans, surrounded by the extraordinary objects of their most recent collecting interest: 600 surrealist Eskimo masks, geometric-patterned Pueblo pots, Rothko-like Navajo blankets and colorfully beaded Blackfoot shirts.


Thomson Will Buy Medstat for $339 Million
The Thomson Corporation, a Canadian company whose media empire includes The Globe and Mail in Toronto and American Banker, said yesterday that it would acquire a medical data provider for $339 million in cash.
Thomson will pay $27 a share for the Medstat Group of Ann Arbor, Mich., a developer of health care information data bases and related software.


Nyakizu Journal; And the Church Refuge Became a Killing Field
The lush, green rolling hills are lifeless.
Square, mud-wall houses are abandoned.
No one is working in the terraced fields.
The only sounds are the slight rustle of leaves and an occasional bird.
It is the silence of death.
Many of the former inhabitants were Tutsi, massacred in April.
Other now-empty houses belonged to the Hutu "killers," as one current resident, herself a Hutu, described them, or to the killers' relatives.
They have not dared come back.


General Employment
Shares of General Employment Enterprises Inc., a national employment agency based in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., jumped 41 percent yesterday on the American Stock Exchange.
The company posted a quarterly gain of 15 cents a share compared with a loss a year earlier.


Executive Changes
HARCOURT BRACE &amp; CO., Chestnut Hill, Mass., a unit of Harcourt General Inc., promoted Robert R. Simons, vice president and chief financial officer, to senior vice president.
NABISCO INC., Parsippany, N.J., named H. F. Powell executive vice president and chief financial officer.


Corrections
An article yesterday about the Jazz Times Convention in New York included a misstatement from the organizers about admission to an event tomorrow night at Fez, an East Village club, featuring Rodney Kendrick, Bhaki Mseleku, Mark Whitfield and Django Bates and Human Chain.
It is open to conventiongoers only, not to the public.


G.O.P. Military Overseer Assails Troop Readiness
Representative Floyd D. Spence, a South Carolina Republican in line to be chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has fired the opening shot in a new round of partisan battles over whether American troops are combat ready.
In a stinging letter to Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch on Tuesday, Mr.
Spence said that "U.S. military units are caught in the early stages of a downward readiness spiral that shows no prospect of easing in the foreseeable future."


Carjack-Killing Defendant Offers Alibi on the Stand
Edward L. Summers, the Bronx premedical student accused of stealing a Jeep in a suburban mall and killing its driver, took the stand in his own defense today and told how he had been terrorized into taking part in the crime by a shadowy figure named Dino who had once saved him from a street fight.
Mr.
Summers said he told Dino he did not know how to steal a car.
But Dino, he said, told him all he had to do was "show the gun," adding menacingly, "I didn't hesitate when those guys were going to" beat him last summer.


Corrections
Because of a mechanical error, the Personal Health column yesterday, about clinical trials of drugs, included an incomplete sentence.
It should have read, "The use of pla cebos is particularly important in trials of experimental drugs because about one-third of patients improve just because they are being studied."


Court Blocks New Rule on Immigration
Saying it raised serious Constitutional questions, a Federal judge today temporarily blocked California officials from enforcing the heart of Proposition 187, the much-debated immigration-control measure the state's voters overwhelmingly passed last week.
Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. of Federal District Court here found that the proposition, which would deny most government services to undocumented immigrants, might cause undue hardships and also might pre-empt law-enforcement powers reserved for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.


Keeping Score, One Pound at a Time
You see him driving the lane, his cargo jiggly, moving a little faster than you think might be safe speed, his heft, his girth, his width and height giving rise to the thought that a sign should be affixed to his bulging shirt: "Oversize Load."
This is John Williams -- all 300 pounds of him -- advancing to the basket, working out with the Indianapolis Pacers.
He is being given a chance, perhaps his last, to salvage what was once one of the most promising but gluttonous careers in the National Basketball Association.


New Major League Delays Start of Play Until '96
Major League Soccer, the league that was supposed to be the legacy of holding the World Cup in the United States last summer, is in a holding pattern of its own.
The kickoff has been put back one year.
Alan Rothenberg, the chairman of the league, who was also the chairman of World Cup USA, confirmed the long-expected delay in the league's start at a news conference in Manhattan yesterday.


Clinton Is Stern With Indonesia On Rights but Gleeful on Trade
The United States and Indonesia today announced $40 billion in joint projects over the next decade, even as President Clinton warned President Suharto that the relationship between the two countries would never reach its full potential unless he treated his people better.
At almost the same time that Mr.
Clinton was chiding the Indonesian leader for his country's inadequate human rights record, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown was witnessing the signing of 15 business deals that are part of the Administration's campaign of commercial diplomacy and will mean jobs for Americans.


A Mere Plaything, or a Goddess for Her Time?
FOREVER BARBIE The Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll  By M. G. Lord  Illustrated. 326 pages.
William Morrow &amp; Company. $25.
You might not think an 11 1/2-inch vinyl doll would be worth a 326-page book.
But as M. G. Lord, a former columnist and present book reviewer for Newsday, makes clear in "Forever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll," her subject inspires passion.


A Retiring Senator Sees Political Turmoil Ahead
Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma is one of dozens of Democrats leaving Congress.
In his case, however, the verdict came not from disgruntled voters, but from a disgruntled David L. Boren.
As he officially retires this week, with more than two years left in his Senate term, to become president of the University of Oklahoma, Mr.
Boren, a conservative Democrat, is already using his new academic perch to offer a bleak assessment of the prospects for two-party government in the nation's near future.
In fact, he predicts that Americans are likely to elect an independent Presidential candidate within a decade.

Mexican Economy Up 4.5%
In spite of continuing political shocks and disappointing corporate earnings, the Mexican economy managed to grow by 4.5 percent in the third quarter, surpassing even the Government's optimistic projections.
It marked the third straight quarter of growth, and Finance Ministry officials said this was the first economic recovery in 25 years not driven by greater Government spending.
Thus far in 1994, Mexico's economy has expanded 2.9 percent, the Finance Ministry said, leading analysts to predict that the year's growth will exceed the 3 percent the Government projected last year.


Corrections
Because of an editing error, an article in some editions yesterday about the National Book Awards misidentified the publisher of "A Frolic of His Own," by William Gaddis, the winner of this year's fiction prize.
It is Poseidon Press, a subsidiary of Simon &amp; Schuster, not Alfred A. Knopf.


Democrats Vow to Oppose Part of Gingrich's Agenda
Hitting back for the first time since their Election Day rout, Democrats said today that Newt Gingrich's conservative agenda for America smacked of political extremism, and a House Democratic leader declared that there would be no "rush to judgment" on the Republican proposals.
Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House Democratic whip, said the Republicans undoubtedly "have the votes to do what they want on many, many issues" next year.


INVESTIGATION OF CAREMARK IS SAID TO GROW
Expanding an investigation of kickbacks to doctors by home care companies, Federal officials have subpoenaed records from the Detroit area office of Caremark International, the nation's largest provider of intravenous drugs in patients' homes, people with knowledge of the case said yesterday.
They said investigators were examining bills submitted to the Medicaid program and Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Michigan, looking for overcharges and payments to physicians to recruit patients.
Kickbacks involving Medicaid and Medicare patients are illegal under Federal law.
Steve Mazur, a Caremark spokesman, said the Northbrook, Ill., company had "fully cooperated" in the three-year Federal investigation.
Caremark says its bills are legitimate.

For Census, Panel Urges A Sampling Of Unlisted
Jumping into what promises to be a lively debate over the shape of the next census, the National Academy of Sciences today called for the Census Bureau to use statistical sampling techniques to supplement its actual head count in the year 2000.
In a report issued today, a panel of experts, including economists and demographers, said that using sampling techniques to estimate the number of people missed would result in a more accurate and less costly census count.
In the 1990 census, field workers made as many as six visits to each of the nearly 35 million households that failed to return their census forms.


Leaves for Grass and Other Green Things


Common Sense Is the Goal at Talks
Though 10 more games were shaved off the schedule yesterday, reducing the 84-game regular season to 60 games, Day 48 of the National Hockey League lockout brought at least three positive developments.
One was the decision by negotiators to stay in Boston overnight and meet again today.
It was the first time since Oct. 4-5 that two consecutive days of bargaining have been scheduled.


Seagram Works For a Bright Holiday
Everyone hopes for a bright holiday season, but the Seagram Company is trying to do something about it -- commercially, anyway.
For its Chivas Regal brand of Scotch whisky, Seagram will run an extravagant print advertisement that lights up in the Dec. 12 issue of The New Yorker magazine.
The ad, which will appear in 300,000 copies of the issue, includes 23 tiny red light-emitting diodes that glow when a button is pressed.
It cost more than $1 million to produce and was created by Bronner Slosberg Humphrey in Boston, the Seagram direct marketing agency, and Intervisual Communications in Santa Monica, Calif.


Base Closings Said to Miss Revenue Goal
Nearly 90 percent of the military installations scheduled to be shut in the first two rounds of base closings remain in the hands of the Federal Government or state or local governments, a new General Accounting Office report says.
As a result, the report says, the revenue from pending and completed property sales from these base closings has amounted to only $92 million so far, well behind the pace needed to reach the $1.2 billion in total sales the Defense Department had estimated it would eventually receive.
The Government plans to use the proceeds to reduce the Federal deficit.


On Stage, and Off
Doing Fine, Thank You
The first winners of the fall season are in.
"You Should Be So Lucky," by Charles Busch, now at Primary Stages, will move on Dec. 8 to the upstairs theater at West Side Arts, last home to "First Night." That means the relatively tiny Primary Stages will be the only nonprofit company with two productions in open-ended runs.
It also produced David Ives's "All in the Timing."


Mr. Clinton's Strange Compromise
Clearly President Clinton is going to have to learn to compromise with his Republican opponents.
The Constitution, however, is the wrong place to start.
It was unnerving to hear Mr.
Clinton, at a news conference in Indonesia, announcing that he would consider working with the G.O.P. on an amendment permitting "voluntary" school prayer.
"I have always supported voluntary prayer in the schools," he said the other day.
He reserved judgment on specific language in a proposed amendment, and his aides have spun his remarks into a proposal for silent meditation that he never mentioned.
But Mr.
Clinton's concept of "voluntary" plays into the hands of groups that have tried for decades to tear down safeguards for religious freedom that the Supreme Court has vigorously defended.

An obituary on Wednesday about Elizabeth George Speare, an author of historical novels for children, misidentified an award received by her last book, "The Sign of the Beaver" (1983).

The association awarded its top honor, the Newbery Medal, to two of Mrs.
Speare's other books.


Art in Review
'Modernism: 1860-1960, A Century of Style and Design' and 'Art at the Armory'
Seventh Regiment Armory  Park Avenue at 67th Street  Through Sunday
In its annual appearance at the Seventh Regiment Armory, the art fair titled "Modernism" has been divided into two separate, related shows, one (titled "Modernism") devoted primarily to the decorative arts, the other ("Art at the Armory") to the fine arts, including painting, sculpture, drawing and photography.


Loan Arranged at Rockefeller Center
Rockefeller Center Properties, the public company that holds the $1.3 billion mortgage on Rockefeller Center, said yesterday that it had arranged to borrow $225 million, averting what had been a looming financial crisis.
The deal does not affect the company's more fundamental problem: that Rockefeller Center's owner, the Rockefeller Group, which is controlled by the Mitsubishi Estate Company of Japan, does not have enough money to make the payments on the mortgage and may default on the loan.

Refusing to Be a Face in a Crowd, Giuliani Won't Meet With Pataki
Governor-elect George E. Pataki, who refused to return Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's congratulatory phone call, asked the Mayor today to come to a meeting on Nov. 28 to discuss city issues -- but set off a new feud by scheduling the meeting on Staten Island and inviting nine other city officials as well.
The Mayor, according to his press secretary, Cristyne F. Lategano, will not attend.
"He doesn't think that that's the way to deal with city issues substantively," she said.


Federal Judges Propose Letting Cameras in Appellate Courts
The Federal judges who pulled the plug two months ago on an experiment with cameras in Federal courtrooms are having second thoughts.
It now appears likely that television will be invited into every Federal circuit court of appeals as soon as next year, not as a limited experiment, but on a permanent basis.
It is also possible that the experimental exploration of cameras in the Federal trial courts will be revived.
But this time, the experiments may test whether judges' concerns about the misleading nature of sound bites can be allayed by requiring the broadcast of at least a minute or 90 seconds of tape at one time.


Dostoyevsky's Life As a Departure Point
THE MASTER OF PETERSBURG
By J. M. Coetzee
250 pages. Viking. $21.95
In his 1987 novel, "Foe," the South African writer J. M. Coetzee reinvented Daniel Defoe's tale of Robinson Crusoe, giving us a post-modernist parable about the ever-shifting relationship between reality and art.
A similar undertaking informs Mr.
Coetzee's latest novel, "The Master of Petersburg," an allusive, elusive work that conflates "The Possessed," Dostoyevsky's dark tale about nihilism and revolution, with facts plucked from Dostoyevsky's own melodramatic life.


Don Schanche, 68; Newspaper Reporter And Book Author
Don A. Schanche, who wrote books on American radicals and adventurers and was the chief editor of Holiday magazine, died yesterday at his home in Key Biscayne, Fla.
He was 68.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Marybelle.


I.B.M. Plans To License Macintosh
Confirming longstanding computer industry speculation, I.B.M. said yesterday that it expected to license the Macintosh operating system from Apple Computer Inc. and install it on I.B.M. personal computers.
"Are we going to offer the Mac operating system preloaded on our machines? Yes, we are going to do that, assuming our customers want it," Roger Bolton, a spokesman for the International Business Machines Corporation, said in an interview.
Mr.
Bolton said I.B.M. would not modify the Macintosh system.


5 Babies at Center Ring In a Publicity Circus
Having reached something of a zenith with the O. J. Simpson trial, the media event, it should be remembered, was not born yesterday.
Sixty years ago, for instance, there were the Dionne quintuplets, only about two pounds each when they were born in May 1934 to a poor French Canadian family in rural Ontario.
Marketed as "The Five Little Wonders," they became an international phenomenon, which is recounted in "Million Dollar Babies," a two-part Canadian movie beginning Sunday and concluding Tuesday on CBS.
It is a riveting indictment of media cynicism and public gullibility.
On one side stand the parents.
Elzire Dionne (Celine Bonnier), only 25, is already the mother of five children.
Oliva Dionne (Roy Dupuis) is a simple farmer whose fumbling strategies will earn him the label of "avaricious peasant." On the other side is the Ontario provincial government, eager to protect a tourism treasure, and Allan Roy Dafoe (Beau Bridges), the seemingly humble country doctor who delivers the quints and then usurps them for his own profit.


NEW YORK POLICE FACE PATROL CUTS
The Giuliani administration acknowledged for the first time yesterday that the spending cuts it has proposed to close a $1.1 billion budget gap could force the Police Department to take hundreds of officers off patrol duties and put them into jobs now filled by civilians.
Police Commissioner William J. Bratton told a City Council committee that as many as 600 police officers could be shifted from patrol jobs to desk jobs under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan to keep the city's $31.6 billion budget in balance.

Pursuing the Sublime in Mahler
Here are comments by Times critics on their favorite recordings of Mahler's 10 symphonies and "Das Lied von der Erde" ("Song of the Earth").
Prices range from $8 to $17 for a single CD, $22 to $25 for a two-CD set and $33.98 for a three-CD set. (An introduction appears on page C1.) Symphony No. 9
Mahler's Ninth Symphony, the summit of the classical symphonic tradition, has inspired several major recordings.
In a Salzburg Festival performance preserved by Deutsche Grammophon, Herbert von Karajan had one of his finest hours with the Berlin Philharmonic, achieving a remarkable blend of lucidity and passion.
Jascha Horenstein's London performance on Music and Arts is furiously expressive, while Bernard Haitink's Concertgebouw version, part of a mid-price Philips box, lingers dreamily.
Bruno Walter's famous Ninth in Vienna, recorded on the eve of the Anschluss and reissued by EMI, cries from the heart.

SONY, STRUGGLING, TAKES A HUGE LOSS ON MOVIE STUDIOS
After months of optimistic statements, the Sony Corporation today became the latest Japanese company to acknowledge serious problems with a landmark American investment, announcing that it was taking $3.2 billion in losses on the value of the Hollywood studios that it acquired only five years ago.
In a surprise announcement, Sony said that because of poor box office results, a wave of executive resignations and rising costs, it could never hope to recover its investment in the studios, Columbia Pictures and Tristar Pictures, and was reducing their value on its books by $2.7 billion.


Pursuing the Sublime in Mahler
Here are comments by Times critics on their favorite recordings of Mahler's 10 symphonies and "Das Lied von der Erde" ("Song of the Earth").
Prices range from $8 to $17 for a single CD, $22 to $25 for a two-CD set and $33.98 for a three-CD set. (An introduction appears on page C1.) Symphony No. 7
An entirely satisfying recording has yet to be made of Mahler's sumptuous, byzantine Seventh Symphony, the least famous of his series and, for at least a few Mahler connoisseurs, the most weirdly enchanting.

Prices range from $8 to $17 for a single CD, $22 to $25 for a two-CD set and $33.98 for a three-CD set. (An introduction appears on page C1.) Symphony No. 2
Mahler's music has the uncanny power to make a critic feel neurotic and uncertain, even when choosing recordings to recommend.
The "Resurrection" Symphony, No. 2, was the first glorious sign of Mahler's musical excess, the result of a seven-year attempt to evoke the apocalypse in about 90 minutes of sound.
How could any recording of it have priority over any other when the best ones make it seem as if their gargantuan world were the only true one?

A British Novel-to-Be Sets a 2d Bidding Mark
Setting a record of $3.15 million for an advance for the North American publishing rights to a first novel, Dell Publishing outbid nine other publishers on Wednesday to acquire "The Horse Whisperer," a still-unfinished novel by a British writer.
It was the second time in a month that the work-in-progress by Nicholas Evans, a 44-year-old former print and broadcast journalist and screenwriter, set an industry record.


We Can't Treat Homelessness as Just a Housing Problem
To the Editor:
"Homeless Sleeping in City Office: Last Resort Is Now Part of System" (front page, Nov. 12) is a perfect example of why the public has become increasingly cynical about homelessness.
After more than a decade, family homelessness remains the most misunderstood issue in New York City.
And the most recent court-ordered response -- paying $100 a day to families for whom housing is not immediately available -- is ludicrous.


Hayes Move Reveals Modem Woes
When Dennis C. Hayes, the man whose name was long synonymous with computer modems, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for his company on Tuesday, he exposed not only the deep problems of Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc. but also the extraordinary pressures that afflict the industry itself.
The main problem for Mr.
Hayes is that in the modem market these days, a name does not mean all that much.

Sarajevo President's Office Attacked by Serbian Missiles
Nationalist Serbs attacked Bosnia's presidency building here with missiles today and bombarded a United Nations-designated "safe area" in northwestern Bosnia for the third day running.
Bosnian officials accused the United Nations military force of deliberately underreporting attacks by Serbs on the so-called safe area, around the Muslim town of Bihac.


Chalk Up Another Upset For Pierce
Mary Pierce doesn't consider herself a scalp collector, but last night at Madison Square Garden, she took up where she left off in 1993 and hunted down yet another competitor whose rank and reputation preceded hers.
Last year her victims were Martina Navratilova and Gabriela Sabatini.
Last night her prey was the world's No. 1 player, Steffi Graf, who succumbed, 6-4, 6-4, in the quarterfinals of the Virginia Slims Championships.

Deaths in 1979 Tied to Soviet Military
The worst known outbreak of anthrax, which occurred in 1979 in Sverdlovsk in the Urals and which became an international incident, has finally been proved to have originated from spores released from a Soviet biological warfare plant, a team of American and Russian scientists reported today.
The outbreak in the city infected at least 96 people and killed 66, in the official records, and may have killed more.


Sports of The Times; Is It Time For Smaller New League?
THE rumbling comes closer together now.
The world of sports is going through financial tremors unlike anything we have ever seen before -- strikes and shortfalls, power plays and dead seasons.
Where will it end?
Things happen on a daily basis now.
Baseball will never recover from canceling its 1994 season.
Hockey is destroying its once-promising future.
The owners in both sports cannot convince people they just might be telling the truth about the ledgers they will not display.


For Utilities, New Clean-Air Plan
Opening the door to a lower-cost method for reducing "greenhouse" gases that contribute to global warming, two big electric utilities have made a first-of-its-kind deal to trade air pollution allowances.
The agreement, scheduled to be announced today by Niagara Mohawk, serving upstate New York, and Arizona Public Service in Phoenix, is the first in which the right to emit one type of pollutant is being swapped for another.


Reeves: Inevitable Rumors Begin to Rattle
Dan Reeves says he is happy as the Giants' coach.
He has three years left on a five-year deal, and Reeves fully plans on honoring that contract -- unless.
The unless part is something Reeves got around to during a conversation this week, which may have been the toughest in his coaching life.
A snapshot of Reeves shows a coach who is still considered one of the best by his peers.
But the picture also shows a frustrated man who has been devastated by losing and disenchanted with how certain things are done in the organization.


Hilton Weighing a Sale; Stock Up
The stock of the Hilton Hotels Corporation jumped yesterday, breaking a long period of stagnation, after the company said it was considering selling itself or spinning off one or more of its businesses.
In a two-paragraph statement, the hotel and casino company said it had hired Smith Barney to study how the company might increase shareholder value through either a sale, a partial sale, a spinoff, a recapitalization, a merger or a repurchase of its shares.
A company spokesman, Marc Grossman, declined to explain the timing of the development or why the company was interested in any of the options it named.

Days and Nights of Murder, Madness and Mayhem
IF ever a city was made for black and white, it's New York.
The city is a place of harsh light, dark shadows, strong angles and violent extremes.
The New York fashion magazines may dictate pastels or flaming reds to the rest of the nation.
In downtown Manhattan, it's all black clothes and pale skin.
The skyline itself, the city's most durable, seductive image, achieves full power, Lucifer-like, as darkness descends and a million cold white diamonds begin to glitter.
New York is a noir city.
It's no surprise to find that the Film Forum in the South Village has assembled more than 60 films (nearly all of them in black and white) in its series "NYC Noir," which begins today.
The city's uncompromising landscape and the endless surge of its anonymous crowds make an ideal setting for pitiless moral dramas in which doomed characters move inexorably toward a violent end.
In the classic New York noirs, the city's skyscrapers and streets simultaneously play the role of the gods and the chorus in Greek tragedy.
They are the impassive observers, the iron enforcers, of a bleak moral code.


Moderate Democrats' Poll Sends the President a Warning
An organization of moderate Democrats that helped Bill Clinton get his Presidential bid off the ground put him on notice today that he had better shift to the right or risk losing re-election in 1996.
The group, the Democratic Leadership Council, made public a new poll that showed -- as did exit polls last week -- that support for Democrats had collapsed among independent voters and that Mr.
Clinton needed to win them back if he was to recover.


World Tour Steps Up To First Tee vs. PGA
Oozing the same Aussie bravado and cocksure bearing that he brings to the golf course, Greg Norman took to the dais here today to assure the world that the proposed World Tour is no longer a proposal, but a reality.
Undaunted by a cool reception to the idea from some top American players on the PGA Tour, and despite the fact that specific sponsors, sites and players have yet to be named, Norman proclaimed that the eight-tournament, $25 million series with fields of the top 30 players in the world would begin in 1995 at sites in the United States, Canada, Scotland, Spain and Japan.


Jailed German Terrorist Wins Court Ruling
A German court ruled today that a member of the far-left Red Army Faction terrorist group, convicted of taking part in a 1972 bombing that killed three American soldiers, should be released after 22 years in prison.
The convict, Irmgard Moller, 47, has been serving a life sentence for her role in the bombing, which took place at a United States military post in Heidelberg.
A panel of judges in Lubeck, where Miss Moller has been imprisoned since 1980, ruled that she fulfilled legal stipulations permitting the early parole of long-term prisoners when no danger exists that they will return to crime.

Ex-Coach Is Indicted
A Federal grand jury in Waco, Tex., yesterday indicted the dismissed Baylor coach, DARREL JOHNSON, three former assistants and four others on mail and wire fraud charges.
The indictments come one day after Johnson was discharged by school administrators who determined that the men's basketball program had broken university and National Collegiate Athletic Association violations.


The Search for Knowledge In the Suffragists' Footsteps
Imagining Eve in the Garden of Eden, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the founding genius of the women's rights movement, offered memorable sarcasm a century ago in observing that, of course, Eve ate that apple, the better to satisfy "that intense thirst for knowledge that the simple pleasures of picking flowers and talking to Adam could not satisfy."
This thirst for knowledge goes forward with some of the same acerbic dedication at the new Women's Rights National Historical Park here in Stanton's picturesque hometown.
The acting superintendent of the park, Laura Rotegard, is about to realize one of her wish-list projects with the resurrection of the pioneer newspaper of the women's movement, The Lily, right here on Fall Street.

Kiki Smith  'Drawings'
Pace Wildenstein  32 East 57th Street  Through Nov. 26
For her debut at Pace Wildenstein, Kiki Smith has produced a nervous and unfocused show, but one that still manages to distill the flavor of her idiosyncratic sensibility.
It is titled "Drawings," though the work includes prints, reliefs, collages and sculptures, all done in or on paper and mostly in black and white with occasional touches of color.


A War of Signs Goes Skyward; Parking Warnings Raised To Help Ward Off Thefts
In the war over New York City's precious supply of parking spaces, some of the most intense fighting occurs over No Parking signs.
The city puts them up, and drivers, ever desperate for a spot, pull them down.
The late-night thievery has driven transportation officials and local merchants to distraction -- and desperate measures.
"I'm not kidding when I say we've had signs put up and torn down by the next day, just when you're not looking," said William L. Haines, the president of a real estate company that owns several commercial buildings along Fifth Avenue near 17th Street.
"The signs are put back up, and a week later they're gone again. People just shinny up the pole and take them down. They're shameless."

RESULTS PLUS
N.B.A.
Rockets Pound Bulls  Hakeem Olajuwon's 29 points and Kenny Smith's 3-point shooting led Houston to a 106-83 victory over the visiting Chicago Bulls last night, extending the Rockets' season-opening winning streak to eight.
The Rockets also have a 22-game November winning streak over the last two seasons.
They were 14-0 a year ago in November when they won their first 15 games, tying a National Basketball Association record.
They are 8-0 this year.
Olajuwon dominated the inside from start to finish, and Smith, who finished with 19 points, was 4 of 6 on 3-point shots, including 2 in an early fourth-quarter run when the Rockets took command. (AP) Mavericks 96, Kings 94: Mavericks forward Roy Tarpley had 16 points and 9 rebounds in his return to the N.B.A., and Lucious Harris's 8-foot bank shot with 59 seconds remaining gave Dallas a 96-94 victory over visiting Sacramento.
Tarpley played in his first N.B.A. game since he was dismissed by the league for violating its anti-drug regulations Oct. 16, 1991.
Tarpley was activated from the injured list on Wednesday after missing the season's first five games with bursitis in his left knee. (AP)


Lessons From a Tragedy
A report by the New York City school system's special investigator concludes that officials who took 138 students to an amusement park in June, where 14-year-old Daniel Maracallo drowned, ignored existing rules and could have benefited from some additional ones.
Good enough.
But even more striking than the lack of attention to rules is the appalling lack of basic human judgment that might have prevented this tragic incident.
On June 15, eighth-grade students at Intermediate School 166 in the Bronx went to Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown, Pa., for their graduation trip.
Five teachers and one assistant principal accompanied the students on three buses.
One of the most popular attractions at the park is a "wave pool," which has machinery at its deep end to create powerful waves at a fast rate.

WESTERN ACCEPTS SWEETENED OFFER BY BJ SERVICES
The BJ Services Company, a supplier of pressure pumping services to the oil and gas industry, said yesterday that the Western Company of North America had accepted a sweetened merger offer valued at $500 million.
Western, which also services oil and gas producers, agreed to a deal in which each shareholder would receive $20 a share: 50 percent in cash and 50 percent in BJ Services stock, plus a five-year warrant for every five BJ Services shares to buy BJ Services stock at $30 a share.
In August, Western spurned a cash and stock offer of $18.50 a share that did not include a warrant.
Both companies are based in Houston.
BJ expects to take a $40 million restructuring charge in the first quarter after the merger.

A change in the timing of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Company's proposed $2 billion exchange of its RJR Nabisco stock for Borden Inc. is prompting investors to speculate that the Securities and Exchange Commission is concerned about the price that Borden shareholders might receive.
According to an amended exchange statement filed by RJR Nabisco with the S.E.C. on Wednesday evening, shareholders and arbitragers will know the exchange price at least 10 days before the expiration of the offer, enabling them to calculate exactly how many shares of RJR Nabisco they will receive for Borden shares.

Bishops Assail Rule Hostile To Immigrants
The National Conference of Catholic Bishops urged today that greater emphasis be placed on Federal immigration policies rather than relying on punitive local measures like Proposition 187 in California, which denies illegal immigrants nonemergency medical, educational and social services.
In a statement issued on the final day of their annual fall meeting, the bishops said the taxpayer frustration that fueled passage of Proposition 187 established an intimidating tone that could foster "harassment of persons who may look or sound 'undocumented.' " What was needed, they said, was a rational discussion of Federal policies that regulate legal entry into the United States.


For Children
Wall-Climbing Classes
North Meadow Recreation Center  Midpark, at 97th Street; reachable from Central Park West and Fifth Avenue entrance  Central Park  (212) 348-4867  Recommended ages: 8 and up
Thirteen members of Girl Scout Troop No. 3005 from the Upper West Side of Manhattan were strapped into their harnesses and about to climb an outdoor 25-foot wall at a recent Central Park Outward Bound climbing class.
The harnesses around their waists and hips made the third and fourth graders feel ridiculous.
But the straps were attached to a rope, or belay, held by the class's two teachers as the girls climbed.
Without that, the girls would really have known what fear felt like.

Odor of Burning Interrupts 'Rigoletto'
A performance of "Rigoletto" at the Metropolitan Opera on Wednesday evening was interrupted when a projector on a lighting bridge over the stage overheated, sending fumes through the house.
The problem began just after the second intermission, when some patrons detected a faint burning odor.
As the third act continued, however, the odor grew stronger, and by 10:43, just after Sumi Jo, Paolo Gavanelli, Ramon Vargas and Birgitta Svenden sang the work's famous quartet, "Bella figlia dell'amore," audience members began leaving the hall.
Christian Badea, the conductor, stopped the orchestra, the house lights were raised, and the Met announced that it was investigating.

Pursuing the Sublime in Mahler
Here are comments by Times critics on their favorite recordings of Mahler's 10 symphonies and "Das Lied von der Erde" ("Song of the Earth").
Prices range from $8 to $17 for a single CD, $22 to $25 for a two-CD set and $33.98 for a three-CD set. (An introduction appears on page C1.) Symphony No. 1
The conductor Eliahu Inbal has written that he regards Mahler's symphonic output as "a single great novel with 11 chapters, consisting of the 10 symphonies and 'Das Lied von der Erde.' " To the limited extent that the cycle can indeed be seen as a huge novel in sound, the First Symphony is the chapter that brings listeners up to speed on the hero's world.
It draws on Mahler's earlier "Songs of a Wayfarer" and "Klagende Lied," and its rustic borrowings set the scene in broader ways.
Mahler himself was unsure what to make of it, terming it a tone poem at its premiere, in 1889; calling it "Titan" and adding descriptive movement titles in 1893; then discarding the titles (and the second movement, "Blumine") and presenting the work as a symphony in 1896.

Pursuing the Sublime in Mahler
Here are comments by Times critics on their favorite recordings of Mahler's 10 symphonies and "Das Lied von der Erde" ("Song of the Earth").
Prices range from $8 to $17 for a single CD, $22 to $25 for a two-CD set and $33.98 for a three-CD set. (An introduction appears on page C1.) Symphony No. 8
In a symphonic cycle in which every gesture is larger than life, Mahler's No. 8, the "Symphony of a Thousand," is far and away the most grandiose installment (although the Ninth has greater emotional impact).
Conventional symphonic movements give way to two extended parts, drawing on very different texts: "Veni, Creator Spiritus," a medieval hymn celebrating the Holy Spirit, and the final scene of Goethe's "Faust," which describes divine love as a protecting force.
To convey all this, Mahler uses an expanded orchestra, a huge chorus and eight vocal soloists.


Look Before You Park


Sexism and Rothbart As Obstacles to Love
An arrogant French frog named Jean-Bob (whose voice belongs to John Cleese) is convinced that one kiss from the beautiful Princess Odette will turn him into a handsome prince.
Stranger acts of magic have happened, and "The Swan Princess" is one of them.
Loosely based on the legend that inspired "Swan Lake," and blatantly borrowing the formula of Disney's "Beauty and the Beast," this animated musical turns out to be funny and enchanting on its own.
Directed by Richard Rich, who started an animation company after 14 years at Disney, "The Swan Princess" makes first-rate copying seem like a good idea.
The film begins shamelessly, with a Disney-looking castle in the background and the words "Once upon a time there was a king named William." This is a movie that luxuriates in its classic fairy-tale style, with a few updated twists.

Searchers after completeness will want this last symphony whole, even when the gaps and loose ends Mahler left behind have been filled and tied up by others.
Instinct more than scholarship moves me to forget what is unfinished and stay with the completed Adagio.
It is a last great earthly sigh of human hope and unfulfillment.
God, Mahler's ultimate editor, seems to have decreed it so.

He May Be a Killer, But He's Such a Sweetie
As the first American big-studio film about a man who dearly loves his houseplant, "The Professional" is bound to raise eyebrows.
And raise them on both sides of the Atlantic, since this is the work of the film world's most attention-getting man without a country, Luc Besson.
In "La Femme Nikita," Mr.
Besson stylishly melded American luridness with Gallic sophistication, though the violence level was enough to dismay French audiences and prompt a coarse American remake ("Point of No Return").
Emboldened by the success of that hybrid, Mr.
Besson has now made a film in New York, featuring characters who speak like Americans, think like Frenchmen and behave appallingly in any language.
"The Professional" lacks the sexy elan of "La Femme Nikita" and suffers from infinitely worse culture shock.

"To Live" was shown as part of this year's New York Film Festival.

In the gambling house where Fugui (Ge You) spends his nights, letting his family fortune slip from his grasp, he is treated like a young prince.
The setting is China in the pre-revolutionary 1940's, and after hours of gambling, Fugui is carried home at dawn through the streets of his small town on the back of a man who deposits him at his extravagant house.
Fugui's wife, Jiazhen (Gong Li), begs him to stop gambling, for the sake of their small daughter and the child she is carrying.

French Left Gets a Lift From Right
Only weeks ago, French conservatives seemed certain to win next spring's presidential elections.
Now, in a turnaround that could cheer American Democrats after their drubbing last week in mid-term elections, France's Socialists again have a chance.
Strangely, the Socialists themselves did little to achieve this.
Rather, in what might also sound a warning to American Republicans, the Socialists have bounced back because French voters are now beginning to blame the right for what is wrong with France.


Diner's Journal
A Touch of Austria
Not so long ago New York City had dozens of restaurants like Lipizzana.
Courtly waiters described specials like saddle of venison with red cabbage, bread dumplings and lingonberries, or pheasant consomme with truffle shavings and duck-liver dumplings, "the lightest imaginable," in mouth-watering detail.
Alas, times have changed and Austrian restaurants are scarce.
That must be why Lipizzana is filled most nights with people who look around them with a very proprietary air.
At one table a woman called Elsie is being loudly serenaded by a group of young people on her 80th birthday; at another, three carefully dressed white-haired women discuss the menu in slow and elegant French.
They consider the Viennese goulash served with a fried egg, weisswurst and spatzle.
They discuss the merits of grilled salmon with braised cabbage.
In the end, however, they all choose the same thing: Wiener schnitzel.
It arrives just as a large man with spectacular wattles and a tiny woman dressed in an ornately embroidered Chinese jacket are inching their way to the neighboring table.
The pair examine the schnitzels with interest and decide that they, too, will order the veal.

Market Place; Truly glum days at Spectrum, where executives fear to tread.
JOBS may be hard to come by in some quarters, but at Spectrum Information Technologies, even the top spots are going begging.
Spectrum, a wireless-cable company in Manhasset, L.I., could be announcing its earnings for the fiscal second quarter ending Sept. 30 as early as today.
And its investors could use some relief: Shares of the troubled company have traded in a lifeless range of 311/16 down to 17/16 since mid-February.


Pursuing the Sublime in Mahler
Here are comments by Times critics on their favorite recordings of Mahler's 10 symphonies and "Das Lied von der Erde" ("Song of the Earth").
Prices range from $8 to $17 for a single CD, $22 to $25 for a two-CD set and $33.98 for a three-CD set. (An introduction appears on page C1.) Symphony No. 5
An unusual number of excellent Mahler performances have been recorded in concert.
More is at stake in public than in private, with no opportunity to turn back, no temptation to rationalize, refine or second-guess.
This symphony in particular, lacking an explicit program, should unfold as if it were a grand interior monologue spontaneously produced by conductor and orchestra, a live event that cannot be replicated.


Sony Electronics Review Is Narrowed
The Sony Electronics unit of the Sony Corporation of America named five finalists yesterday to compete in the review for its estimated $50 million account.
Most of the account had been handled from May 1991 until September by the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, which resigned rather than participate in the review.
Rick Clancy, a spokesman for Sony Electronics in Park Ridge, N.J., identified the finalists as Foote, Cone &amp; Belding in San Francisco and the New York offices of four agencies: Chiat/Day, DDB Needham, Lowe &amp; Partners/SMS and Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro RSCG.

Mahler hated to say goodbye.
A composer of infinitely extended farewells, he was a great man in search of an editor.
The Fourth Symphony, an anomaly, is relatively succinct, filled with sunlight, even sweetness.

WHITE HOUSE TRIES TO CLARIFY STAND ON SCHOOL PRAYER
White House officials today sought to clarify President Clinton's position on school prayer but instead sent mixed signals that only intensified complaints among some Democrats that the President was too prone to shifting his positions.
The issue arose on Tuesday, when Mr.
Clinton said he would not rule out backing a constitutional amendment on prayer that Republican leaders said they would pursue.
But stung by attacks from Democrats and civil liberties groups, who denounced the President's remarks as an "instant cave-in," White House officials today sought to recast the President's position.

A Time for War, and a Time for Play


Owners Offer A Tax System Or Stricter Cap
Major league baseball owners made an expected move today when they presented a new proposal to the striking players based on a tax system on team payrolls.
The owners also made a shrewd and logical new move, revising but not withdrawing the salary cap proposal they've stood fast by for five months, making it more possible to implement if they so desire.
The owners, still holding the cap as a kind of stick to the tax "carrot," are believed to have made the cap less palatable for the players and more feasible for themselves by doing away with the $1 billion-a-year guarantee for players' salaries that had previously accompanied it.
They also reportedly fixed the costs of salaries on first- through four-year players in lieu of salary arbitration.


Mexican Party Is Accused in Assassination
In one of the worst political scandals of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's last year in office, a top law enforcement official has publicly accused Mexico's governing party of hindering the investigation into the killing of the party's secretary general in September.
Party leaders have lashed back at the official, Mario Ruiz Massieu, the Deputy Attorney General, accusing him of conducting a witch hunt that has implicated without proof many top-ranking members of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, which has governed for 65 years.


A New Movie Multiplex Near Lincoln Center
New York has a new showplace: the Sony Theaters Lincoln Square complex in Manhattan, opening today and setting a new standard for the multiplex movie house.
From computerized ticket machines in the ground-floor lobby to the wonders of an 80-by-100-foot IMAX screen upstairs, this new complex boasts impressive wonders of the high-tech world.
Yet its theater design is also gratifyingly nostalgic, a welcome homage to the grand Loews movie palaces of the past.
Among the nine regular theaters opening today (there will eventually be 12), foremost is a 900-seat space with a luxuriously retro look: proscenium arch, red-and-gold color scheme, a frieze featuring a line of elephants and a large gold curtain.
Outside, the lobby is sleekly efficient, but its decorative palm trees summon memories of movie exhibition's glory days.
Theaters opening off this lobby have playfully framed doorways with Hollywood-international motifs (Chinese, Egyptian, etc.) and bear great, familiar names: Paradise, State, Capitol and Avalon are among them.
Sony's acquisition of the Loews chain has taken the form of a charming tribute.

Wisconsin's Moss Gets Two Years' Probation
Wisconsin tailback BRENT MOSS, the most valuable player in the 1994 Rose Bowl game, pleaded guilty yesterday in Madison, Wis., to a charge of misdemeanor possession of cocaine and was placed on two years' probation.
GERRICK B. HAWKINS, who was arrested Nov. 9 with Moss, also pleaded guilty to possession and was given the same sentence by Dane County Circuit Judge JACK AULIK.
The judge told Moss that he was not getting preferential treatment and that the two cases were similar to 95 percent of the drug actions in the county's court system.
Moss and Hawkins were fined $250 and were told they could work it off in community service at a rate of $10 an hour.

He told The Associated Press in a telephone interview yesterday: "I'm going to fight again. I want to be the fifth man to regain the heavyweight title."


At the Bar; For Clinton, the Supreme Court's docket is a mine field of politically sensitive cases.
The House of Representatives and the Senate are not the only institutions in town in a position to give the Clinton Administration a major headache in the post-election era.
The Administration's remarkable about-face in a recent child pornography case before the Supreme Court underscored yet another unpleasant new fact of life: how perilous the Court's docket has become for the White House.
The docket is a virtual mine field of politically unpalatable cases waiting to explode as the Administration files briefs and argues its positions on subjects like minority set-asides in Federal contracting, school desegregation and state limitations on welfare benefits.

U.S. to Offer Housing Vouchers To Lure Homeless From the Subways
In an effort to move hundreds of homeless New Yorkers out of the subway system, where they live in rat-infested utility rooms and narrow passageways between tracks, the Federal Government announced yesterday that they would be offered Federal housing vouchers.
Under a pilot program to begin immediately, seven local nonprofit agencies will be given a total of 250 vouchers to distribute to the homeless, who are often too fearful to go to the city's shelters.
Transit police estimate that as many as 1,500 people live in the subway's underground tunnels.

2 Parallel Renaissance Trajectories
Why mince words?
"Painting and Illumination in Early Renaissance Florence: 1300-1450," which opens today at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is a quiet exhibition that simply has it all: spectacular and little-studied material, fresh art historical perspectives, and as careful and loving a presentation as one could hope for.
The real wonder is that the show's subject has not been dealt with in depth before.
As Florentine panel and fresco painting of the 14th and early 15th centuries was paving the way for the classical Renaissance moment, illuminated manuscript production was also in full swing, turning out extraordinary liturgical and devotional books.
Such books have been given comparatively little scholarly attention, and it is seldom acknowledged that many of the period's most ambitious and versatile painters were also illuminators, developing some of their most inventive ideas in miniature form.


Irish Premier Quits in Split Of Coalition
Abandoned by his Labor Party partners in Government, Albert Reynolds resigned today as Prime Minister.
But in a move designed to keep his Fianna Fail party in power, Mr.
Reynolds did not ask President Mary Robinson to dissolve Parliament, and this left Irish politics in turmoil.
Mr.
Reynolds ended the 22-month coalition with Labor after Labor's leader, Dick Spring, refused to support him in a vote of confidence.
Mr.
Spring had attacked Mr.
Reynolds over his handling of a much-publicized case involving extradition of a Roman Catholic priest accused, and later convicted in Northern Ireland, of child molesting.
Together, the two parties, with 99 seats, had controlled the 166-member Parliament with the largest majority, 37 votes, in the 74-year history of the state.

While Leonardo da Vinci remains one of history's most intriguing individuals, his "backward" handwriting should not continue to be a puzzle.
You repeat traditional lore in writing that Leonardo's "handwriting is backward because the artist, who was left-handed and loved optical tricks, wrote from right to left using a mirror, apparently to help disguise his theories."

Absurdist Spoof of Nazism
If a Keystone Kops film were written by William S. Burroughs, peopled with characters from George Grosz by way of Russ Meyer and directed in a style that suggests Jean-Luc Godard on speed, you would have a movie with the style and mood of "Terror 2000."
This slam-bang comedy lampooning neo-Nazism and xenophobia in contemporary Germany wallows in ridiculously fake gore and grotesque sexual couplings.
The director Christoph Schlingensief's idea of how to film a shooting is to show a gun aimed at someone's face and a moment later to have that face doused with a bucket of entrails.

Bonds initially made modest gains on the housing report, but the potential for gains was limited as a survey by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve of general business conditions in its region showed continued strength in economic growth.


Pursuing the Sublime in Mahler
Here are comments by Times critics on their favorite recordings of Mahler's 10 symphonies and "Das Lied von der Erde" ("Song of the Earth").
Prices range from $8 to $17 for a single CD, $22 to $25 for a two-CD set and $33.98 for a three-CD set. (An introduction appears on page C1.) Symphony No. 6
Although teeming with inescapable portents, Mahler's Sixth Symphony, often called "Tragic," is among his most straightforward creations formally.
Taut and terse for all its 80 minutes or so, it is essentially a huge Classical symphony, just an eventful century removed from Haydn.
As such, it lends itself well to abstraction and can have the greatest impact in a reading that is animated, steady, clear-eyed and cool verging on white hot.

Ms.

Pursuing The Sublime in Mahler
YES, Gustav Mahler predicted that his time would come, and yes, it did.
But what happens next?
It is unlikely, now that his symphonies have been plumbed to their astounding depths and widely acknowledged as epochal landmarks, that his standing will ebb and flow on the tide of opinion the way, say, Sibelius's and Rachmaninoff's always seem to do.
But it can feel at times that the quantity of Mahler performances and recordings stands in a problematic, if not necessarily inverse, relationship to quality.
The specialness of performances led by Leonard Bernstein in the nascent Mahler boom of the 1960's, let alone earlier ones by the likes of Bruno Walter and Dmitri Mitropoulos, is an increasingly dim memory.
Mahler taken for granted is simply not Mahler.


Seoul Journal; A Crisis of Faith: Is the New Korea Jerry-Built?
As part of his response to the collapse of a major commuter bridge in October, President Kim Young Sam took Korean reporters to a remote spot behind his official residence and showed them that the large stone statue of Buddha was still there.
President Kim offered the tour to dispel the rumor that he, a Presbyterian, had removed the statue from the presidential garden and was therefore somehow responsible for the collapse of the Songsu Bridge, as well as for the boat accidents, train derailments and air crashes that seem to have afflicted this nation all at once.

Critic's Choice/Film; Calling All Fans of the BBC
You've seen Ralph Fiennes as a Nazi commandant in "Schindler's List" and as a patrician intellectual in "Quiz Show," but you haven't seen him in what may have been a bigger acting challenge: playing a love scene with a bird.
He does that in "The Cormorant," a recent film made for the BBC.
It will be shown at the Joseph Papp Public Theater on Dec. 2, 3 and 4 as part of a series that opens today, "Against the Odds: BBC Drama, 1975-1994."
Mr.
Fiennes plays a writer who inherits a cormorant, a gull-like bird that seems to have a malevolent personality.
The underlying sense of evil never materializes fully, but the film is worth seeing for Mr.
Fiennes, who looks great, is convincingly smitten with his malicious bird and even has a brief comic scene in a bubble bath with his son's Donald Duck toy.

What Do You Say, Virginia?
You could build a good case for remaking "Miracle on 34th Street." Though the 1947 original remains as charming as ever, the story seems perfect for the 90's.
There is the divorced mother (Maureen O'Hara in the original), the daughter who doesn't believe in Santa (the very young Natalie Wood) and a Macy's Santa (Edmund Gwenn) who insists he is the real Kriss Kringle and proves it in court.
He restores the child's faith in magic and even sends shoppers down the street to Gimbel's, ideas that seem ripe for a time when Christmas has become dizzyingly commercial and many children are in nontraditional families.
Well, the perfect Santa movie for children of divorce has arrived, but it turned up last week as "The Santa Clause," starring Tim Allen.
The new "Miracle on 34th Street," produced by John Hughes (the mastermind behind shrewd hits like "Home Alone") and written by him with George Seaton, is a dull project that makes only cosmetic changes in the original.
It loses the warmth and nostalgia of the old movie, but is too timid to give the story the sharp, contemporary spin it needs.


Gay Worker Accuses Male Of Harassing Him Sexually
In an unusual twist to a common workplace problem, a gay employee of a Philadelphia restaurant has complained to a state agency that his male boss sexually harassed him.

Another recent film-game pairing was "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," with the Sega CD arriving along with the movie on Nov. 4.


U.S. Proposes Exclusion Zone In Bosnia Town
Concerned by the Serbian advance on Bihac in northern Bosnia, the United States is proposing that a weapons exclusion zone be established around the embattled town, Administration officials said today.
The United Nations force in Bosnia has already outlined a "safe area" around Bihac that is supposed to be free from attack.
But British officials have been skeptical of the idea, adding new strains within NATO at a time when the allies are still smarting over the American decision not to enforce an arms embargo in the region.

They Said She Was D.O.A., But Then the Body Bag Moved
The old woman was sprawled on her living room floor, cold and motionless, and the apartment manager who found her on Wednesday was sure she was gone.
Paramedics and the Albany County Coroner, Philip Furie, found no heartbeat, no pulse, no breath or other signs of life, and the coroner declared her officially dead.
They zipped Mildred C. Clarke, 86, into a body bag, took her to the morgue at the Albany Medical Center Hospital and left her in a room where corpses are kept at 40 degrees, pending autopsies or funerals.
About 90 minutes later, the chief morgue attendant went in to transfer her to a funeral home.

Sign Him, Trade Him: Webber Becomes Bullet
Completing a major deal forced by a conflict between a player and a coach, the Golden State Warriors traded their unhappy star forward Chris Webber to the Washington Bullets today.
In exchange, they received the third-year forward Tom Gugliotta and first-round draft picks in 1996, 1998 and 2000.
Webber, one of the National Basketball Association's most talented young players, leaves Golden State after only one season -- a season in which he was voted the league's rookie of the year.
But a personality clash between Webber and Don Nelson, the Warriors' coach and general manager, triggered today's deal, which could have a dramatic impact on both franchises.


The Worlds of Islam
"Allah o akbar" -- "God is great" -- begins the call to prayer resonating from mosques in cities and villages from China to Morroco, from New York City to Timbuktu.
It is also the war cry of Islamic militants throughout the Umma, the lands of the faithful.
As an Iranian transplanted in the West, I have long sought to understand the tensions in Muslim societies.
For more than seven years, I traveled to the Muslim world -- 29 countries in all -- to photograph the conflict between the people's desire for modernization and the rising political movement seeking inspiration from a mythical past.
In Egypt, I saw a female student, fully covered by veil, gloves and glasses, peering into a microscope.
When I photographed Shiites rhythmically beating their bare chests during the mourning period of Ashura, only the tall buildings hovering over made me aware that I was on Seventh Avenue in New York City.
By taking readers on a journey through the Muslim world, I hope to help them understand why we are witnessing a resurgence of Islam, traditional and militant, in Western as well as Eastern societies.

General Motors Cries Foul On Hearing Over Trucks
With a bruising legal complaint attacking the Transportation Secretary's credentials and judgment, the General Motors Corporation today filed suit to bar the Government from pursuing his claim that up to six million G.M. pickup trucks may pose an unreasonable risk of killing their drivers and passengers.
G.M. lawyers are also weighing whether to seek a preliminary injunction, based on the suit, to block the Transportation Department from holding a public hearing on the pickup trucks.


Corrections
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the sale of fitness-gear subsidiaries of Weider Health and Fitness referred incorrectly to two investors in Icon Health and Fitness Inc., which acquired the businesses.
A minority stake will be held by the Weider brothers -- Joe and Ben -- not the Bain brothers. (Bain Capital is the parent of Icon.)


Correction Chief Declares Rikers Island Under Control
Despite three days of food and work strikes by thousands of inmates at Rikers Island, the city's Correction Commissioner said yesterday that "we're not losing control" and insisted that the Giuliani administration's plan to cut the number of correction officers by 900 would not risk the safety of officers or inmates.
The Commissioner, Anthony J.  Schembri, told members of the City Council that while the $31.6 million in new budget cuts planned for his department were "significant reductions," the impression that Rikers Island was on the brink of a crisis was being whipped up by department employees, inmates and the news media.


Good and Bad Gingrich
Watching the first days of Speaker-in-waiting Newt Gingrich is a little like watching the start of a buffalo stampede.
There is a lot of dust in the air, but it is impossible to tell exactly what is going to get trampled.
In his initial instructions to his followers in the House of Representatives, Mr.
Gingrich unveiled some ideas that could earn him a place as a historic reformer and some others that would put him alongside the worst of the Democratic hacks he helped defeat.
His instincts on committees and committee chairmanships seem basically sound.
He passed over some seasoned time-servers in favor of more vigorous junior members.
That is a healthy precedent and shows a willingness to overturn the Democratic habit of rewarding Congressional survivalists with power out of proportion to their talents.


No-Webber Warriors No Solace For Knicks
The Knicks ended a disappointing trip with a frustrating loss.
Unnerved by foul trouble in the fourth quarter, the Knicks dropped a 109-100 decision to the Golden State Warriors tonight at the Oakland Coliseum, sending them home with three loses on their four-game trip.

A Scientist Says He Has Isolated Dinosaur DNA
After two years of painstaking analysis and hundreds of unsuccessful attempts, a scientist at Brigham Young University has extracted the genetic material DNA from what he thinks are bone fragments of 80-million-year-old dinosaurs.
The surprise was that the recovered DNA bore little or no resemblance to that of any modern animals.
It is "like nothing we've ever seen before," said Dr.
Scott R. Woodward, an associate professor of microbiology at the university in Provo, Utah, who directed the study.


Bacardi to Drop Burson-Marsteller
Bacardi Imports will not renew a multimillion-dollar public relations contract with Burson-Marsteller after two executives at the public relations firm made remarks opposing the United States embargo of Cuba.
Jose Argamasilla Bacardi, a spokesman for Bacardi in Miami, said, "They have a different business philosophy than we do." He added that the conflict was not with Burson-Marsteller but with two executives in its Washington office, Kirby Jones and Pierre Salinger, who made the remarks.


Underwhelming Nets Top Understaffed Foe
The revival continued for a second straight game because the Nets were not terribly erratic.
The return of their stellar shooting, which has routinely been absent, was refreshing for long spells.
The Nets won again.
Really.
They made it arduous on themselves again.
Really.
Piecing together intense back-to-back efforts for the first time this season, the Nets barely subdued the confused and undermanned Washington Bullets, 111-103, tonight at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.


New Status Puts Dole in Crosscurrents on GATT
The phone is ringing endlessly at Senator Bob Dole's offices in Kansas and on Capitol Hill, but not just with congratulations for his new status as majority-leader-in-waiting.
Barely nine days after he was swept to a victory even he did not predict, he is caught in the cross-currents as Republican party leader and nascent statesman, as potential Presidential candidate and as a free-trader with second thoughts about the popularity of free trade.


It's Cheaper in Queens: Mets Don't Raise Prices
In an effort to woo back fans following the strike-shortened 1994 season, the Mets announced yesterday that they would not raise ticket prices in 1995 and took steps to make season-ticket and ticket-plan purchases more convenient for their fans.
For the fourth straight year, Shea Stadium ticket prices will remain at $15 for field, loge and mezzanine boxes, $12 for upper level boxes and reserved seats on the loge and mezzanine levels and $6.50 for seats in the upper deck.


Palacio Enters Plea
The former featherweight champion RUBEN PALACIO of Colombia entered a not guilty plea to heroin charges yesterday through his attorney in Miami.
Palacio was arrested Nov. 6 at Miami International Airport.
A Federal grand jury's two-count indictment charged him with importation of heroin and possession with intent to distribute heroin. (AP)


Confession Rehearsed, Suspect Says
The defendant in the Rockland County murder and carjacking trial said today that he was "rehearsed and coached" by two detectives into giving a 49-page confession to an assistant district attorney just hours after the crime.
But prosecutors said Edward L. Summers, the 23-year-old premedical student charged with the crime, was so specific in his statement to Anita Giannico Conklin, the assistant district attorney, down to casual conversations with the victims and the complex directions to reach the deserted field where the driver of a stolen Jeep was fatally shot, that it might be difficult to convince the jury that the statement was not authentic.


Five Shows Focus on World War II Generation
One benefit of the dense gallery scene in Manhattan is the frequency with which individual exhibitions serendipitously intersect and overlap, their separate beams coalescing to spotlight a certain period or generation.
Perhaps because of the big museum shows -- Cy Twombly at the Museum of Modern Art, the Italians at the Guggenheim Museum and, especially, Willem de Kooning at the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- the generation of the moment is the one that emerged during or directly after World War II.
A show of Barnett Newman's early work at Pace Gallery and the mini-retrospective of Alberto Giacometti at Acquavella are just two examples.
This weekend brings five more solo shows to uptown galleries that feature painters from this fertile period.
Two of these shed further light on Abstract Expressionism: Mr. de Kooning's achievement is the subject of one effort while another presents the gestural portraits produced by Elaine de Kooning, his wife, in the mid-1950's.
But luckily, the remaining shows are devoted to Mark Tobey and Steve Wheeler, two maverick, less routinely visible sensibilities, and to the young Richard Diebenkorn; these serve as important reminders that even in its heyday, Abstract Expressionism was not the only game around.


Jenkins a Cubs Coach
FERGUSON JENKINS, a 20-game winner for six straight seasons with the Chicago Cubs from 1967 to 1972, will join the Cubs as pitching coach, the team said yesterday.
It will be his first such assignment on the major league level.
Jenkins, who spent 19 seasons with four teams in the majors and was a 20-game winner seven times, has spent the last two years as a roving instructor in the Cincinnati Reds' minor league system.
He also spent two seasons as pitching coach with Texas' Class AAA affiliate at Oklahoma City.

New Therapy For Menopause Reduces Risks
A three-year study of nearly 900 women may result in a significant refinement in hormone replacement therapy after menopause.
The study found that a mixture of the two hormones estrogen and progestin is better than estrogen alone, protecting women not only against the risk of uterine cancer but heart attacks as well.
The findings, described yesterday at a meeting of the American Heart Association in Dallas, should help resolve a vexing issue facing the more than 40 million American women past menopause.
While estrogen alone was known to significantly reduce a postmenopausal woman's risk of cardiovascular disease, it also increased her risk of uterine cancer.


Israeli-P.L.O. Talks: A Growing Mistrust
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization are struggling to keep their peace talks alive against a backdrop of growing mistrust and rancor.
Barely a week ago, Israel agreed to procedural changes in the negotiations to give a boost to the faltering P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat.
But such a gesture did not put an end to underlying suspicions and charges of bad faith.


A Major Star Date In Enterprise History
Thirteen "Star Trek" books are sold every minute, and that's just on the planet Earth.
The Trekkie phenomenon is so indefatigable that there's even a volume ("Trek: The Lost Years," by Edward Gross) about a time period when the television show was off the air.
In the face of such enthusiasm, a "Star Trek" film needn't do more than exist to generate sighs of contentment among die-hard fans.
But a couple of them ("II" and "IV") have had legitimate crossover potential, bridging the entertainment gap between the Starship Enterprise and the real world.
"Star Trek Generations" is the series' most ambitious film, if only because it mixes the casts of two "Star Trek" television series with the help of "some sort of a temporal flux." For readers who find it baffling that there even are two television series (actually there are three, with a fourth on the way), the question is obvious.
How much interest does this new installment hold for general audiences, for "Trek"-resistant moviegoers who turn elsewhere for their religious experiences and wouldn't know a main deflector shield from a satellite dish?
What can "Generations" really say to the jargon-impaired?


11th Police Suicide Leaves A Void, and Questions
Monday, the day Officer Daniel Atkinson killed himself, had seemed like an ordinary day.
He drove the congested streets of downtown Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights giving out tickets to double-parked cars and vehicles blocking intersections.
For five years in the 84th Precinct, he had done pretty much the same thing.


Russians Grouse (at U.S. Embassy)
Russians are once again complaining about long lines, red tape and bone-chilling rudeness from petty bureaucrats.
Only now they maintain that such typical Soviet-era indignities are rampant in the consular section of the American Embassy.


Whitman: 'Can't Back Off'
When Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman appeared on Bob Grant's talk show yesterday, the topic -- not unexpectedly -- was her decision not to appear on his show except to discuss intolerance.
These are excerpts.
WHITMAN: It was never about you and me and I tried to make that clear from the very beginning.
It was about my concern of the kind of dialogue that has been happening -- it's happening more and more.
It's not just happening here, it's happening on a lot of shows, but particularly because you have been a supporter of mine, you and I agree on a lot of issues -- on the tax issues, on government issues, on a lot of criminal justice issues -- that it became even more important that I show that I am consistent.
I have spoken out whether it was Khalid Abdul Mohammed, who said things that I felt were divisive.
I need to speak out on that because language affects behavior and I know that you have a great deal of influence, you have a very loyal listenership many of whom believe in what's said on the air and they -- they take it to heart.
And the problem that I have that -- where you're starting to get into more and more, and again it's happening on a lot of different airwaves, that's troubling to me is that we allow that talk -- some of it very divisive by categorizing groups of people because of who they are: race, religion, age, and then thinking that when the radio's turned off somehow that -- all that's forgotten.
And my concern is that it's not, that people take that home with them and it makes it very difficult for them to work and live in a multicultural, multiracial society that we have today.


Corrections
An obituary on Nov. 10 about John Hadley, an investor of Lloyd Harbor, L.I., misstated the location of the boarding school from which his wife, Robin Tieken Hadley, was graduated.

I.Q. Tests Serve to Keep Us All in Our Places
To the Editor:
Richard A. Gardner's name for "intelligence tests" -- "Tests That Predict Success or Failure in the School System From Which the Questions Have Been Derived" (letter, Nov. 12) -- mirrors the circular method that produced them.
While Dr.
Gardner appears to dismiss I.Q. tests as measures of intelligence, his criticism is merely semantic.


Juggling Scimitars and Identities
As fearless as they are foolhardy, the Flying Karamazov Brothers have juggled everything from scimitars to Shakespeare, but these faux Russian zanies are irrepressibly iconoclastic, even about the art of the juggle.
Looking back at the beginning of their careers, Howard Jay Patterson, the most daring of the Karamazovs, said: "Basically, juggling was an excuse to get people to stop and look at us while we talked. And we found that juggling sharp things was a really good excuse." In their new Broadway show, "The Flying Karamazov Brothers Do the Impossible" (opening tomorrow at the Helen Hayes Theater), "there are battleaxes and swords and sickles and hatchets and -- we kill ourselves," he said.
"Every single night!"


What Turkey Gives in Return for U.S. Military and Foreign Aid
To the Editor:
"Deadly Gifts to Greece and Turkey" (editorial, Nov. 13) offers outright misperceptions and distortions about Turkey.


Unlimited Monthly Subway Pass With Free Transfers Is Proposed
After 90 years of charging a single flat fare for every ride, transit officials yesterday proposed a new system that would allow New Yorkers to buy monthly passes with unlimited trips and permit free transfers between buses and subways.
To pay for the discounts, the basic $1.25 fare would rise by 10 cents.
But the future of the long-awaited proposals is likely to be caught in the crosscurrents of state politics and may hinge on the outcome of the political feud between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Governor-elect George E. Pataki.


Russian Emigre Orchestra
The New York Association for New Americans was started last year to help resettle emigres from the former Soviet Union.
And since quite a few of those emigres are musicians, the organization has sponsored the New American Chamber Orchestra, a project meant to keep the players employed in something like the manner to which they were accustomed.
The orchestra, which is conducted by Beth Cohen, presented a wide-ranging program at Merkin Concert Hall on Tuesday evening.
As an ensemble, the group has problems with unity and intonation, but it addressed the music with an appealing energy and concentration.

Davenport And Date Reach Semifinals
It could be a case of beginner's luck, in stereo.
It could be the after-effects of several exhilarating shopping expeditions to Greenwich Village, new territory for 18-year-old Lindsay Davenport, now the highest-ranked and only American-born player in the Top 10.


Some on Right See A Tactical Misstep On School Prayer
The speed with which Representative Newt Gingrich moved to put school prayer at the top of his political agenda this week has both astounded the conservative groups traditionally allied with that cause and left some of them worrying that he is moving too far, too fast.
While generally pleased at the revival of a cause that seemed moribund, many of the leading conservative groups involved with the issue are concerned that in supporting a constitutional amendment that would fundamentally change the Bill of Rights, Mr.
Gingrich may be courting the same sort of political setback that President Clinton incurred when he pushed early in his Administration to overturn the ban on homosexuals in the military.
And they worry that even if successful, a school prayer effort could hand liberal groups an easy target they could use to undermine support on other issues.


Democrats Find Themselves Looking Wistfully in the Window
After 40 years in power, House Democrats began today to get a taste of life in the political wilderness.
At a news conference where they were peppered with questions about the Republicans' plans, Richard A. Gephardt and other Democrats found themselves repeatedly forced to admit that they were in the dark and did not know enough to comment.


McCaughey to Lead A Study of Medicaid
Calling New York's $20.4 billion a year Medicaid program for the poor the "single largest fiscal and social challenge facing state government," Governor-elect George E. Pataki yesterday appointed his incoming Lieutenant Governor, Elizabeth P. McCaughey, to head a 20-member task force to study the problem.
The Federal Government pays for nearly half the Medicaid program in New York, with the state paying 32.3 percent, or $6.6 billion, and New York City 18.9 percent, or $3.9 billion.


A Portrait of the Artist on a City Street


Skoda Gives Its Suppliers a Place in the Auto Plant
Petr Prusa, the foreman in a brightly lit auto parts workshop, appears to be one of thousands of production workers inside an assembly plant for Skoda, the big Czech auto maker.
But Mr.
Prusa is part of a bold experiment by Skoda to improve quality and cut costs.
His group finishes bumpers, dashboards and door panels, but his employer is not Skoda but an independent parts maker that set up shop inside the plant at Skoda's invitation.
It is paying former Skoda workers less money to make parts for Skoda cars.


Chastened, T.W.A. Tries Again
When Trans World Airlines emerged from bankruptcy last fall, it gave travelers free tickets and held "spirit day" rallies for employees around the country.
The celebrations, it seems, were premature.
The airline emerged with a business plan built largely on hope.
It called for revenues to rise 70 percent, to $5.7 billion, in 1997.
Now, just one year out of bankruptcy, the airline says that revenues will be closer to $4 billion, which is almost $1 billion more than it made in 1993.


Dire Warnings for Parliament on State of Russian Army
The beleaguered Russian Defense Minister told a skeptical Parliament today that the Russian military was in disastrous shape -- underequipped, underfinanced and losing its ability to defend the motherland.
"Not a single army in the world is in such a catastrophic state," said the Defense Minister, Gen.
Pavel S. Grachev.
"I ask you to take this as a warning."


Contemporary, Yet Age-Old
The Contemporary Dance Theater of El Salvador was founded just this year.
In the best possible way, however, there was nothing new about the five-member group or what it presented on Thursday night at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, in a program that will be repeated tonight.
Compelling simplicity and freshness were keynotes of the company's style.
And what it presented was both of the late 20th century and an age-old culture.
Wound through the mostly modern music were ghostlike echoes of human cries and ancient musical instruments.
And the directness of the dancing and much of the choreography evoked the bold intensity of folk art.


Making That First Mutual Fund Purchase
Dina Deflerios, 25, wanted to get on the right track financially.
So she asked a family friend who works at Smith Barney to help her create a saving and investing plan.
"I considered doing it myself beginning in the summer of 1993, but I wasn't knowledgable enough to do it," she said.
"I needed that extra push."


The Shrinking Governor
So Governor-elect Pataki has time to buy a farm and appear on David Letterman, but he cannot find a moment for a one-on-one meeting with the Mayor of New York City.
Perhaps it goes to show that he is better at getting votes than acquiring noblesse.
Or maybe he is confused about his political cliches and thinks he is supposed to be petty, rather than gracious, in victory.
Or maybe, as Mayor Giuliani said in the campaign, Mr.
Pataki is not willing to meet unless one of his minders is around to report back to Alfonse D'Amato.
Whatever.
The point is that Mr.
Pataki's insistence on treating Rudolph Giuliani with contempt is also a sign of contempt for the city's 7.5 million citizens.
If he wants to be the Governor of upstate, Long Island and Staten Island, he ran for the wrong office.


Young Knows Losing Reflects on Him, Too
As the Giants struggle, George Young can only laugh at how last season, when the Giants were 11-5, people called him a genius.
If you believe what people say now, Young has gone from Albert Einstein to Bart Simpson.
"That's the nature of the business," said Young.
"This year's genius is next year's fool."


Amelia Lewis, 91, Victor in Case That Changed Juvenile Justice

She was 91 and lived in nearby Scottsdale.
She had suffered a brief illness, her family said.


Trust Officers' Mission Broadened by New Law
IN literature, as in life, trust officers have been characterized as the most conservative of creatures, unwilling to take even minor risks with the money they manage.
Tales abound of family assets that were depleted by inflation or of investments that far underperformed the financial markets.
In their defense, trustees have long said that they are hamstrung.
A large body of law makes preservation of capital -- and thus risk avoidance -- their primary objective, explained Isabel Miranda, director of the trusts and estates department at Citibank in New York.


Jets Expect Vikings To Enter Hitting
This is how nasty the Vikings' defense is early in a game:

White House Warns of Market Jolt if Trade Pact Is Defeated
Raising the stakes in the Administration's effort to round up votes for a world trade agreement, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen warned today that its defeat could have "a very negative effect on the financial markets of this country."
The prediction was a high-risk strategy for the White House: it sets up a prophecy that could become self-fulfilling if the 123-nation trade accord fails to get through Congress.


Feinstein Claims Victory in Senate Race
After a drawn-out count of absentee ballots, Senator Dianne Feinstein declared victory today over Representative Michael Huffington in a re-election race that was the costliest Congressional election ever.
"The vote clearly indicates that I shall continue to represent California," Ms.
Feinstein said in her victory statement, releasing statistics from state election officials that indicated the count of the absentee ballots had placed her 147,404 votes ahead of her challenger, with only 156,210 ballots left to count.


Yonkers Mayor And Wife Sued Over the Loss Of a Contract
Mayor Terence M. Zaleski and his wife, Lynn, have been sued by the owner of a small public relations company, who charged that he lost his advertising contract with the city last spring after he failed to find a publisher for a children's book written by the Mayor's wife.
Ralph Newman, the owner of the Yonkers company TBE Associates, said in the lawsuit that he worked hard to try to place the Mayor's wife's book but that it was rejected by 37 publishers.
He said in the suit that she was disappointed by his lack of success and that she called him at 7:30 one morning a year ago and said to him "in a screaming monologue" that "TBE and Ralph Newman would never again get another dime from Yonkers."


Peter McKean, 50, Audio Store Founder
Peter Thomas McKean, a pioneer in the development of the all-electronics department store, died on Tuesday while returning from a business trip to Nevada.
He was 50 and lived in Manhattan, Southhampton, L.I., and West Palm Beach, Fla.
The cause was a heart attack, according to his companion, Justin Baxter.


In Performance: POP; A Simple Structure For Be-Bop Improvisation
Smalls
Spike Wilner's sextet knew exactly what it was doing on Tuesday and how to do it.
Mr.
Wilner, a pianist best known for leading several jam-session bands around town, made fairly simple structural demands on his group, and he and his musicians turned the small-group be-bop rules into a playground for improvisation.


Charlotte N. Montgomery Consumer Writer, 90
Charlotte N. Montgomery, a pioneering consumer writer, died on Nov. 10 in Amherst Nursing Home in Amherst, Mass., where she had lived since April.
She was 90 and had lived in Westfield, N.J., for most of her life.
She died of pneumonia, said her daughter, Sarah Montgomery of South Hadley, Mass.


In Performance: POP; Updating Gospel Music, Or at Least Trying
Beacon Theater
Jesus may have warned his followers to beware of wolves in sheep's clothing in the Book of Matthew, but what about sheep in wolves' clothing?
That's what gospel music has become, dressing its message up in contemporary secular styles.
One such disguise is the club-music-informed, urban-contemporary gospel of Grammy-winning acts like the siblings BeBe and CeCe Winans and the Sounds of Blackness choir, who performed on Tuesday night.


I.Q. Tests Serve to Keep Us All in Our Places; Measuring Intelligence
To the Editor:
"What Do I.Q. Tests Measure? Not Intelligence" by Richard A. Gardner (letter, Nov. 12) is such a collection of half-truths, distortions and inaccuracies that it takes a place toward the bottom among the heated attacks made against the book "The Bell Curve," by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray.


Janet Ahlberg, 50, Children's Illustrator
Janet Ahlberg, who created the illustrations for a series of memorable children's books written by her husband, Allan, died on Tuesday in Leicester, England.
She was 50.
The cause was cancer, said a statement from the Ahlbergs' publisher, Little, Brown &amp; Company.


Executive Changes
CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE, Toronto, appointed J. Matthew Singleton executive vice president.
He will be based in New York.
INTERNATIONAL RETAIL SYSTEMS INC., Irving, Tex., named Roger Bryant president and chief executive, succeeding Dwight Romanica, who continues as chairman.


Remembering the Player They Called Spider
He was first to study hall, last to leave.
He fit three jobs into his day, sent his spare change to his mother in Brooklyn and wrote reggae lyrics on paper napkins.
Richard Saunders is the latest college basketball player to die young, and the San Francisco State campus reacted tonight with a moment of silence.
But only a brief one because the player they called Spider was rarely quiet himself.
Students here lovingly recalled him as an extrovert, a loud dresser who wore eight rings at a time, baggy pants and a glow-in-the-dark junior college state championship jacket.


Messier Joins Gretzky's Tour
Mike Barnett, the agent for Wayne Gretzky, said yesterday that a Gretzky-sponsored touring team will leave for Europe after one exhibition hockey game in North America.
The game will be on Dec. 1 against the Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey League at the Palace in Auburn Hills, Mich.
One of Gretzky's touring teammates will be Mark Messier, captain of the Rangers and a longtime friend of The Great One.
"I am sure I'll be on board," Messier said yesterday by telephone from his home in Hilton Head, S.C.


Vampires More Verbal Than Oral
They may not be as decorative as Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, but the vampires who inhabit "Swoop," a diverting bit of intellectual vaudeville at the SoHo Repertory Theater, certainly have more impressive vocabularies.
That's because they are the creations of Mac Wellman, a playwright whose approach to a subject seems to involve throwing a crazy salad of words at it and seeing which ones stick.
His neck-biters say things like, "The lack of that adamant is my mitigating modality." Clearly, this is not Bela Lugosi speaking.
"Swoop" is an antic, meditative postscript to Mr.
Wellman's "Dracula," one of the high points of the last fringe-theater season, in which he used the framework of Bram Stoker's tale to explore the decline of the Victorian era.
Here he has taken a trio of undead souls (played by four actors, since one of the characters is split into ego and id) from the earlier play and transplanted them to the present, where they hover over the New York metropolitan area contemplating the "world of blur" beneath them in a quartet of monologues.





Carjacking Murder Suspect and Cross-Examiner Icily Argue
Under an intense cross-examination, Edward L. Summers today clung to his story that a flamboyant Bronx drug dealer shot two Rockland County teen-agers during a carjacking last January and that he himself only drove the stolen Jeep back to the Bronx.
District Attorney Kenneth Gribetz tried repeatedly to rattle Mr.
Summers, first by hopscotching wildly through Mr.
Summers's narrative of the crime, then by mocking the existence of the purported drug dealer, known only as Dino.
Mr.
Gribetz contends Dino is a fictional character created by Mr.
Summers as part of an intricate tale to cover up Mr.
Summers's killing of one of the youths, Michael Falcone, and wounding of the second, Scott Nappi.


Frank R. Thoms Jr., Athletic Director, 85
Frank R. Thoms Jr., who served as director of athletics at Williams College from 1950 to 1971, died on Monday at Geisinger Medical Center in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

His family said he was stricken with viral pneumonia during a trip from his home in East Boothbay, Me.


Abidjan Journal; The Little Railroad That Couldn't Goes Private
In the 14 years that Kouassi Kouadio has been riding the railroad that links the skyscrapers of Abidjan and Ouagadougou, the dusty capital of neighboring Burkina Faso, expectations of an ever-quickening world delivered by modern transportation seem to have been cruelly thrown into reverse.
While reports from far away speak of trains growing ever more competitive with air travel, the tracks that bear Mr.
Kouadio on the 704-mile route have grown rusted and bent, making what was once a zippy 24-hour trip an aggravating three-day journey.


Hurricane Gordon Weakens Suddenly
A deadly Hurricane Gordon that had lingered menacingly for much of the day off the Outer Banks of North Carolina weakened suddenly this afternoon to a tropical storm and doubled back toward Florida and the Caribbean, where it began almost 10 days ago.
But given its zigzagging path so far, hurricane forecasters were not certain that the storm would not change course again.


Trying to Make the Numbers Add Up
Bargaining representatives for major league baseball players continued to crunch numbers today and into the night to see if there is any room for negotiations on a new tax system team owners have proposed in hopes of ending a strike that has shut down the game for more than three months.
The union said the numbers in the owners' proposal were too punitive, but that they would continue to study the framework of the plan to see if there was room for discussion.
For their part, the owners said they believe they are moving closer to the players' desires by tabling the concept of a "hard" salary cap, meaning a rigid one that would, according to the union, artificially limit salaries.


Symphonies That Rumble and Buzz
At the Kitchen on Wednesday night, Glenn Branca conducted the world premiere of his Symphony No. 8 ("The Mystery") with a clenched fist.
The posture was right for the music, a continuous, evolving gale created by eight electric guitars, bass and drums.
The two-movement symphony and its companion work, Symphony No. 10 ("The Mystery Part 2"), which will be performed at the Kitchen through Sunday, filled the room with tingling, blaring, buzzing, rumbling, crackling overtones and a mixture of coiled tension and annunciatory zeal.
Mr.
Branca is a godfather of alternative rock.
His early-1980's works for massed, retuned guitars, lingering over structures as elemental as a sustained E major chord, revealed new possibilities for guitar ensembles.
Members of Sonic Youth performed with Mr.
Branca, and the first Sonic Youth recordings, which meshed punk-rock songs with Branca-like tremolo guitars, appeared on Mr.
Branca's Neutral Records.
Through Sonic Youth, innumerable other bands discovered the unpredictable beauties of electric-guitar overtones.


Macy to Close I. Magnin Specialty Chain
Getting ready for its merger with Federated Department Stores next month, R. H. Macy &amp; Company said today that it would close the venerable I. Magnin specialty chain by putting nine of its stores up for sale and converting the remaining four into either Macy's or Bullock's outlets.
Federated apparently rejected an 11th-hour $40 million bid for the entire chain from Jerry A. Magnin, whose great-grandmother founded the flagship store in San Francisco in 1876.
That store is one of the nine to be sold.


Murder Defendant Says He Felt Rejected
A Larchmont carpenter took the witness stand at his trial for the murders of the couple who bought his childhood home, and he described feeling rejected by his family and an alcohol problem that began in the sixth grade.


Market Loses Ground; G.M. at 52-Week Low
The stock market drifted lower yesterday with trading distorted by the expiration of options, known as "double witching." General Motors, a leading stock, also drifted lower and established a new 52-week low, capping a nearly monthlong decline.
But bond prices were stable, and the dollar rose, helped by news of a narrowing of the United States' trade deficit with Japan.

For the Young, Bright and Bored; Long Island School Rescues Youngsters in Academic Limbo

Reiser said.
"But now he can't coast. It's a great learning experience for Brian. I expected him to be beside himself. But he handled it really well."


In the Zion Case, a Doctor And Profession on the Stand
It was around 1 A.M., during the 17th hour of her shift at New York Hospital, that Dr.
Luise L. Weinstein, then a first-year postgraduate medical student, took her first look at a new patient named Libby Zion, 18.
In the more than 10 years since that March night, and in two days of questioning in a Manhattan courtroom this week, everything Dr.
Weinstein did in those hours -- the directions she gave, her discussions with colleagues, thoughts she had expressed to no one -- have been dissected.


The Wide Universe Of Pina Bausch
A man wearing flippers and underpants immerses himself in a water-filled aquarium.
Another tries to turn an egg with feathers attached into a glider; it crashes to the ground, yolk and all.
In a brilliantly choreographed sequence, four seated couples propel themselves across the floor like rowers in a boat and bunch up against a wall.
She's back.
Pina Bausch's latest United States premiere is a typical collage of human aspirations and failures.
But it is also surprisingly lighthearted in tone and successfully so.


Bridge
The Fall Nationals of the American Contract Bridge League began here this afternoon, with some 4,000 players looking forward to 10 days of play.
There will be seven major championships, and the most significant will be the Reisinger Board-a-Match Teams, starting a week from today.
The captain of one contending team will be Michael Becker of Teaneck, N.J., who held the West cards on the diagramed deal in the Spingold Knockout Teams in July, at the Summer Nationals in San Diego.
He opened the bidding with one diamond, then found himself defending four hearts after a take-out double by North.


In Performance: POP; Another Style Change, For a Major Pianist
Village Vanguard
Geri Allen's career has been marked by abrupt shifts in direction that have sometimes obscured her status as one of the more imposing pianists of her generation.
During the early 1980's, she wrote pieces that allowed her to use her percussive abilities, pieces that worked on ostinatos and incorporated world music and pop.
On Tuesday night, celebrating the release of a fine new album, "21" (Blue Note), she brought two musicians who reflected a radically different sensibility, one that adhered strictly to the mainstream.


Helms Voices Doubts on Clinton as Commander
Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is in line to head the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said today that President Clinton was not up to the job of being Commander in Chief.

Mets Trade Burnitz to Indians for Pitching
Jeromy Burnitz spent most the 1994 season in Dallas Green's doghouse.

Burnitz won't be back in right field for the Mets in 1995.
He will be in Cleveland, his new home as of yesterday after being traded to the Indians.
And the Mets' new right fielder just might be the Mets' former right fielder, Bobby Bonilla, who moved to third base last spring and said near the close of the strike-shortened season that he wanted to remain at that position next year.

From Totems to Taboos, The Glories of Polynesia
Although calling anyplace "paradise," as George Page finds himself doing as narrator of "Nomads of the Wind," is not stunningly original, the lusciously photographed beauty of Polynesia almost excuses the lapse.
This five-part series, presented by "Nature," sweeps across the Pacific, from Tahiti to Fiji to Easter Island to Hawaii and New Zealand, with visual pleasures all the way.
The opening episode, tomorrow, goes back 2,000 years to the venturesome people who first settled Tahiti and the Marquesas Islands.
By comparison with their journeys across the Pacific Ocean, Columbus was a stay-at-home.
Their discoveries are simulated by dramatizations, which are not always enhanced by a narration that owes something to come-to-the-islands brochures: "Each one like a jewel rises from the sea, each a possibility for a new beginning."

Editorial Notebook: The Iron Bowl Cometh; The Impossible Task Of Ceasing to Care
Yes, we are indisputably in the season of what the boys at ABC and ESPN call the "traditional rivalry." Soon enough now, the mellow voice of Keith Jackson will be heard in the land, coming to me from Birmingham's Legion Field, the Football Capital of the South.
Keith will speak once again the mindless but well-loved cliches that I know as well as some people know the mass.
Keith (I always think of him as Keith, not Mr. Jackson) will tell me that the Crimson Tide wins ugly behind the comeback skills of Jay Barker, the winningest quarterback in Alabama history.
And that's saying a lot because they've had some good ones down here -- Joe Namath, Ken Stabler, Bart Starr.
Keith will say that Auburn is on probation and out of the national championship chase, so it is playing for bragging rights in the game that folks in Alabama call the Iron Bowl.


12 Die as Arafat's Police Fire on Palestinian Militants
Yasir Arafat's police force opened fire for the first time on Palestinian protesters today, killing at least 12 people and wounding as many as 200 in street battles that raged for hours across the Gaza Strip's main city.
The police said an officer was also killed and 10 others were wounded when two police cars were set on fire.


U.N. Considers Allowing NATO To Retaliate for Serbian Attacks
The Security Council strongly condemned tonight a Serbian air attack in northern Bosnia and began considering a resolution that would allow NATO to attack airfields in neighboring Croatia from which such attacks come.

Public &amp; Private; The High Cost of Death
In the summer of 1963 Eddie Lee Mays was executed for the murder of a woman during a robbery at the Friendly Tavern in Harlem.
The robbery netted $275 and, in a small way, gave Eddie Mays a place in history.
When he was buckled into the electric chair at Sing Sing, he became the last person executed by the State of New York.
Until now.
Until now, for in January New York will have, for the first time in many years, both legislators inclined to restore the death penalty and a Governor determined to sign the bill.
In this they would join a coterie of politicians in 37 states who have answered what they believe is the blood lust of a terrified and angry electorate with the ultimate illusory sop to violent crime.

Small-Company Group Can Bounce Around
Mutual funds that specialize in small companies can put some zip in a portfolio, but they can zip in either direction, as shown by the disappointing returns this year of many of the three-year winners.
Given the group's volatility, it may be wise to limit such funds to 10 or 15 percent of a portfolio and buy them for the long term.
Jennifer Newport, a fund analyst with Morningstar Mutual Funds, attributed the winners' strong performance in recent years to two types of holdings.
Technology stocks, which enjoyed a strong run-up in the third quarter, powered several of the funds' growth over the three-year period.
Financial services stocks gave several funds a lift in recent years, but then set them back with this year's rise in interest rates.

Tax Plan More Stick Than Carrot
The owners' new tax proposal would create a tax collector's dream, but a baseball player's nightmare.
If the system the owners placed on the bargaining table Thursday and discussed with the players today in a Washington suburb had been in full effect in an uninterrupted season this year, 18 clubs would have paid nearly $193 million in taxes.
The Yankees would have served as the collector's most coveted customer, paying $31 million in payroll luxury taxes.
Of the 17 other clubs that would have been taxed, the Mets would have paid the least, $698,072.

After Trip, Knicks Vow To Go on Offensive
The Knicks have returned home, but they are more concerned with a return to winning.
Losing three of four games on their Western trip forced the Knicks to take a hard early-season look at themselves.

Derek Harper admitted that the Knicks have not played with the intensity that was habitual last season.
And Coach Pat Riley seemed more perplexed than angry after watching the Knicks commit a season-high 25 turnovers against the Warriors.


Nets Go Down Complaining About Refs' Calls in Orlando

Orlando was moments away from seizing control when Kenny Anderson eyeballed an official, Bill Oakes, whom Anderson thought had put Derrick Coleman and himself on the wrong end of a few foul calls.


Sports of The Times; The End Of a Winding Road
SHORTLY before a memorial service for Wilma Rudolph yesterday morning, Mae Faggs Starr, a former Olympic sprinter, pointed to a collection of photographs mounted on a podium that captured Rudolph in various phases of her outstanding track career.
Starr was an original member of the Tennessee State University Tigerbelles.
In 1948, she became the youngest women on the United States Olympic team.
The picture she called attention to yesterday was a 1956 photo of six young women smiling broadly, wearing Olympic track uniforms.


Germs of Sverdlovsk
The Russian city of Sverdlovsk suffered an epidemic of anthrax in 1979 that Soviet-era officials attributed to contaminated meat.
Now there is proof of what Washington long suspected -- that the outbreak was caused by airborne anthrax released from a military microbiology facility.
The report, published by a team of U.S. and Russian scientists in the current Science magazine, traces many of the victims to an area south of the plant.
The obvious surmise is that the installation was manufacturing germ-warfare agents, a violation of the 1972 treaty banning biological weapons.
The findings should accelerate U.S. efforts to strengthen the 1972 ban, which was signed without verification procedures.
True, small quantities of germ warfare agents can easily be concealed, making the ban difficult to verify, but larger amounts in weapon form are harder to hide.
The main impediment to germ warfare remains what it was when the ban was signed -- doubt that germs can be precisely targeted in a militarily useful way.

BASKETBALL Bradley Hits a High  Shawn Bradley reached career highs with 28 points and 22 rebounds and had 9 blocked shots last night to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 97-83 home victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, the only National Basketball Association team without a victory this season.
The Clippers' eighth straight defeat set a franchise record for consecutive losses at the start of the season.


Political Memo; Neither Pataki Nor Giuliani Will Turn Other Cheek
Sometimes politics is about vengeance more than valor, about pride more than policy, and the nasty feud between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Governor-elect George E. Pataki seems to be one of those times.
Although there might seem to be great political benefit for both men in an instant rapprochement, the bitterness between them now is just too great, according to their aides.
In part, the ill will is being fueled by advisers to both men whose memories of a brutal campaign remain too fresh to give way to constructive compromise.
On Mr.
Pataki's side, many of those aides also have close ties to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who has himself fought fiercely with Mr.
Giuliani for years.
And in the center are two strong-willed politicians who know how to hold a grudge: Mr.
Giuliani, whose quick temper and sometimes biting manner are well known, and Mr.
Pataki, whose genial exterior belies a steely political will.


What to Consider When Making Medical Choices for 1995
The choices in medical and dental plans can be mind boggling for employees, who each year at this time are loaded down with information.
The biggest decision: whether to stay with a traditional medical plan, which reimburses people for a portion of expenses, or to join a network, which covers all visits to a select group of doctors.
To provide some guidance, benefit specialists were asked about changes in medical plans and what tends to trip employees up.
They are David Wilson, managing director of the Apex Group, health actuaries of Princeton, N.J.; Chris Mooney, a partner in the Stamford, Conn., office of Foster Higgins, a benefits firm, and officials of Mobil, Coca-Cola and Betz Laboratories.


An Act of Youthful Savagery Stuns a Suburb
It is barely three miles to Abington Township from Philadelphia.
But in the minds of many of the township's people, the distance is far greater.
It is the distance, real or imagined, between urban violence and suburban serenity.
That space was irreversibly bridged last Friday night when, the police say, as many as two dozen Abington youths armed with baseball bats piled into cars, drove into the Fox Chase neighborhood of Northeast Philadelphia and confronted a group of teen-agers who ran off.


Cowboys Fined for Not Reporting Injury
Commissioner PAUL TAGLIABUE fined the Dallas Cowboys $10,000 yesterday for violating the National Football League's policy on reporting injuries.
According to the league, the Cowboys failed to follow proper procedures Nov. 11 after quarterback TROY AIKMAN injured his right thumb during practice.
N.F.L. policy requires teams to supply information on all injured players to the league office on Wednesdays and Thursdays for release to the news media.

In a Bad Year for Bonds, A Case for Foreign Debt
THE Fed's big rate rise this week?
Albert D. Friedberg sympathizes with bond investors over it, and over their many other woes.
But he is easily cheered.
He just thinks about his three-month bonds that earned a 31 percent annualized return.

The catch: the bonds are foreign, from Turkey and New Zealand, respectively.
To get such enviable returns, Mr.
Friedberg, head of the Friedberg Mercantile Group, had to court political, currency-exchange and other perils that some advisers say should be red flags for all but well-heeled bond buyers.

A front-page article on Friday about President Clinton's views on prayer in schools misstated the view of Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn.
He supports a voluntary moment of silence, not voluntary prayer.


Observer; Why So Pale And Wan?
This is a plea to Democrats.
Many are planning to leave the country.
Others are threatening to open veins.
A few talk of forming survival groups and fleeing to the woods.
Most, however, simply sit around weeping.
To these Democrats I say, Pull yourselves together.
The recent Republican victory is not the worst blow to civilization since Attila the Hun popularized sacking and pillage.
Not at all.
The unterrifying fact is that Republicans are no more inhuman than my Uncle Jack, of whom Aunt Pat used to say, "Jack's not tough, he just needs a shave."
I have known Republicans from my cradle and and have never been bitten, or even sued, by a single one.
Republicans are just like human beings, except for their demented conviction that repealing the capital-gains tax can save the world.
My Uncle Irvey was a Republican.
He was a Southerner, but when Democrats ran the Catholic Al Smith for President in 1928, Uncle Irvey did not terrify neighborhood Protestants with warnings that a victorious Al Smith would move the Pope into the White House.
The local Protestant Democrats did it for him.
Republicans are decent.
One lent me the rent money once without asking collateral.
A Republican is godmother to one of my children and has never sought to corrupt the child's faith by preaching salvation through repealing the capital-gains tax.
Republicans, in short, are not much different from people, so it is silly for Democrats to be terrified.
Think, Democrats, think.
Your party has really been just a rudderless variation on the Republican party since Hubert Humphrey lost to Richard Nixon 25 years ago.
After that the decline of the labor unions left it bereft of ideas, and its only Presidents have been those two old-fashioned Rockefeller Republicans: Carter and Clinton.
For evidence of the Democratic vacuum, how about that Rube Goldberg health-care bill the President offered?
Republicans used to be called "me-tooers" because they couldn't think of much to do except go along with Democratic ideas.
Democrats are the new "me-tooers," which is probably why "me-tooers" are now called "new Democrats." President Clinton is a specimen "new Democrat"; that is, a Democrat who thought Eisenhower had it just about right.
You can tell "new Democrats" by their conviction that "liberalism" is their deadliest enemy and their lack of any ideas not likely to be approved by the better class of Republicans.
With Democrats now residing in the abandoned tents of the old Eisenhower Republicanism, why this Democratic panic about Republicans running Congress?
Well, it's the triumph of the Republican mossbacks of course: Gingrich, Helms, the Western right-wingers of the cowboy welfare states, all those Dixiecrats who used to be Democrats until Republicans became the white man's party.
It's the same crowd that couldn't abide Nelson Rockefeller and would have chucked Eisenhower if he hadn't had such a way with the voters.
Newt Gingrich is the Republican who makes Democrats think of Walpurgis Night.
With everybody talking about Gingrich's "first hundred days," you might think he is the new Franklin Roosevelt risen out of Georgia to rebuild a stricken nation.
The unreality is intensified by Gingrich's announcement that he will not compromise in dealing with that lesser fellow who calls himself President.
This is harmless nonsense, except that people who should know better take it seriously.
Gingrich, whose skill at mischief-making is considerable but whose talents for governance have not been tested, is doubtless blustering to cover the natural insecurity of a youngish gent in charge of a crew that hasn't sailed a ship for 40 years.
Democrats should allow the possibility that he is playing bad Captain Bligh just now, largely because he is shocked and maybe a bit scared to find himself in command.
What else explains his "no-compromise" declaration?
It's institutionally impossible for Congress to lead.
House members who desire the slightest accomplishment absolutely must compromise, and not just with Presidents, but also with Senates.
I should like to assure the Democrats that they have nothing to fear but fear-of-Newt itself, but that would mislead them.
A party that doesn't stand for much has plenty to fear from one that stands for plenty, even when, as now, it looks like plenty of nothing.

Woman Says She Was Raped In a Carjacking
A 57-year-old woman reported that a man commandeered her car at gunpoint in Flushing, Queens, and forced her to drive to a motel, where he raped her, the police said yesterday.
Investigators are looking into whether the incident may be part of a series of carjackings and rapes in northeastern Queens.
The woman told the police that the man approached her about 10 A.M. yesterday at the corner of 153d Street and 76th Road as she was getting into her car to go to work, said Capt.
Robert Cea, of the Queens Detective Bureau.


Beliefs
Having gambled $6 million on the popularity of Pope John Paul II's new book, what did the editors at Alfred A. Knopf think when they discovered their eminent author tossing in references to "the early and the late works of Ludwig Wittgenstein" or to "contemporary hermeneutics -- examples of which are found in the work of Paul Ricoeur or, from a different perspective, in the work of Emmanuel Levinas"?
Did beads of sweat break out on their foreheads as they read the page on which the Pope explains how Descartes "inaugurated the great anthropocentric shift in philosophy" and brought the world to "the threshold of modern immanentism and subjectivism"?


Another Arkansan Quits White House Staff
William Kennedy 3d, a onetime law partner of Hillary Rodham Clinton, has resigned as associate White House counsel and will return to private life in Little Rock, Ark., the White House said today.
Mr.
Kennedy had an occasionally stormy tenure in an office that has itself been controversial during Mr.
Clinton's time in office.
A White House spokeswoman, Ginny Terzano, said Mr.
Kennedy was completing his work today and would return to Arkansas on Sunday.


Feinstein Declares Victory in California
Ten days after the voting booths closed, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, declared victory in her re-election campaign against Representative Michael Huffington, her Republican challenger.
Ms.

Huffington virtually eliminated mathematically but refusing to concede.

Bratton Builds His Image As He Rebuilds the Police
Police Commissioner William J. Bratton was addressing 50 Queens commanders at a recent strategy meeting, standing as erect as a Prussian general, his left hand dug into the jacket pocket of his double-breasted suit.
"I'm the nicest guy in the world normally, and I'm probably the best damned leader that any of you will ever have," he said.
But, expressing frustration at some detectives who had dropped cases because they misunderstood orders to cut overtime, he added, "If you're not willing to manage under my style, I'll get rid of you!"


CHRONICLE
It is imperative to continue playing the music that was composed in concentration camps during World War II, STEVEN LIPSITT, the conductor of the West Czech Symphonic Orchestra in Marienbad, said yesterday.
"I think the fact that some works have survived speaks loudly and forcefully and we are beholden to get this music performed as much and as well as possible," he said.
Mr.
Lipsitt is conducting "Der Kaiser von Atlantis," a one-act opera; three Yiddish songs, and a string quartet composed in the Terezin concentration camp in Czechoslovakia by Viktor Ullmann.
The Northeastern University Opera Terezin will perform them tonight in Boston at Northeastern University and on Monday in New York at the Merkin Concert Hall.


Kickoff Celebration


The Pataki-Giuliani Feud, Day 10: New Charges, No Solution
Ratcheting up their feud, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani accused Governor-elect George E. Pataki yesterday of carrying out a vendetta to embarrass not only him personally but also the institution of the mayoralty.
And he bluntly warned that the effort would hurt Mr.
Pataki as he turns from campaigning to governing.
A day after Mr.
Pataki's aides invited the Mayor to a meeting on Staten Island on Nov. 28 with nine other elected officials, Mr.
Giuliani said the only purpose of the meeting was to diminish the standing of the Mayor of the state's largest city.


In Performance: POP; A Dutch Band Sounds Like 1960's California
Knitting Factory
Bettie Serveert, a Dutch band active since 1991, could almost be an emissary from California in the 1960's.
The group's name, derived from a tennis-instruction book, means "Bettie served"; its music is steeped in folk-rock and psychedelia.


As Haiti Struggles to Rise Up, Storm Deals Body Blow
After a tropical storm finished battering this sleepy port on Haiti's southern coast early Monday, residents emerged from their ruined houses and began to tally the dead.
Today they were still counting, and wondering if they will ever fully calculate what they have lost.
In the aquamarine waters of the Bay of Jacmel, bodies continued to surface, mostly women and children borne downstream by three rivers that converge here.
On the outskirts of town, a concrete bridge has been washed away, severing the only overland link to the capital, Port-au-Prince.
Relief workers were able to reach the region only by sea or air.


U.S. Open Staying in Queens, Official Says
Despite cost overruns in the planned $180 million renovation of the National Tennis Center in Queens, officials of the United States Tennis Association yesterday denied rumors that they might move the United States Open to Atlanta.
J.
HOWARD (BUMPY) FRAZER, the U.S.T.A.'s president, said: "We have a contract with the city of New York, and we believe it's in the best interests of the tournament, the city and the fans that we stay here."


Amgen to Buy Synergen, a Troubled Rival
Amgen Inc., the most successful biotechnology company, said today that it would buy Synergen Inc., a weakened rival, for $240 million in cash, or $9.25 a share.
Analysts said that this deal, as well as continuing talks between the Chiron Corporation and the Swiss chemical giant Ciba-Geigy, indicated that the long anticipated biotechnology industry consolidation was under way.
But they cautioned that there were few potential acquirers and many potential acquirees because cash-starved biotechnology companies faced huge obstacles in raising money in the public markets.


Ivanisevic Fined and Faces Suspension
While his peers were advancing at the ATP World Championship in Frankfurt, GORAN IVANISEVIC was further bolstering his case for a suspension by incurring a point penalty for verbally abusing a lineswoman early in the second set against PETE SAMPRAS yesterday.
At the Paris Open, Ivanisevic surpassed $10,000 in fines in ATP events for the second straight year, which is supposed to mean a two-month suspension from the tour.
According to Ivanisevic's father, SRDJAN, his son filed an appeal on Nov. 7, the day after the Paris tournament, so he would be eligible to play in Frankfurt.


Rainy Work Where City Meets Long Island


No Longer Israeli, Gaza Police Post Is Still a Target
The Gaza police headquarters, once a hated bastion of Israeli occupation and now the nerve center of Yasir Arafat's security forces, was again the target of Palestinian rage today.
In scenes reminiscent of their uprising against Israel, hundreds of angry youths surged for hours toward the fortress-like building, hurling stones at the compound and at Palestinian policemen who responded with bursts of heavy gunfire.


Chairman Helms
Senator Jesse Helms, chair apparent of the Foreign Relations Committee, is an ideologue distrustful of international trade agreements, arms control treaties, foreign aid, the United Nations and multilateral cooperation in general.
He is also a skilled attention-getter and tactician who knows how to raise the profile of an important committee that has drifted close to irrelevance under its current Democratic chairman, Claiborne Pell.
Will Chairman Helms be a constructive or a destructive force?
The first signs are not encouraging.
On Tuesday, the Senator tried to bully President Clinton into delaying a vote on the Uruguay Round world trade agreement.
Mr.
Clinton's decision on this matter, Senator Helms suggested, would affect his own willingness to give full and fair consideration to the President's entire foreign policy agenda in the next session.


Score a Goal for Optimism At the N.H.L. Negotiations
Both sides reported optimism and progress yesterday in the National Hockey League negotiations in Boston before announcing a two-day break in the the effort to end the lockout that has delayed the start of the regular season by seven weeks.
Talks will resume Monday at an undisclosed location.
"I think they were good working sessions," said Cliff Fletcher, the president and general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs, who joined the two days of talks.
"There is something there to build on. But I would not underestimate the fact there there is still an awful lot of work to do."


Both Sides in 4-Vote Squeaker Seek 2d Connecticut Recount
Both candidates in the closest Congressional race in the nation asked the Connecticut Supreme Court today for a partial recount, three days after United States Representative Sam Gejdenson was declared the winner by four votes.
His Republican challenger, Edward W. Munster, made several complaints about the way the Nov. 8 vote was tallied, including the treatment of absentee ballots, paper ballots that he said were marked similarly but counted differently and municipalities where he charged that the number of votes cast did not equal the number of votes counted.


Three Federal Agencies Act To Curb Certain Derivatives
Three Federal agencies have decided to prepare rules barring banks from selling certain Government-guaranteed securities that take the form of derivatives to customers who cannot afford the risks involved, Federal regulators said today.
If approved, the regulations would be the first action taken by Federal agencies to require certain sellers of derivatives to determine whether these potentially volatile financial securities are suitable for their customers.


5,000 Workers Agree to Quit Municipal Jobs
With Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan to balance the city's budget dependent on cutting municipal jobs, about 5,000 workers have agreed to accept severance packages, city and union officials said yesterday.
But the program fell short of its goal of 7,600 workers, and last night Mr.
Giuliani extended the deadline to apply for two weeks.
The severance program lured 1,800 workers from the Board of Education, many more than the Mayor's office had expected, but it failed to attract enough workers in other agencies for which the Mayor had set goals.
As the three-week period to apply ended at 5 P.M., officials said applications continued to trickle in.


Treasuries End Mixed On Slow Day
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed in lackluster trading yesterday.
The bond market received support from strength in the dollar and option expirations, analysts said.
An attractive price of 97 for a December bond option helped underpin a late morning rally that pared the worst losses of the session.

Arrest in Slaying of Haitian Broadcasters
The police here have arrested a man suspected of killing two pro-democracy Haitian radio broadcasters on the same street in Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood within a 25-day period in 1991.
The suspect, Billy Alexander, a 24-year-old Bahamian of Haitian descent who is already imprisoned for another killing, was arrested on Wednesday and is the second man facing charges in the shooting of the broadcasters.


What Turkey Gives in Return for U.S. Military and Foreign Aid; Greece's Role in NATO
To the Editor:

If You're Thinking of Living In/Co-op City; A City, Bigger Than Many, Within a City
THE largest co-op housing project in the United States, Co-op City, in the Bronx, is reporting success in cutting a vacancy rate that had risen in recent years as many of the original residents retired and moved to warmer climates.
The Riverbay Corporation, the cooperative that owns the 300-acre site and buildings, reports the lowest vacancy rate in more than a decade.
Of the 15,372 units, 605 are vacant, compared with 1,500 two years ago, said Steven H. Gold, the director of sales and marketing.

Will I avoid recommendations that are risky even though high risk may be the only solution?


Here's Help for a No-Name Neighborhood
Two weeks ago on this page, Jonathan R. Butler offered some names for his no-name neighborhood, south of Houston and west of the Avenue of the Americas.
The City asked readers for their own suggestions.
Here is a selection:  To the Editor:


Dylan's Children, Without the Sanctimony
ONE OF THE MANY WEIRDO CHARACTERS on Lyle Lovett's new album, "I Love Everybody," is an eccentric misanthrope who natters on about a gold tooth his grandmother left him when she died.
He also claims he is keeping his aged uncle locked in a closet.
Addressing the world at large, he says with defensive pride, "Look around and you will see/ This world is full of creeps like me." The album's other quirky narrators include a man who identifies with fat babies because "they have no pride" and another who is obsessed with penguins because "they are so sensitive."
At the age of 37, Mr.
Lovett is recognized as one of the most gifted inheritors of the singer-songwriter tradition that Bob Dylan virtually invented 30 years ago.
But in the three decades that separate Mr.
Dylan's reign as a pop-culture god and Mr.
Lovett's ascendancy as an admired cult figure, the genre has undergone momentous shifts.


Paula Carleton, George Evans
"FOR some reason, I always thought I'd marry an English guy," said Paula Carleton, an artist and fashion stylist who grew up in Boston.
"I remember sitting around with my sister, reading English novels and listening to the Beatles and wanting to marry an Englishman. Actually, my favorite Beatle was George Harrison, so I guess I wanted to marry an English George."
When Ms.
Carleton, 34, met George Evans, 35, he seemed exactly like the man she had envisioned while reading Jane Austen.
A mutual-fund manager at the Oppenheimer Management Corporation in New York, Mr.
Evans grew up in Lancashire, England, and graduated from Eton College and Oxford University.
He is known for his polished wit, waistcoats, cuff links and manners.


Pulling the Wraps Off Koch Industries
Charles G. Koch likes to keep things simple.
He built his empire on a windswept prairie far from city life: It's a sprawling glass-and-granite office complex, the largest in Kansas, and looks like a black box rising from an empty plain.
Engineers with earnest faces and trim haircuts ply the halls of this diversified energy concern.
There's no executive dining room, just a company cafeteria.
And every day, Mr.
Koch, one of the world's richest men, stands in the lunch line just like any of his 2,000 employees here, and waits patiently to buy his meal.
Hard to tell, but Koch Industries is the nation's second-largest privately held company, after Cargill, the grain merchant.
With $23 billion in sales and 13,000 employees across the globe, Koch (pronounced coke) is an energy gusher of refineries, gas pipelines, oil trading, chemicals, cattle ranches and, increasingly, financial services.
As a supplier of raw commodities, Koch has no retail identity, but its reach is broad -- even the surface of the tennis courts at the U.S.
Open comes from Koch.

Fence the Garbage? Rats and Odors Don't Really Mind
Harlem has always had more than its share of problems with garbage: litter on the streets and sidewalks, trash in empty lots and uncared-for buildings and bags of debris sometimes tossed from apartment windows.
And with last month's budget cuts forcing the Department of Sanitation to reduce trash pickups at public housing projects, residents are fearful that their neighborhood will be hit especially hard.
To compensate residents, sanitation and housing officials came up with what they thought was a good solution: building fenced-off enclosures, where garbage and recyclables could be stored in between pickups.
Funding for the project was available through the Department of Sanitation's purchasing fund.


In One Town, Fed Move Brings Some Fear
Sitting in the Chat 'n' Chew Restaurant, Chris Adams and Dennis Price were eating their $3.75 hot turkey dinners and saying today that they were as mystified as anyone in town about the economic direction of the country.
As partners in a year-old home improvement company that has enjoyed a reasonably good start, they now have the latest interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve to think about.
The Fed action, raising the short-term interest rates it controls by three-quarters of a percentage point, was announced on Tuesday as an essential step to contain inflation.
Big banks across the country immediately raised the prime lending rate, a response generally considered bad news for people seeking loans and good news for most investors.


In the Region/Connecticut; Price Slump Energizes the Condominium Market
CONDOMINIUM units in Connecticut, at the bottom of a slump that pushed prices down to as little as half their original value, are now so attractively priced that for the first time in five years they are selling briskly.
A growing population of single men and women, empty-nesters, first-time home buyers and investors seeking an alternative to meager returns elsewhere have set the market on fire.


Arkansas Is Now Awash In Respect
This time last year, members of the University of Arkansas's men's basketball team set out on a noble mission: a quest for respect.
This is hardly an original concept and actually one of the cheaper motivational gimmicks in athletics.
But it works.
The Razorbacks believed in the cause and eagerly turned it into a crusade.
No one gave the Razorbacks credit for being a smart, hard-working and immensely talented team.
Even when Arkansas finally climbed to the top spot in the polls a loss seemed to send them on a greater plummet than other teams.


For Haitian Refugees, Fear Remains
To the Editor:
"U.S. Might Admit Detained Cubans to Help Children" (front page, Nov. 15), you report, to avoid "embarrassing demonstrations by Cuban-Americans when President Clinton meets with Latin American leaders in Miami in early December."


A Film Maker Whose Range Is Wagnerian
Krzysztof Kieslowski IS one of the last of that endangered species, the art-film director.
Unafraid of boring his audience with scenes in which little seems to happen, the Polish director of brooding, haunting films like "The Double Life of Veronique" (1991) and "Decalogue" (1988) deals in emotional nuance and unspoken dialogue in the increasingly marginalized tradition of Robert Bresson and Ingmar Bergman.
Mr.
Kieslowski continues this tradition in "Red," the widely praised finale to his "Three Colors" trilogy, which opens in New York on Wednesday.
Meeting with a group of American journalists during the Cannes Film Festival last May, Mr.
Kieslowski, 53, projected the bookish intensity of an Eastern European auteur.
He sported a buzz cut (perhaps to hide an incipient baldness), glasses and a leather jacket.
Though his English is serviceable, he preferred to speak in Polish, through a translator, in effect adding another protective layer.
He is a director who hates talking about the meaning of his films but will happily discuss technical details at length.

From Junkyards to Gardens, and Other Miracles
IT'S one thing to make a garden out of a piece of beautiful fertile land.
It's quite another to turn an abandoned lot full of junked cars and tires, crack vials and broken glass into a place of beauty.
I come upon these miracles in the heat of summer -- in places where it might be easy to give up hope -- and leave refreshed by some bright flower, or bird song or the taste of cilantro on my tongue.
And as the sunflowers turn brown and hang their big heads to the ground, it's a good time to visit "City Farmers: Operation Greenthumb," an exhibition of color photographs by Katherine McGlynn at the Museum of the City of New York, on Fifth Avenue at 103d Street.
It captures the essence of some of the city's finest community gardens and the pioneers who, with tears, laughter and plain old dogged persistence, get the corn to come up, the zinnias and roses to bloom.
And there are eloquent words from the hearts of these gardeners to accompany the pictures.

Color has always been one of fashion's key elements, and now it is being used to help people do business in Manhattan's fashion district.
The colors are part of a new map of the Fashion Center Business Improvement District, created for the Fashion Center by the Identity Map Company.
It identifies, through color coding, each building in the core of New York's rag trade according to the business interests of the preponderance of its tenants, among them apparel, accessories, jewelry, textiles and trimming.


To Make History Here, Make Music
AFTER INTERMISSION AT THE MANN auditorium here recently, I returned to my seat to find what seemed a unit of Israeli security forces peering nervously under the cushion; a small crowd stood at a safe distance.
What had drawn their attention?
An assault on a visiting critic seemed unlikely.
Then, with embarrassment, I saw the cause of the alarm: my books, lying under the seat in a plastic bag.
In Israel, one does not leave bags unattended.
And in this case, fear of an explosion may have been amplified because, for the first time, the Israel Philharmonic was playing music by Richard Strauss at a subscription concert.
Strauss was president of the central musical committee in Nazi Germany, and while his music has never inspired the moral outrage here that Wagner's has, it has long caused discomfort in this Jewish state.


Amid Affluence, Hunger Is at Home
LAST Monday morning, 74-year-old Stefan Szymik arrived at the soup kitchen at Grace Episcopal Church here for his first hot meal in three days.
The former machinist, a homeless man who said he lived meal to meal on Social Security checks, had purchased a package of luncheon meats from the local A.&amp;P. two days before but had eaten little since.
Like many of the 80 or so other people in the dining room -- the elderly, the newly unemployed, homeless and disabled among them -- Mr.
Szymik had come to depend on the bounty of the soup kitchen.


F.Y.I.
'Gimme Shelters'
Q.
On weekends, as I walk down Broadway on the Upper West Side, I see shattered glass from bus shelters every few blocks.
What is the average life span of a bus shelter's glass wall?
What is the budget for replacements?
Is anyone ever caught for breaking the glass?


The Quiet Bridge Burner . . . a Texas Legend
To the Editor:
As one who has long been sustained by dreams of quitting, I enjoyed Evan Harris's article, "Quitting: In Defense of a Maligned Act" (Viewpoints, Oct. 23).
However, I believe he has overlooked an important technique -- simply vanish.
As the name implies, this is a corollary to "fail and disappear" and "achieve and vanish," but the critical difference is that no other action is required.
The quitter just goes, without fanfare, excuse or explanation.


Here's Help for a No-Name Neighborhood
Two weeks ago on this page, Jonathan R. Butler offered some names for his no-name neighborhood, south of Houston and west of the Avenue of the Americas.
The City asked readers for their own suggestions.
Here is a selection:  To the Editor:


Friends Share a Spirit of Optimism Amid a Diversity of Styles
HANANIAH HARARI, Anthony Toney and George Kelly are friends exhibiting their paintings together at Nardin Galleries here.
The last time they did this was in 1974, when Nardin was in West Nyack and the space was too small to accommodate all their works.
The scene changes to the galleries' palatial premises here, but the problem remains essentially the same.
This time, however, it is the personalities of the artists that are too big.
"Three Friends," a show that rambles through three galleries, out into the hall and up the stairs, indicates that the artists, all natives of the state, have a certain amount in common, notably a concern with color and good draftsmanship.
But given the temperamental differences implied by their work, it is likely that as often as not they have agreed to disagree.


Shop BIG
THIS was the year the big stores took New York, the year those cavernous, low-margin, high-volume temptoriums that challenge both the old-time department store and the friendly neighborhood bookseller arrived, in critical mass, and began to remake the face of shopping as we know it.
From the Flatiron to upper Broadway, Northern Boulevard to the Grand Concourse, these stores that till now had largely shunned the city as too cramped, too expensive, and perhaps too determined to be hip, are moving in, opening up and proclaiming themselves proud to be big.


Webber Gets Spotlight, but Celtics Get Victory
Celtics 103, Bullets 102
Dee Brown crashed Chris Webber's coming-out party with the Washington Bullets, scoring 22 points and the game-winning free throws with 1.6 seconds left to give the Boston Celtics a 103-102 victory last night in Landover, Md.


What's New York the Capital of Now?: Reinvention; At the Corner of Permanence and Change
THE CABLE BUILDING STANDS AT THE JUMbled intersection of Greenwich Village, SoHo and the East Village, a juncture it commands with self-assured stateliness.
Behind its calmly imposing facade, however, is a hive of cultural, entrepreneurial and political activity.
Among the 140 or so tenants renting studios or offices there are the kinds of people who are shaping the post-industrial city: artists and architects and activists, record producers and magazine publishers, set designers and graphic designers and robot designers.
Whit Stillman, the independent film maker, has his office there, as does Charlotte Sheedy, a literary agent whose clients include Lani Guinier and Marilyn French.
What they like about the place is the offbeat tenancy, the communal spirit, the pliant spaces and decent light within, along with the feel of the surrounding neighborhood -- all of which adds up to being in a vital building in a vibrant part of New York at a dynamic time.


SURFACING
Wheels  Blader backlash?
Scraping along on old-fashioned roller skates is the latest way to get around.
They are not taken seriously for distance or speed, but some roller-dancers favor them.
They provide the same kind of sturdy ride as a trusty one-speed bicycle.
A bonus for pedestrians is that you can hear them coming. (The New York Times)

At Least Their Seconds Are Talking
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Governor-elect George E. Pataki still may not be talking, but at least their chief lieutenants are.
Mr.
Pataki and aides to Mr.
Giuliani said yesterday that the Governor-elect's counsel, Michael C. Finnegan, and the Mayor's senior aide, Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers, spoke by telephone on Friday about unspecified matters affecting the city in the coming weeks.
After 11 days of sniping that began with Mr.
Pataki's victory, the call appeared to signal at least a thaw in the chilled relationship.


How the Last Emperors Dressed and Furnished
An exhibition of garments and household furnishings from China's Qing Dynasty is on view through April 30 at the Textile Museum in Washington, D.C.
The 75 pieces on display in "Rugs and Textiles of Late Imperial China" are highlights from the museum's collection of antique Chinese carpets and Qing textiles, augmented by items on loan from private collections.
In assembling what was to become China's last empire, the Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) expanded beyond the Great Wall to the west and north, encompassing people of diverse ethnic origins, languages and religious beliefs, as well as disparate textile traditions.


A Conviction For Murder Is Set Aside
Twelve years after he was sentenced to death for the murder of a police officer here, a Mexican whose claims of innocence were backed by his Government has had his conviction set aside.
Calling the actions of the police and prosecutors "outrageous," a Federal judge here on Tuesday ordered Texas to give the Mexican, 32-year-old Ricardo Aldape Guerra, a new trial or to release him.


Journeys of the Spirit, For $18 a Day Plus Faith
Believers in an afterlife have always operated pretty much on faith.
But as more and more people are revived from what appears to be death, the view from the other side is becoming clearer.
So it was that a number of the participants at the Whole Life Expo gathered at a Manhattan hotel this weekend to listen to people who said they had traveled beyond the pale and returned to praise the experience.

Keeping Tabs on Japan
To the Editor:
I read Karl Taro Greenfeld's "Speed Tribes," then took note of your reviewer's unflattering comments -- and wondered if we'd read the same book.
I've traveled to Japan, written about it and try to keep up with current trends.
I can't think of a single recent work, fiction or otherwise, that more vividly captures the sensibility of contemporary Japan.

Black, Male and, Yes, a Supermodel
THELMA GOLDEN, the curator of "Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art," the new exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, sounds more like a college cheerleader than a cultural critic on the subject of Tyson Beckford.
"All I want to do is talk about Tyson," she said.
"He's the only model in my book these days."
Ms. Golden has a somewhat surprising explanantion for her enthusiasm.

Federal Court Expansion Plan May Grow Again, Judge Says

Now the judge representing the court on the project says that wrangling between two Federal agencies may mean the courthouse needs to be even larger.

The Executive Life; Stage Fright Is Nothing Compared With This
"IT'S a combination of quantum mechanics, Murphy's Law and karma," Andrew J. Shinnick said.
"The more technologically complicated you make your presentation, the greater the chances of it going south on you."
Mr.
Shinnick was talking about an experience common to anyone who makes or attends business presentations these days: the expensive, high-technology speech that lapses into embarrassed silence when some vital piece of hardware or software crashes.


Bigotry at Bryn Mawr
To the Editor:
In the otherwise judicious and careful review of my book "The Power and Passion of M. Carey Thomas" (Oct. 16), there is a point that needs clarification.
It is true that I give careful attention to Thomas's anti-Semitism, but where such grave matters are at issue, it is important that the record be completely accurate.
While Thomas consistently opposed the hiring of Jewish teachers at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, it was only in the 20th century that she prevented Jews from joining the faculty of Bryn Mawr College.
Indeed, in 1891, in what I describe as a "decidedly advanced step for an American liberal arts college," Thomas hired a Jew, the German physiologist Jacques Loeb.

In Transcript, A New Spin From Simpson
The O. J. Simpson case took another unexpected turn today with the publication of excerpts from a sealed transcript of Mr.
Simpson's interrogation by police officers after his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald L. Goldman, were murdered.
The excerpts included an assertion by Mr.
Simpson that he was a battered spouse.
The transcript of the police interrogation on June 13 was sold for an undisclosed amount to Star magazine, a weekly tabloid.
The excerpts were also published today in The New York Post and The Daily News.
The Star said it would publish the excerpts on Monday.

Two-Way Telephones Come to the Skies
You can run or you can fly, but you can't hide.
Many airlines are now offering in-flight phone services that allow people on the ground to reach travelers in the air.
That is a new wrinkle for a 10-year-old service that until recently worked only from the air to the ground.


A Health Care Windmill
To the Editor:
Don Quixote tilted at windmills, imagining they were dragons.
Some would-be slayers of rising health care costs have found their own windmills -- in the form of medical technology.
"The 'Hillary Factor' in Health Care," (At Work, Oct. 16), for example, says that technology "is an inexorable inflator of costs." That statement is not only misleading; it's just plain wrong.


'Emblematic Rant of the 60's'
WHEN MICHAEL O'DONoghue, once a prolific writer for National Lampoon and "Saturday Night Live," died on Nov. 9 at the age of 54, a rare comic voice was quieted.
Known for his sardonic, black humor, he once pointed out to Timothy White, now the editor of Billboard, that his comedy was about "the tortured little shadow areas we hide from ourselves." According to Marilyn Miller, who worked with Mr.
O'Donoghue, "his voice was the emblematic rant of the 60's." Here are samples of his wit.
In an attempt to modernize its services, the Roman Catholic Church has introduced something new into Communion.
In addition to dispensing the host, priests will now also dispense a "co-host," which symbolizes the body of Mike Douglas. -- Censored "Weekend Update" segment from "Saturday Night Live"


In Plane's Black Boxes, An Abundance of Clues
The display on the computer screen looks like a game: the middle shows the view out the cockpit window, and around the edges are controls showing altitude, airspeed and such.
But there are no sound effects; there is no joystick or fun.
The screen depicts a real flight, one that ended with a crash that killed more than 250 people.
The animation, which can be run showing the plane from any angle, sped up or slowed down or even run in reverse, was generated in the computers of the National Transportation Safety Board from data recovered from the doomed plane's "black box." The animation is one of a stunning array of tools that are emerging for the investigation of crashes and lesser incidents as computers move into aircraft around the world.


Owning Success
To the Sports Editor:
Bruce Mays's suggestion that the players become the owners of major league baseball ("800 Men In: Make the Players the Owners," The Times, Oct. 16) was intriguing.
It contained an inaccuracy about employee ownership, however.
Mays writes that successful employee ownership companies are the exception to the rule.
Hardly.
In fact, research consistently shows that employee ownership improves corporate performance.
The more than 10,000 companies in the United States with employee ownership plans tended to be more successful when they set up their plans, and they have become more successful still after.

Debra J. Simon, John D. Schreiber
Debra Joyce Simon, the director of event marketing at the Children's Television Workshop, is to be married today to John Douglas Schreiber, a producer of entertainment events.
The couple work in New York.
Rabbi Daniel Alder is to perform the ceremony at the Brotherhood Synagogue in New York.
The bride, 36, graduated from Rutgers University.
She is the daughter of Frieda Simon of Edison N.J., and the late Arthur Simon.


Autumn's Long-Lasting Fruit of the Vine
ALTHOUGH the big time for decorative pumpkin faces has gone by, the season for other distinguished members of the clan has arrived.
Pumpkins belong to a rather special group of plants called the gourd family, which also includes such diverse edibles as cucumbers, watermelons and cantaloupes as well as squash and, of course, decorative gourds.


U.N. Authorizes Attacks On Serb Bases in Croatia
The Security Council today authorized NATO to attack airfields in a Serbian-held area of Croatia if the Serbs continue to use them to launch bombing runs against targets in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The resolution, adopted unanimously, apparently does not specifically allow retaliation for attacks that have already taken place, like the one today by Serbian fighter-bombers on Cazin in northwestern Bosnia.


Word for Word/Fernando Henrique Cardoso; Having Left Campus for the Arena, Winner in Brazil Shifts to Right
IF Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's President-elect, had run for office in the United States, his opponent would have had a field day dredging up his past.
A leftist, though hardly revolutionary, professor who cited Marx and criticized the West when it was fashionable in the 1960's and 1970's, Mr.
Cardoso left a wealth of material for dissection, especially the book "Dependency and Development in Latin America," a seminal text still used in American graduate schools as a period piece on political mood of the 60's and 70's.


BEHIND THE WHEEL/Honda Odyssey; Another Shuttle in the Space Race
AS a longtime Honda fan, I have been looking forward to the company's new mini-van.
Now that it is finally in the driveway, I am both pleased and not so pleased.
The 1995 van, named the Odyssey, is based on the popular Honda Accord, and it carries the Accord's four-cylinder engine, which means it is somewhat underpowered.
On the other hand, it is smaller than much of the competition, and its handling is definitely more carlike.

Magazine/Section 6
A special issue of the Magazine asks "What's New York the capital of now?" It's a city in which density is destiny.
A concentration of creativity has made New York a capital of advertising, art, book publishing, classical music, and that just takes you through "c." Another answer to the question: diversity.

In Gaza, Outbursts Of Fury, Not Blood
On a street they had strewn with rocks and stone barricades, a group of schoolchildren held an impromptu protest march today, holding a ragged Palestinian flag.
"Oh martyrs, oh wounded, your blood has not been shed in vain!" they chanted, their voices lost in the rumble of passing cars.


Honesty in Labor
To the Sports Editor:
We got the treat and next year we'll get the trick.
I am stunned that one league came to its senses and decided to play, but was this a wise move?
The National Basketball Association's aloofness to the collective bargaining woes of its baseball and hockey contemporaries may be a sign of the real trouble that looms ahead.
Hockey and baseball players may be too dumb to kiss and make up, but they're honest.
Basketball appears to be overly optimistic in their assessment of negotiation possibilities.
Unfortunately for fans, the N.B.A. may be painting a picture bound to fall down next year without hard-line concessions.

Police Focus on Arresting Prostitutes' Customers
The undercover police officer, clad in tight mini-skirt, fish-net stockings and high heels, strolled to the passenger window of a white Lincoln Town Car and talked briefly with the driver.
They agreed on a price for sex as police officers nearby listened to their recorded conversation.
Before the man could flinch, a dozen officers swarmed over him like a bees to a hive.
Several others converged on the scene in screeching cars from every direction.
Shaking visibly, the man, Magry Zakhary of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, was handcuffed and whisked to a waiting van.

STRANGE PILGRIMS: Twelve Stories By Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

Most of these tales do not reflect the trademark magic realism of their author, a Nobel laureate, but reality itself.
Featuring Latin Americans who have resettled in Europe, they are inspired by Mr.
Garcia Marquez's youth.
Last year our reviewer, William Boyd, said, "As always . . . the marvel is his tone of voice."


Giving Credit Where Due
To the Editor:
As director of public relations for the Film Society of Lincoln Center, I feel obliged to point out that in the article "How the Nazis Created a Dream Factory in Hell"  [ Nov. 6 ] , in connection with the series of German films of the Nazi era, currently at the Walter Reade Theater, the name of the man who conceived and curated the series was not mentioned.
Eric Rentschler, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, and one of the leading experts in German film history, programmed the traveling show and is also the author of a book, "The Ministry of Illusion: German Film 1933-45," to be published next year by Harvard University Press.

WHY LAWYERS LIE
Floyd Abrams's "Why Lawyers Lie" (Oct. 9) might leave readers thinking that lawyers, and particularly criminal-defense lawyers, routinely lie and that it is their duty to do so on behalf of their clients.
This is not the case.
While lawyers must zealously defend the accused, their duty does not extend to lying or permitting known perjured testimony to be offered from the witness stand.
The American legal system focuses on process, not the truth.
That is how it was designed and how it is supposed to operate.
Why are coerced confessions and illegally seized evidence suppressed if a person committed a crime?
Because legal processes have been subverted and that is unjust under our system of law.
Defense lawyers promote justice by insuring that the evidence to be used against their clients is legally obtained and that it meets the necessary burden of proof.


Going Back To the Source
To the Editor:
In her article "John and Woody and Mary-Louise and Mia"  [ Oct. 23 ] , Ellen Pall noted that the actor John Cusack was concerned about being compared to Woody Allen in Mr.
Allen's latest film, "Bullets Over Broadway," and quoted him as saying, "Because then I thought I didn't create a character." His comment reminded me of my favorite line of all time, from another Allen film, "The Purple Rose of Cairo." In it, Jeff Daniels portrays an actor whose character has gotten away from him, and he indignantly tells a fan: "He's my character. I created him." She replies, "Didn't the man who wrote the movie do that?" EILEEN ELDRICH  New York


CHARLES MURRAY
I guess the upside for those of us on the lower end of Charles Murray's I.Q. ladder is that we don't have to take responsibility for -- oh, let's see: acid rain, radioactive waste, smog, ozone depletion, World Wars I and II, the atom bomb, germ warfare, water pollution, the Exxon Valdez, slavery, genocide, mercury in fish, the cold war, apartheid, the Vietnam War, Agent Orange, etc. etc.


411 Service Out of Order
Telephone users in the New York metropolitan area had to resort to looking up numbers the old-fashioned way -- in the telephone book -- when an electronic malfunction caused the 411 directory assistance service to crash yesterday.
Bob Varettoni, a spokesman for NYNEX, which operates the system, said the problem was caused by the failure of a routing circuit that allows two computer databases to communicate.
He said he did not know what caused the circuits to fail.


Taxpayers Are Angry. They're Expensive, Too.
AMERICANS believe that their Government wastes vast wads of cash on pork-barrel highways, naval bases in the landlocked home states of important Senators and handouts to an ungrateful underclass -- and that wiping out all this would balance the budget.
After the election of 1994, few Republicans or even Democrats deny that the voters have a point.


Quirky Storm Now Has Lost Some Bluster
The peripatetic Tropical Storm Gordon, which harried Cuba, Haiti, Florida and North Carolina's Outer Banks before it turned south last night, began breaking up today off the north Florida coast.
In 10 days of existence, the storm has proved as fickle in intensity as in its zigzag course.
As a tropical storm, it killed hundreds of people when it hit Cuba and Haiti early this week.
On Wednesday, it weakened, but nevertheless cut a swath across Florida that caused $200 million in damage.

Help for the Transportationally Challenged
STEPPING out of my building the other day I came this close to being run down by a man delivering food on a bicycle.
I never saw him until he brushed past, and I don't think he ever saw me.
He was too busy cackling and gesticulating at another food deliveryman in the street.
They were racing.
I didn't scream this time and give chase.
I simply visited Charles Komanoff, my transportation therapist.
He sighed.
"This is one group of bicycle riders I have not been able to reach. Part of the problem is that many of them don't speak English. And when I go to their stores and restaurants, suddenly their managers don't speak English, either."


50's-Style Diner Takes Root in, of All Places, a Shopping Mall
A BROTHER and a sister from Caldwell are trying to turn back time a bit by creating a 50's-style diner in a space that used to be a bank.
While there are a few other retro diners scattered around the state, theirs, called Bobby-Q's, is in the Livingston Mall here and may be the only one in a shopping mall in the state.
"That's really the first I've heard of any diner in any mall in New Jersey," said Larry Fidel, executive vice president of the New Jersey Restaurant Association in Somerset.
The organization represents 1,400 restaurant owners in the state and was originally the Newark Diners Association when it was formed in 1942.


UMass Grapples With Games And Grades
Lou Roe heard the pitches and listened to his dreams.
His game was offering all these paths from Atlantic City, and all he had to do was choose one.
These were big-time basketball places in prime-time leagues.
Syracuse had a place at center stage in the Carrier Dome.
Connecticut had become a national program.
Florida State and Clemson were interested.
He chose none of them.
When Lou Roe finally made his decision and told his friends he was headed for this place called UMass, the responses held more skepticism than congratulations.
There had to be some mistake.
"UMass didn't sound like University of Massachusetts," Roe remembered.
"Maybe a technical school or something. People didn't really know. They were like, 'What's wrong? What was on your mind when you made that decision? What made you choose UMass over Syracuse? Are you nuts? Who is UMass, anyway?' "


What's New York the Capital of Now?: Talent; If You Dropped A Bomb On These Pages...
THE PATTERN HAS BECOME FAMILIAR: A PAINTER MOVES TO NEW York from a distant precinct, eats beans and rice for six years, gets a gallery, gets a solo show, gets a bigger gallery, sells a painting for $300,000 and then . . . moves out of New York.
To Sag Harbor, maybe.
Actors go to Hollywood.
Writers to Wyoming.
The talent business has taken a beating in New York.
Dancers have watched rehearsal studios go co-op; painters have watched their SoHo spaces turn over at SoHo prices.
For a few very fertile years in the 1970's, New York spawned a legion of great rock bands (the New York Dolls, the Ramones, Talking Heads et al.); these days, such a scene is more likely to break out in Chapel Hill, N.C., where your van doesn't get broken into every night and where there's always another frat party to play.


Penn State Defense Provides Offense
Reduced to cheerful, if impatient, spectators for all but six minutes, Penn State's offense spent today's first half doing needlepoint and sending out for pizza while the Nittany Lions' defense played fantasy football against Northwestern.
Free safeties fulfilled their end-zone dreams, defensive ends chugged along with interceptions, cornerbacks scooped up fumbles as if they were Easter eggs.


What's New York The Capital Of Now?
The classic New York Answer to the question is, of course, the world, but these days it sounds a little dated.
When I hear it, I think of Dick Falk, who used to work in a dingy office above Times Square and billed himself as Broadway's greatest press agent.
He loved to boast that he was the model for Sidney Falco, the 1950's P.R. man played by Tony Curtis in "Sweet Smell of Success," and it was hard to decide which was more endearing: that he wanted to associate himself with one of the most reptilian characters in the history of film, or that his boast was a blatant lie.
When I met him, three years ago, he was 79 and his business had dwindled to a few clients, among them a "psychic to the stars" and an actress named Suzie Sunshine.
One afternoon, as he was in the process of being evicted from his office, he sat at his desk in front of his manual typewriter showing off yellowed Walter Winchell columns and explaining his world view.
"To me, 42d Street is the most beautiful street in the world!" he declared with a booming voice and a straight face.
"It's the center of the earth, and I'm it! I'm actually 42d Street!"

KILL FOR LIFE
How about a profile on the people who are hunted by McMillan and his friends?
My sister, for example, whose family practice clinic was fire-bombed at 3 A.M., on Oct. 11.
The clinic provided, among other medical services, birth control and abortion.
She has been a physican's assistant for 18 years and recently got a master's degree in counseling.
She's been a care giver all her life.
Ever since she was a child, those in need have known they could turn to her for help.


Law, Conducting and Mathematics in One Package
WE began at 10:30 in the morning on the Saturday of the Labor Day Weekend in the Paradise Diner, Sag Harbor's "greasy spoon," reminiscent of the places in the city where the lawyer, conductor, mathematician Stefan Bauer-Mengelberg might occasionally meet a client before going on to dinner at a setting just slightly more elegant.
We moved through the day as he talked, gesticulating nonstop as if he were still conducting some invisible orchestra, first out to the Sag Harbor pier -- "and I do often meet a client on a jetty or a small strip of beach," he was saying in the kind of aside that so often would come in between his lines, this lawyer who practices without an office or a secretary or an answering machine, partly to spare his clients overhead, partly because he never meant to be a practicing lawyer, not really.


Diner Beware
To the Editor: We were dining at U Zlate Hrusky, the Golden Pear, in Prague last month.
Bread and butter were placed on the table and we had ordered our wine when the waiter came with a one-inch (one-ounce) tiny jar of snail pate.
He offered it; we declined, but he encouraged us to try it and left it on the table.
There was no mention of price, and we simply assumed it was complimentary.
My husband ended up opening it and taking a little taste.
Our bill for dinner and wine was the equivalent of $80, but the pate was $40 in addition.
When we complained, we were treated very rudely and firmly, with no adjustment offered.


The View From an Unmarked Car
AN hour or so after dawn on a cloudy fall day, State Police Trooper First Class Richard W. Dorsch was driving an unmarked cruiser cautiously southbound on Interstate 95 in Greenwich, watching other cars zoom along and offering wry comments.
"There's a lot of wackos riding around in cars," said the trooper, who is of a philosophical bent.
"I guess it's the hustle and bustle of life. It's chaos. It's a hurry to go nowhere."


The Rise of the Losing Class
WHEN Karl Marx described an increasingly miserable and exploited working class, he never imagined that his oppressed workers might someday include Ivy League M.B.A's tossed out of $200,000-a-year jobs.
But a changing economy is gradually linking highly educated managers and technicians with high-school- trained assembly-line workers and office clerks.
The link is in their common place in an increasingly competitive economy that no longer values workers as much as it once did.
What they share, public opinion polls show, are feelings of uncertainty, insecurity and anxiety about their jobs and their incomes.

Shoestring Italy

How refreshing to read about a shoestring tour of Italy by real people who don't need four-star restaurants or sumptuous hotel appointments to be able to enjoy themselves! ("A Group Tour of Italy, Czech Style," Oct. 23.)


Training Board Members
MEMBERSHIP organizations that serve co-ops or condominiums have long believed that special training for those serving on boards is so basic to a well-functioning building or complex that they've made education a key component of their programs.
Yet board members, it seems, are less and less inclined to devote time to training that they feel lacks a payoff.


Sampras Springs! Agassi Falls
Just how much did Pete Sampras want to beat Andre Agassi today in the semifinals of the IBM/ATP Tour World Championship?
Consider this: Leading by 5-3 in a second-set tie breaker he had to win to stay in the match, the top-ranked Sampras finished off one of the week's most remarkable exchanges by sprinting desperately to his left, lunging and knocking a backhand winner down the line.
Sampras, usually among the most sedate and unflappable of 23-year-olds, jumped higher than a freshman cheerleader at the first homecoming game.


Class Puts The Accent On Clarity
ARMANDO MOLINA speaks in the gently accented tones of his native Mexico.
He was an English teacher before immigrating to the United States 12 years ago, but the lessons he taught dealt only with grammar and vocabulary --"the basic stuff," he calls it -- and not with ordinary conversational English.
That, said Mr.
Molina, a bilingual counselor at the Westchester Spanish Coalition, a nonprofit social services organization in White Plains, was something he had to teach himself in America.
It has been a daunting task given his perfectionism and a job that requires him to speak in public.
After years of worrying about his mistakes of pronunciation and usage, Mr.
Molina said he finally found a class that has helped him -- a free, eight-week course to reduce accents given at the Donald R. Reed Speech Center, an independent, nonprofit agency on the grounds of Phelps Memorial Hospital Center here.


Out of Ashes


Streetscapes/Blumstein's Department Store; How a Black Boycott Opened the Employment Door
THE angry demonstrations on 125th Street are over, the displaced vendors relocated to a vacant lot on Lenox Avenue between 116th and 117th Streets.
Last month the vendors were fighting for the right to sell outside the street's stores and began boycotting local merchants who opposed the congestion that sometimes blocked the sidewalks.
Somewhere there must be a few ancient Harlemites who can remember similar demonstrations 60 years ago in front of Blumstein's department store, at 230 West 125th Street.
At that time blacks were fighting for the right to work not outside, but inside, and their victory marked a turning point in Harlem history.


Looking Like Winners, But Acting Like Browns
Art Modell, the Browns' owner and president, doesn't want to get too excited about his team's 8-2 start -- the best since 1965.
But it's hard when all the signs indicate that the team is very good and the record is no aberration.
The Browns are tied with San Diego for the best record in the American Football Conference and for home-field advantage for the playoffs.


An Ignorance of Africa As Vast as the Continent
FOR any American living in this city of gleaming skyscrapers and seamless asphalt highways, there is bound to be at least one encounter with another countryman who, roughing it elsewhere on the continent, says of Abidjan: "Of course, that's not really Africa."
By the same token, many American blacks who have spent time in African countries find themselves contending back home with the wide-eyed inquiries of friends or strangers who have never visited but see Africa as an idealized spiritual home of brotherhood and democracy.


Business Diary: November 13-18
THE ECONOMY The Fed Wants to Make One Thing Perfectly Clear  So the Federal Reserve did raise rates again -- by three-quarters of a point, the most since 1981.
The right move?
Many had doubts.
Complaints ranged from the polite ("misreading the American economy," "extraordinarily aggressive") to the less polite (the Fed "is coming down on the side of the bloody bondholders").
After all, the latest reading on consumer prices showed just a 0.1 percent rise.
But economists, it seems, have this odd formula that equates "full employment" with a 6 percent jobless rate.
Anything less (it's now 5.8 percent) means we're "running out of workers." Put another way: workers get this funny idea that there are plenty of jobs around, and (gasp!) demand more pay.
The result: demon inflation.
The short view, of course, would dictate putting people to work.
The Fed's taking the long view -- correctly, one hopes.

Taking the Plunge Into a Reef Off Fiji
The Great Astrolabe Reef, off Fiji in the South Pacific, is known as one of the world's finest dive sites.
This spring, the Beqa Princess will explore its outer, or northern, section -- which the company says has been closed to diving in recent years to protect its delicate ecology.
The reef is known for its coral and its sheer dropoffs, but its biggest attraction is the chance it affords to view big schools of open-ocean hunters like manta rays, barracuda, dolphins, billfish marlin and whales.
The boat's operator, the San Francisco-based Aqua-Trek Dive Travel Service, received permission to dive at the site because it had been in Fiji previously and shown sensitivity to protecting the underwater environment, according to Les Fields, the company's managing director.
In its agreement with the local people, Aqua-Trek will photograph the reef to document damage from cyclones.
The Beqa Princess will carry no more than six divers, two to a cabin.


Scaffolding Leaving the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. More to Come.
An update from one of the world's longest-running construction projects: the scaffolding will be coming down -- for now, at least.
Since 1982, scaffolding has surrounded the south tower of the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine, on Amsterdam Avenue just north of 110th Street.
It is a visual reminder that, after 102 years, the world's largest Gothic cathedral, still deserves its nickname: St.
John the Unfinished.

Latest Rate Hike by the Fed Makes White House Nervous
The first five times the Federal Reserve raised interest rates this year, the Clinton Administration was surprisingly accepting.
But last week's big increase produced a more varied reaction, leading to worries and irritation among some of the Administration's most senior economic officials.
The concern at top levels of the Administration is that the Fed's actions this time may begin to threaten the 31/2 -year-old economic expansion that must continue through 1996 if the President is to have any serious chance of winning re-election.
A top policy maker, who insisted on anonymity, called the rate increase "a more marginal decision on the part of the Fed" than the central bank's previous interest rate moves.


Governor-Elect's Loyal Aide Likes the Sidelines, Away From the Crowd
When Governor-elect George E. Pataki met reporters one day after the election, he brought only one member of his campaign staff on stage: his loyal aide and campaign chairman, Michael C. Finnegan.
But if the move said much about Mr.
Pataki's feelings for his old friend, the place Mr.
Finnegan took on stage also said much about their relationship: He stood in the wings, barely noticed by the crowd.


Lori Oscher, Eric J. Friedman
Lori Oscher, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs Paul E. Oscher of Harrison, N.Y., was married last evening to Eric Jonathan Friedman, the son of Dr. and Mrs.
Robert W. Friedman of Oceanside, L.I.
Rabbi Daniel S. Wolk performed the ceremony at the University Club in New York.
The bride, 25, graduated from Cornell University and is a swimwear designer with Nicole Miller, the clothing manufacturer in New York.
Her father is the chief executive of Crooks, Oscher &amp; Company, a specialist firm and stock brokerage in New York.


Park of Vistas to Improve Looks
Henry J. Stern, the city's Parks Commissioner, was in an expansive mood.
"It is unique because of its vistas," Mr.
Stern mused as he stood before several tons of upturned dirt in Maurice Park last week.
"On a clear day, you can see the Empire State Building."


Keeping Tabs on Japan
To the Editor:
There are too many misstatements in the review of my book, "Speed Tribes" (Oct. 16), for me to refute, but please allow me to cite a few examples:


Despite Gains, Press Freedom in Mexico Is Still Limited
Millions of Mexicans who watched President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's last state of the union address on television this month heard him declare that press freedom exists in Mexico.
"The proliferation of completely uncensored opinions and investigations is there for all to see," he said.


Julia A. Forster, John Thompson Jr.
Julia Allen Forster, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Christopher A. Forster of New York, was married there yesterday to John Edward Thompson Jr., the son of the late Mr. and Mrs.
Thompson.
Dr.
Richard P. Unsworth, a Presbyterian minister and the headmaster of the Berkshire School in Sheffield, Mass., performed the ceremony at the Church of the Holy Trinity, and the Rev.
Herbert G. Draesel Jr., an Episcopal priest, took part in it.
Ms.
Forster, 34, is keeping her name.
She is the director of patron programs for WNET, Channel 13, in New York.
She graduated from Hartwick College.


Nov. 13-19: Just Say No; California's Propostion 187 Meets First Legal Roadblock
The fight over California's hotly disputed immigration control measure did not end on Election Day when voters gave it overwhelming 3-to-2 approval.
Opponents last week won a temporary reprieve in court.


Pataki Names Task Force to Cut Budget
Governor-elect George E. Pataki announced the formation yesterday of a key committee in his transition: a task force to hire a new budget director and put the new governor's stamp on next year's budget.
Heading the group of 10 people will be Assemblyman John J. Faso, a five-term Republican from Kinderhook who abandoned his run for state comptroller earlier this year after the party chose Herbert I. London as its candidate.
Mr.
Faso, 42, who has emerged as a top spokesman for the Republicans in the Democratic-controlled Assembly, said a priority would be to look for cuts in the $34 billion state-financed portion of the budget.


More Parking, but More Dirt
There are two things that residents of northern Brooklyn will fight for only slightly less hard than, for example, their lives.
One is their right to a view of the Manhattan skyline; the other is a parking space.
Under a proposal by the Department of Sanitation, the perpetual parking shortage will ease at least slightly on some blocks, though the price may be clean streets.


He Sure Didn't Take It With Him
OF course, the very rich are different from you and me. Their wills are longer.
And no recent will, lawyers believe, has run on longer than the 120-page tome filed on Monday in New York County Surrogate Court for the late Milton J. Petrie, founder and majority owner of Petrie Stores.


Teen-Agers at Malls: Some Background
The recent portrait painted of teen-agers as nuisances in our malls (Freehold Township Journal, "Teen-Agers at the Mall: An Uneasy Existence") is incomplete without an examination of the places this generation has been excluded from.
Single-parent families and even some two-parent households where both parents work have become so pressed for time that the very essence of family life, sharing experiences with one another, has been sacrificed for making ends meet and, after a certain age, that electronic baby-sitter loses its appeal.


Lori E. Jacobson And Peter C. Jarck
Lori Elizabeth Jacobson, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
James A. Jacobson of New York, was married there yesterday to Peter Carl Jarck, a son of Ingrid Eifert of Honesdale, Pa., and a stepson of Klaus Eifert.
The Rev.
Mark S. Anschutz performed the Episcopal ceremony at St.
James's Church.

The bride's grandfather was the late New York restaurateur Toots Shor.


Cochlear Implants And the Young
The cochlear implant has proven to be a useful device for some profoundly deafened individuals.
The article "Enabling the Deaf to Hear: Surgery That Cuts Two Ways" (Oct. 9), while informative, failed to emphasize one important aspect.
Individuals who are deafened at birth or in infancy before learning speech (prelingual) predictably have limited benefit from the cochlear implant if it is placed in late adolescence or adulthood.
For all intents and purposes these people have never heard sound.

Support Seen For New Term For Cortines
Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines has the support of most of the Board of Education for an extension of his two-year contract, board members say.
Now the question is whether Mr.
Cortines wants to stay.
Mr.
Cortines has kept his own intentions a tantalizing mystery.
Even as he has repeatedly broadened his already sweeping agenda in recent months, taking on projects that will have barely gotten under way when his contract expires on July 1, Mr.
Cortines has also occasionally hinted that he may retire.
That has left open the prospect that the city could face its sixth wrenching chancellor search in a decade.


What All Alzheimer's Disease Families Share
To the Editor:
There are approximately four million people with Alzheimer's disease in this country, and for every victim there is also a care giver.
I am one of those care givers, and I believe I know how Nancy Reagan must feel now that her husband has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
I know what to expect.


Indonesia Bars Foreign Reporters In East Timor
As the police struggled to restore order in East Timor after the largest anti-Government demonstrations in years, the Indonesian Government said today that it would temporarily bar foreign reporters from visiting the disputed province.
The move alarmed human rights groups, which have warned of a new, violent crackdown on dissidents in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and later annexed.


Advise and Compensate
To the Editor:
When I first entered the consulting field, I would do work that involved sharing the risk in the form of a percentage of savings for the client.
Unfortunately, there would usually be a difference over the size of the savings or whether the savings were attained by the client or by the consultant.
When one works, one fully expects to receive compensation.
Clients hire a consultant for skills and experience that are missing from their organizations or because their staffs are overburdened.
Our firm always delivers value-added services, but it is up to the client to use our recommendations wisely and be prepared to implement recommendations if they wish to move forward.
EDWARD FORREST  Roslyn, L.I., Oct. 25  The writer is president of Productivity Consulting Limited, a management consulting firm.

No Ewing, No Problem For a Night
The Knicks did not have Patrick Ewing in the lineup because of a sore knee, but they still had enough to end their slump.
Returning to form after a 1-3 road trip, New York (5-3) rolled to a 26-point lead in the second quarter, then held off the Atlanta Hawks, 92-79, last night at Madison Square Garden.
Ewing missed the game because of soreness and swelling in his right knee.


Scalia v. Merriam-Webster
IN A 1924 DISSENT, Justice Louis D. Brandeis wrote: "Modification implies growth. It is the life of the law." The law got pretty lively recently on the meaning of the word modify.
Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court's conservative dynamo and frequent dissenter, found himself writing the majority's decision in the case of MCI v.
AT&amp;T.
This case, pitting two of the nation's info-age giants against each other, hinged on the reach of the Federal Communications Commission's power to "modify any requirement" in a section of the law.
MCI argued that this meant the F.C.C. could make basic changes in that section, which it had made over AT&amp;T's objections.

LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
A Kitchen's Own Cow
A COW on the roof is not equal to a bull in the street.
At least not in Smithtown.
For decades Smithtown's bronzed bull has guarded the intersection of Routes 25 and 25A with nary an incident.
All right, there was the time vandals spray-painted its private parts pink.
That caused the Town Board to discuss castrating the sculpture, which led a member of the Smith family to stand up and shout, "There will be no castration without representation!" Democracy prevailed.
The bull has remained intact, and in high regard.


V.A.T. Prevalent, Refunds Less So
SWITZERLAND is joining the 19 European countries that charge a value added tax, or V.A.T., on goods and services.
The tax, the equivalent of a national sales tax, goes into effect Jan. 1, and the rate is 6.5 percent.
It applies to things that concern tourists: accommodations, car rentals and restaurant meals, as well as goods purchased to be taken home.
It will not be applied to theater tickets, according to Erika Lieben, public relations manager for the Swiss National Tourist Office in New York.
The new tax, described as a consumption tax, will replace a purchase tax of 4.5 to 4.8 percent that now applies, but only to merchandise.
Despite the rise, the 6.5 percent rate is the lowest in Europe, where the levels run up to 25 percent in Denmark, 21 percent in Ireland, 18.6 percent in France and 17.5 percent in the Netherlands and Britain.


Scienceport Museum Finds a Place to Land Temporarily
SCIENCEPORT, the museum that aims to reveal the secrets of this world and of the universe beyond, has performed a neat physical trick: After three years of virtual invisibility in the county, Scienceport has materialized at the old Eastview School here with a flourish worthy of Houdini.
Not that the museum, which was founded in 1991 by the Council of Junior Leagues of Westchester and incorporated in the same year by the State Board of Regents, has been inactive.
Although it still awaits its dream building at the county-owned Playland in Rye, Scienceport has been busy in the schools.
The museum administers Starlab, an astronomy workshop featuring a portable planetarium, and Science-by-Mail, a pen-pal program that pairs fourth through ninth graders with professional scientists.


Roll Right On In
At Mr.
Chips, an ice-cream parlor at 22 East 92d Street, fresh red lettering on the door proclaims: "Roller Blades Welcome." The shop sits under a pink awning in the heart of the Upper East Side.
Inside, the aroma of baked waffle cones clings to the air.
There are swivel stools in peach and mint green, including short ones for smaller customers.
Mr.
Chips was opened in September by Chip Fisher, the son of the electronics tycoon Avery Fisher.
"I'm 38 years old and I go all over town in my Roller Blades," he said.
"I'm just really angry that you can't get into any stores." Most merchants, Mr.
Fisher said, fear litigation.
"If someone falls in my store," he said with an optimism unusual in a New Yorker, "I'll tell them they don't know how to skate, but I don't think they will sue me." D.M.H.


The Executive Computer; Getting On-Line -- the Microsoft Way
AT the Comdex computer show last week in Las Vegas, the Microsoft Corporation gave the first public demonstration of its planned on-line service, which is to debut next year.
And in typical fashion, Microsoft immediately set out to rewrite the rules of a game it hasn't even started to play.
Called the Microsoft Network, it resembles other on-line services like America Online, Prodigy and Compuserve.
Users will be able to send electronic messages, get technical support they can no longer get over the phone, look up words in far-away data bases and yak it up with strangers.
Or shop for socks.
Or exchange mail with the White House, and read about Socks (the First Cat).

Deep-Pocket Braves Set a Budget
The Atlanta Braves have nine players signed for the 1995 season (what 1995 season, you ask?) at a total of $30 million.
That's more than 11 teams spent, or would have spent without the strike, on their entire payrolls this year, but the Braves don't plan to break Ted Turner's bank.
"Actually, we have our own internal budget, which has been the admonition of agents and players, especially in the last three months," John Schuerholz, the Braves' general manager, said.
"We've taken their words to heart. They all said you don't need any kind of cap; all you have to do is set up a budget. So we're going to do that."

A Hampstead Socialist Tackles Schwarzenegger
Emma Thompson IS SO intelligent, so articulate, so politically aware that it seems only logical to assume that her choice of roles is quite deliberate.
So how has she -- this ironic, sensual and frank 35-year-old woman -- come to represent the American fantasy of Englishness, as a stiff-upper-lip, Merchant-Ivory kind of person who subordinates passion to duty?
She laughs.
"Really, what you're describing is 'The Remains of the Day.' The question is, what roles are there? What stories are you really interested in?" Good parts for women are rare, she says, and in comedy even rarer.
That's why, with delight, she accepted the invitation last year to make "Junior," a fantasy opening on Wednesday about male pregnancy, with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito.
The team, which includes the director Ivan Reitman, also made "Twins" back in 1988.

Dear Diary: About Those Earthquakes
EMMA THOMPSON, A veteran of Shakespeare and Merchant Ivory films, has her first leading role in a Hollywood film in "Junior," which opens on Wednesday.
Directed by Ivan Reitman, the Universal film also stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a scientist who, through an experiment, becomes pregnant and Danny DeVito as his obstetrician.
While Ms.
Thompson was in California making the film, her husband, Kenneth Branagh, was editing his film "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" in England.


Carla L. Slocum, David J. Friedman
Carla Lockwood Slocum, a daughter of Jean K. Lockwood of San Antonio and the late Frederick R. Lockwood, was married last evening to David Jay Friedman, the son of Anne P. Friedman of New York and the late Maurice M. Friedman.
Justice Marylin G. Diamond of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan officiated at the Manhattan apartment of Phyllis F. Mack, the sister of the bridegroom.
The bride is a merchandise manager for men's sportswear at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch in Columbus, Ohio.

ARAFAT'S FORCES ARRANGE A TRUCE WITH MILITANTS
Struggling to rescue itself from its deepest crisis, the Palestinian self-rule government arranged a temporary truce today with Islamic militants and agreed to investigate street battles between police officers and protesters on Friday that killed at least 13 people and wounded as many as 200.
Unlike the day before, Gaza City's streets did not echo with gunfire for long hours today, although shots were heard occasionally.
Both the Palestinian Authority led by Yasir Arafat and the dominant Muslim group, Hamas, sought to pull back from the brink of what some here fear could become a civil war.


Indian Artists Speak for Themselves
A MYSTICAL aura emanates from eight "Spirit Masks" that revolve slowly with the slightest air current in the gallery of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in Lawrenceville.
Their construction is simple, the concept complex.
Lloyd E. Oxendine, a Lumbee Indian, inserted feathers into empty holes in the rims of used wooden tennis rackets and suspended turtle shells or deer skulls within the hollow frames.
"These masks are homage to all the little spirits that permeate our lives," he says in a note in the catalogue.
"The feathers represent flight and freedom; the tennis rackets relate to transformations of the mundane into the mystical. They speak of the continuity of Native American ideas in a cosmopolitan city."


A Parellel Art World, Vast and Unruly
"THERE'S NO ROOM FOR FAKERY," SAID Carol Lay, neatly drawing a line in the sand between underground comics -- her world -- and high art.
She was sitting in the living room (and studio) of her apartment in the Windsor Terrace section of Brooklyn talking about cartooning's double requirement -- drawing and writing skills -- that can make it seem even more demanding than higher art forms.
Ms.
Lay became a cartoonist after a disenchanting period studying fine art at the University of California, Los Angeles, in the early 1970's.
"Let's just say I took one too many courses in Conceptual Art," she continued, smiling only faintly.
Aline Kominsky-Crumb, one of the first women to publish in underground comics, was more blunt.
"I like the fact that I do things that people read on the toilet," she said, speaking from her house in Sauve, a small village in southern France.
"Comics are cheap and funny and throwaway. I definitely want to stay away from the pretentious end of the art world."


Arias, Art Songs And a Jazz Birthday
IT is another busy musical Sunday, with more than half a dozen classic events of note on the concert agenda, and a jazz birthday party to top off the afternoon.
At 2 o'clock, one can choose between free recitals in Westport and New Haven.
The soprano Annette Nauraine, who is from Stamford, offers a recital of arias, art songs and musical theater selections at the Westport Public Library (227-8411).
Wendy Sharp, a Yale faculty violinist, appears in a duo recital with the pianist Li-Pi Hsieh at Sprague Memorial Hall (432-4157); the program includes works of Bach, Schubert, Bloch and Wieniawski.


THE NEW YORK TIMES TOP 20
1 -- NORTH CAROLINA -- The 1993 national champions were the near-consensus preseason No. 1 last fall but failed to advance to the Sweet 16 for the first time in 13 seasons.
But senior Donald Williams is once again healthy and Jerry Stackhouse, Rasheed Wallace and the rest of the Tar Heels' stellar recruiting class of 1993 are a year older and now have something to prove.


Fine-Tuning With a Hammer
WHEN for the first time in a decade, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a startling three-quarters of a percentage point last week, there was hardly a murmur of protest from the White House or Congress.
And for an obvious reason: America's factories and offices are running at full tilt, much faster than the talking heads were predicting just a few months ago.
But lurking behind the near-consensus that it is time to rein in the economy is the disquieting reality that Washington has come to rely exclusively on the Fed to buffer the ebb and flood of economic tides.
And while the institution generally gets high marks from economists -- "It's hard to fault monetary policy in the last decade," said Benjamin M. Friedman of Harvard -- there is, arguably, a substantial price to be paid for leaving it all to the gnomes.


Author! Author! and More Author
Between hobnobbing with Robert Caro and introducing E. L. Doctorow to Walter Mosley, it has been a busy month for Bernie Wohl, executive director of the Goddard Riverside Community Center.
Besides working at the center's annual book fair and auction, he dashed to three meet-the-author dinners.
"Last week Roy Blount just picked up his book and started reading, and people were howling," said Mr.
Wohl, who saw Mr.
Blount at the Central Park West apartment of Betty Levinson. . . .
The same night, Elie Wiesel, Frederic Morton and Paul Auster entertained guests across town at the home of Andre Baeyens, the Consul General of France. . . .
Last Friday, Calvin Trillin read from his work at a gala auction at Goddard Riverside.
The dinner was catered by Katie Workman, a cookbook editor at Clarkson Potter.
Auction items included a dinner for 10 cooked by the chef Mark Strausman at Campagna.
Also on hand were Bruce Harris, executive vice president of Random House, and Peter Workman, head of Workman Publishing and Ms.
Workman's father.
He said, "It's good that the event is actually at Goddard Riverside -- it's not abstract. We're not all going off to the Plaza for a fund-raiser." J.K.B.


Few Fan Sparks as Cuba Smolders
ONE morning late in the summer exodus that became a spectacle of Cubans' desperation under Communist rule, a compact, 40-ish woman marched down a rocky beach near this city to where a group of would-be refugees was fashioning a raft from scrap lumber and old inner tubes.
"Why should we leave?" the woman demanded suddenly, stopping the work cold.
"If we are going to risk our lives in the sea, letting the sharks eat us, why not die fighting against the ruler? Did we not fight against Batista when he had a big army? Why can we not fight against Fidel, when he is killing us by not giving us food?"

It is hard to decide which aspect of Roy McMillan is more offensive: an ego huge enough to use the sensitive, difficult and private situations of women with unwanted pregnancies to gain an audience for uncivil behavior or his poorly reasoned philosophy, with no perspective beyond a "my opinion is better than yours" judgment on the motives and actions of others.


Here's Help for a No-Name Neighborhood
Two weeks ago on this page, Jonathan R. Butler offered some names for his no-name neighborhood, south of Houston and west of the Avenue of the Americas.
The City asked readers for their own suggestions.
Here is a selection:  To the Editor:


Q and A
Cycling in Ireland
Q.
I'd like to tour the west coast of Ireland by bike next year.
I can rent or ship my own bike for two weeks.
Which would be cheaper?
And what would be the best routes and the best season to view the most gardens, public and private? -- J. W. Rommel, New York, N.Y.


Crisis of Confidence For a School Team
FOR as long as anyone can remember, the vast majority of coaches of girls' high school basketball teams in the state have been men.
The same situation prevails at most universities, including the University of Connecticut.
And it is also the case in volleyball and softball.
Conversely, it is extremely rare to find a woman coaching a boys' team anywhere in the country.
Indeed, Michael Savage, the executive director of the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference could not recall an instance where a woman coached a boys' team in the state until Candy Perez became the coach of the boys' varsity basketball team at Wamogo Regional High School in Litchfield in 1989.


Sabatini Hopes to End Drought
It seems as if it has been ages since the last time Gabriela Sabatini won a tournament.
It has been two and a half years to be exact.
Today, she has a chance to end that drought.
Yesterday afternoon at Madison Square Garden, Sabatini overcame herself, as well as Kimiko Date, for a 4-6, 6-0, 6-3 victory and a trip to the final of the Virginia Slims Championships.
The 24-year-old Argentine will face an 18-year-old American, Lindsay Davenport, who crushed Mary Pierce, 6-3, 6-2, yesterday.

McNair Takes to Air For a Final Flourish
The Alcorn State Braves were hoping for a Division I-AA playoff berth when they went into their game against Jackson State today with a 7-2-1 record.
Sixteen teams will make the playoffs, and the Braves knew their chances would be good when the pairings are announced Sunday afternoon.
In fact, they improved their fortunes with a 52-34 victory as Steve (Air) McNair completed 29 of 34 passes for 533 yards and threw for 5 touchdowns.


KILL FOR LIFE
On the one hand, McMillan urges men to be "real men" (i.e. exercise their physical superiority over pregnant women who want to have an abortion) and thus "protect your child." On the other, Dr.
Smith, McMillan's wife, prescribes no birth control, leaving women with no means of avoiding potential pregnancy.
One of the failings of people like Smith and McMillan is that they insist babies be born into a world that may not want them.
McMillan may see himself as the savior of such children, while they may, at some point in their lives, wish to damn him to hell.

Alternatives to Turkey on Turkey Day
UNUSUAL Thanksgiving dinners with flair are widely available this year.
Those seeking nontraditional turkeyless meals will have no problems.
Grilled venison with green-peppercorn sauce, fillet of sole stuffed with salmon mousse and lobster sauce, roast breast of goose with holiday stuffing and lingonberry sauce, pan-roasted salmon with rock shrimp and caper-thyme butter and Chesapeake Bay jumbo lump crab cakes with red-pepper coulis compete with turkey for top billing.
Venison ($29) is one of six entrees at the Fusion Grille in East Setauket (751-2200), where cheese pumpkin soup with curried Granny Smith apples ($6.50) and pumpkin souffle with ginger clove Anglais and fresh berries ($6.50) are also on the menu.


A New Terminal in Frankfurt
The Frankfurt Airport last month opened Terminal 2, a new glass-domed building that will handle 19 international airlines formerly situated in Terminal 1, including Delta, Continental and, starting in January, USAir.
Because Lufthansa (along with its partner, United Airlines) has remained in Terminal 1, passengers must transfer between Terminals 2 and 1 to reach many connecting flights to final destinations in Germany.
Those travelers should be careful to have their luggage checked through to their last stop.
Passengers entering Germany from abroad may clear customs at their final destination rather than at the port of entry.


Selling a Home Without a Broker
To the Editor:
Your "Selling Without A Broker" (Your Home, Nov. 13), which made some useful points about selling a residence without the aid of a real estate broker, was correct as far as it went.
However, it missed an essential point.


Old-Time Toys for an Old Time Holiday
Ever have a Rubik's cube or an old Raggedy Ann doll you just couldn't throw away?
Apparently, so have many other New Yorkers for more than a hundred years.
Hundreds of these old toys have been donated to the Museum of the City of New York and are now displayed in an exhibition called "A New York Holiday."


'Oliver!' in Revival at the Paper Mill
COMMON wisdom has it that revivals are the life blood of the infirm musical theater.
Not quite.
The good old faithful revival is almost as infrequently produced as the musical just out.
Instead of settling for retreads of golden oldies, bold directors have been putting a new spin on shows of another time.
For better or worse, reinventions of "Carousel" (better) and "My Fair Lady" (worse) have invoked the symbolic and the psychological -- fashionably called "dark" -- sides of musicals previously noted for sentiment and charm.


Proof Is in the Polls: Women's Game Has Grown in Appeal and Stature
If two rounds of the preseason Women's National Invitation Tournament have already been played, and if Tennessee and Louisiana Tech, perhaps the two best teams in the land, are meeting today in the State Farm Hall of Fame Tip-Off Classic, and if 20 or 30 teams have been playing every night for a week, why is it the women's college basketball season does not start until Friday night?
Well, preseason tournaments don't count.
And those recent nontournament games that sent collegians against foreign or club teams don't count, either.
Nothing counts until Friday night, collegiate conference races do not heat up until January and a National Collegiate Athletic Association champion will not be crowned until April.


What's New York the Capital of Now?: Refugees; From Russia, With Hope and Fear
FELIX IOSIFOVICH ANDREEV IS HAVING A rough day.
Because he is executive director of the Brighton Beach District Management Association, because he calls himself the unofficial "mayir" of the neighborhood, because he is a natural-born promoter and something of an apparatchik and because he grew up in Moscow, his head teeming with "wild dreams" of America as the land of "liberty and generous people," he wants nothing more than to show off Brighton Beach as a model of American immigrant life.
He is dismayed when it turns out to be just that.
He is still too green a citizen to know that American immigrant life, especially in New York, where it is most lavishly displayed, asserts its character by letting people down as soon as it bucks them up.
This has been particularly true in Brooklyn, which since the 1850's has cooked and stirred a psychedelic soup of Irish, Germans, Italians, Poles, African-Americans, Scandinavians, Puerto Ricans and, more recently, Dominicans, Mexicans, Central Americans, Middle Easterners, Asians and now the people of Felix Andreev.
The earlier arrivals crowded onto Ellis Island; the latest swoop into Kennedy Airport, their dreams submerged by weariness, bewilderment and open-faced excitement.


Yale Rushes Its Way To '94 Bragging Rights
The Ivy League's largest crowd of the season, a turnout of 35,500 that came close to filling Harvard Stadium, today saw a contest that had no special meaning except that it was The Game, the 111th between Harvard and Yale.
Barbecue fragrance wafted all about Soldier Field as the tailgating rites were conducted on a beautiful, warm day out of context from the frigid Harvard-Yale history.


'More Memorable Than the Films'
To the Editor:
Rita Reif's article "Monsters, Demons and Other Delights"  [ Oct. 30 ] , on the exhibition of horror-film memorabilia at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, caught my attention, since one of my father's paintings for the poster for the 1958 film "Monster on the Campus" was prominently displayed.
But, as usual, he was not credited.
I subsequently visited the exhibition; eight of my father's works were there, including poster art for the 1955 "Tarantula" and the 1958 "Attack of the Puppet People." But, again, there was no attribution.


CHARLES MURRAY
The idea that you can explain the distribution of the "goodies" of life in this country by invoking arguments of race and genes is intellectually dishonest ("Daring Research or 'Social Science Pornography'?" by Jason DeParle, Oct. 9).
The public policy implications of "The Bell Curve" are merely Republican prescriptions for laissez-faire policies, with Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein cloaking their arguments in academic garb to gain respectability.
They exalt the virtues of the marketplace and see government policies as assaults on the meritocracy.
They ask us to ignore or forget that this meritocracy systematically excluded women, people of color, the disabled, etc. from the competitive process.
Their argument is not new.
Neither is abuse of so-called scientific research in the service of mean-spirited political objectives.

3 Are Killed and 13 Hurt in Queens


Nov. 13-19; Cranberries. Sweet Potatoes. Ostrich.
ANYONE who says the American economy has lost its vim and vision doesn't know a thing about ostriches.
The lanky birds with Barbara Bush eyes have set off a speculative boom.
Lawyers, realtors, antique dealers: all are plunking down up as much as $40,000 for a pair of the flightless birds, convinced that on a Thanksgiving not too far off, their fellow Americans will be carving ostrich legs.


Troops Enter Rio Slums In Drug War
Joining drug enforcement efforts for the first time, heavily armed Brazilian Army soldiers occupied two densely populated hillside shantytowns here today, setting up sandbag gun positions for a campaign against powerful trafficking gangs.
The soldiers arrived in olive green helicopters and small tanks under a driving tropical rain.
On Friday night, the troops had set up checkpoints at entry points to five other shantytowns in Rio's beachfront area.
Installed without warning, the barriers cut off weekend drug users from their suppliers in this resort city.


CRIME
Of all the killings in DIRTY WHITE BOYS (Random House, $21), the death of the American family is the most monstrous.
That's the story that Stephen Hunter is really telling in his violent and exhilarating crime novel about three convicts who break out of the McAlester pen and cut a murderous swath through Oklahoma and Texas.
Richard Peed, "a weak white man with no criminal skills," is smart.
Odell Pye, who carries a child's brain in his massive body, is dangerous.
Odell's beloved cousin Lamar, "a sly genius at disorder, a prince of chaos," is smart, dangerous and bad.
The bizarre "family" is completed by Ruta Beth Tull, a grim farmer who slips right into the wife-and-mother role, offering the trio refuge and "some terrible parody of happiness" on her remote farm.
A state trooper named Bud Pewtie is the only lawman with a prayer of stopping this oddly pathetic gang of savages, but Pewtie drops his banner as the all-American father-hero when he betrays his wife and children through an adulterous affair.

Westbeth Memories
FOR the parents, Westbeth was the deal of a lifetime: airy apartments in Greenwich Village, very low rent, the company of other artistic people.
When it first opened in 1969 as the nation's biggest federally subsidized arts colony, artists of all kinds clamored for admission.
For the artists' children, the "great peculiar lump of a building" -- as one resident called it -- had other advantages.
It was vast, its long corridors were twisted.
It had dank hidden alcoves and odd back rooms and a roof the size of a city block.
There were lots of other children.


Postal Service Allowed to Sell Flawed Stamp
Six stamp speculators who planned to make hay out of a misprint have had their hopes dashed by a Federal judge, who ruled on Friday that the Postal Service could sell 150,000 copies of a flawed stamp honoring a black rodeo star.
The suit concerned the 1994 "Legends of the Wild West" stamp sheets, which included a stamp featuring the rodeo star, Bill Pickett.
The Postal Service recalled all 5.2 million copies of the sheet in February after relatives said the picture was not "Bulldogging" Bill Pickett, but Ben, the rodeo star's chubby older brother.

Narrators, Unreliable And Otherwise
To the Editor:
Reading Matt Zoller Seitz's essay "Never Trust a Narrator Who's Under 16"  [ Oct. 30 ] , I was amused to see the concept of the unreliable narrator, a staple of academic literary criticism for the last quarter century, applied to a television series.


A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO PRIME TIME
Margaret Cho makes me laugh ("A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to Prime Time," by Martha Southgate, Oct. 30).
I watched the first episode of "All-American Girl" with my entire family and realized that the United States is beginning to recognize that it has a multiethnic population.
But bluntly stated, the show is not as funny as it could be.
And its producers should be asking themselves why.
I'll throw them a hint: There's not a single Korean-American writer on the show.

Southern Africa's Old Front Line Ponders Its Future in Mainstream
As a summit meeting of southern African leaders was winding down last month, Frederick Chiluba, the elfin former union leader who is now the President of Zambia, lapsed into a pensive monologue.
Maybe Africa was not really cut out for Western-style democracy, he told his fellow heads of state with a sigh.
How could a president get anything done with opponents constantly carping at him?
Maybe the one-party state was the way to go, after all.


Abbey Quests
To the Editor: John Russell's informative and insightful article "Westminster's Ancient Abbey" (Oct. 23) brought back wonderful and amusing memories of our last visit there, in May.
We were awed again in this majestic yet intimate building.
As we wandered along with hundreds of others, the mixture of voices, music, echoes and silence was somehow fitting for this ancient yet vital edifice.


Viewpoints; The Credit Card: We Love It, We Hate It
WHAT is the defining act of the American consumer?
Easy.
It is handing a salesperson that slim piece of encoded plastic -- the credit card.
What is harder to answer is why so common an act is such a mystery.
On the one hand, we love the Card.
There are 1.15 billion credit cards in circulation, amounting to nearly 10 for every American cardholder.
This year, collectively, we will charge about $700 billion of goods and $325 billion of debt on them.

The Meat Industry's Bad Beef
The American Meat Institute claims it is only trying to protect consumers from dangerously contaminated beef, but it has chosen an odd way to do so.
The trade association, joined by six other food-industry and supermarket groups, has filed suit to stop the Agriculture Department from testing ground beef for E. coli bacteria that are responsible for as many as 20,000 illnesses and 500 deaths a year.
The contamination occurs when a cow's intestinal or fecal matter comes into contact with muscle meat during unsanitary slaughter.
Ground beef poses a special hazard because the grinding process spreads the contamination throughout the product.
Proper cooking will kill the bacteria, but many people have grown used to eating their beef rare or raw.
Even a supposedly well-done hamburger may not be safe because of uneven temperatures within the patty as it is cooked.


Shari B. Gersten, David M. Rosenblatt
Shari Beth Gersten, a daughter of Roslyn and Gerald Gersten of Scarsdale, N.Y., was married last evening to David Mark Rosenblatt, a son of Roslyn and Harvey Rosenblatt of Pittsburgh.
Rabbi David Lincoln performed the ceremony at the Park Avenue Synagogue in New York.
The bride is a special assistant to the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade at the Commerce Department in Washington.
She graduated cum laude from Brandeis University and received a law degree from American University.
Her father retired as the owner of Lila Food Packers, wholesale grocers in the Bronx.
Her mother owns the R. G. Domestic Employment Agency in Hartsdale, N.Y.


Running as One
To the Sports Editor:
What kind of people live in New York City?
My answer to that question changed on Marathon Sunday 1993.
Living in Brooklyn, I saw and experienced crime, prejudice and the feeling of being alone in the middle of a crowd.
While running in the 1993 New York City Marathon, I got a view of community togetherness.


Heidi M. Stetz, Richard Schwartz
Heidi Marie Stetz, a daughter of Elaine Wood of Plattsburgh, N.Y., and a stepdaughter of David Wood, is to be married today to Richard Fox Schwartz, a son of Penny Schwartz of Fort Lee, N.J., and Stan Schwartz of New York.
Rabbi Haskel J. Lookstein is to officiate at a private residence in Teaneck, N.J.
Ms.
Stetz, 27, is keeping her name.
She is the merchandise coordinator in Manhattan for the women's division of Calvin Klein.
She and the bridegroom graduated from the State University at Albany, he cum laude.
Her mother is a special-education teacher at Saranac (N.Y.) Central High School.
The bride's stepfather is a lawyer in Plattsburgh.


Autumn's Long-Lasting Fruit of the Vine
ALTHOUGH the big time for decorative pumpkin faces has gone by, the season for other distinguished members of the clan has arrived.
Pumpkins belong to a rather special group of plants called the gourd family, which also includes such diverse edibles as cucumbers, watermelons and cantaloupes as well as squash and, of course, decorative gourds.


Inflation Fuels Discontent Against Iran's Government
Iranian demonstrators took time out from a week of state-sponsored anti-American rallies recently to redirect their anger against the Islamic Government and economic policies that have created a crisis of inflation.
At a demonstration this month commemorating the takeover of the United States Embassy during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, nearly 500 students called for the execution of "capitalists" and denounced lawmakers for favoring wealthy merchants over low-income groups.


Late Rally by West Virginia Topples B.C.
West Virginia continued a comeback from a dismal early season, beating Boston College, 21-20, today to improve its record to 6-5 and brighten its bowl hopes.
The sophomore quarterback Chad Johnston zipped a 19-yard touchdown pass to Zach Abraham -- their second touchdown connection -- with 4 minutes 8 seconds remaining in the game and the West Virginia defense held on.


Nov. 13-19; Cadillac Heaven


Root Vegetables to Sop Up the Gravy
FOR many, turkey is one of those things in life you have to accept, like teen-age acne or rap music.
I actually quite like turkey (pumpkin pie is another matter), but I'd rather eat it cold the next day, preferably around 11 in the morning, standing by the refrigerator.
My favorite part of Thanksgiving dinner, apart from chestnut stuffing, is the vegetables that are traditionally served with turkey.
I have always loved creamed white onions, brussels sprouts, sweet potato puree and braised red cabbage.


Correction
An article on Oct. 30 about the Cone sisters, the art collectors for whom the Baltimore Museum of Art's newly refurbished Cone Galleries are named, misstated Claribel Cone's birthplace and profession.
She was born in Jonesboro, Tenn., not in Baltimore, and was a pathologist, not a gynecologist.
The article also misstated the ownership of Picasso's painting "Mother and Child." It did not belong to both sisters; Etta bought it after Claribel's death.
The article also referred incorrectly to the purchase of Matisse's "Blue Nude." That painting was bought by Claribel, not by Etta, and not from Gertrude Stein but at an auction of the estate of the lawyer and arts patron John Quinn.

'Dictatorship of Virtue'
To the Editor:
Only by using an elastic measuring stick and the proverbial rose-colored glasses could one pronounce, say, the civilization of the Australian aborigines to be the "equal" of that of Greece in the fifth century B.C. or put the indigenous cultures of sub-Saharan Africa on a par with those of Renaissance Italy or Elizabethan England.


'Bobby Was a Difficult Child': My Cousin, Robert Lowell
MY first cousin once removed was Robert Lowell, the poet -- a fact I just happened to mention on my application to Harvard University.
The worst part was that I had to work it into the essay section.
They had a section for listing family members who had gone to Harvard, but that was only for immediate family members.
It was 3 o'clock in the morning and the application was due next day.
So I started writing something dumb about my intellectual development -- or was it my personal growth? -- all the time saying to myself, "I can't, I can't," when suddenly out of the blue came, "As I was having dinner last night with my first cousin once removed, Robert Lowell, the poet, I turned to him and said. . . ."
That was a long time ago, in 1969, and it is just as well to make a clean breast of it now.
Also, I might just as well admit that I do not get poetry.
In high school I was good at subjects like "The Culture of Poverty" and "The Negro," but when it came to analyzing those poets, forget it.
To this day, put a gun to my head and I still cannot tell you the difference between the tone of a poem and the mood of a poem.
Still, I did not lie on the application.
Bobby -- Bobby is what we called him in the family -- had been out to Concord the night before. (Concord, Mass., is where I grew up, under the influence of the writings of Louisa May Alcott -- my mother said there was an excruciating period when I called her Marmee and helped with the dishes every two seconds.) Bobby came out to visit my mother whenever he was teaching at Harvard.
They were first cousins, and Bobby had been reading her his poems ever since they were teen-agers summering at Rock.
They got along great, although neither of them probably understood a word the other one said.
My mother is very pretty and very normal, and she believes in treating other people as normal even if they're not.


The Mobster Was a Mole for the F.B.I.; Tangled Life of a Mafia Figure Who Died of AIDS Is Exposed
Inside the Mafia, Gregory Scarpa Sr. could have served as a role model for ambitious gangsters.
His underworld persona was that of a steadfastly loyal capo, or captain, in the Colombo crime family who for three decades ran rackets in New York City that enriched himself and his mob partners.
A flashy dresser who often carried $5,000 in cash, he at one point had homes on Sutton Place, in Las Vegas, and in Brooklyn and on Staten Island.
Guile and ruthlessness earned him the underworld nicknames of "Hannibal" for his tactics and the "grim reaper" for his violence.


Will Rogers Institute Expands Its Mission
WHEN Will Rogers the laconic American actor, social satirist and the biggest star of his day -- was killed in a plane crash in 1935, the entertainment industry set up a charity to honor his memory.
Rogers was known not only for his humor and rope tricks but also for his compassion and kindness to colleagues.
Almost 60 years later, the Will Rogers Institute has managed to maintain its vision of offering medical assistance to those in show business while adapting to entertainment and health fields so changed that Rogers himself would barely recognize them.

Why Proposition 187 Won't Work
Proposition 187, the California ballot initiative that deprives illegal immigrants of state services, has quickly been revealed as the inhumane headache its opponents promised it would be.
Already a host of examples of the new measure's inevitable consequences have shown how unlikely it is that its supporters really thought much before casting their votes.


Politics, Power and Other Phone Games
WHEN it comes to the telephone, the way that a call is returned often speaks louder than any words.
Just ask Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose congratulatory calls to Governor-elect George E. Pataki on election night have gone unreturned for almost two weeks now -- creating a day-by-day vigil that has provided fun for David Letterman and some the city's papers, at least one of which published both men's numbers.
Yet, by the standards of serious telephone jocks, the out-and-out snub implicit in Mr.
Pataki's aloofness is amateur stuff.
There is a whole range of strategies in the gamesmanship of returning calls, and each one conveys a subtle bit of information about the relationship between the caller and the callee.


Grading Game
To the Sports Editor:
Thomas George's article extols Steve McNair's academic success ("McNair, With Record Distance, Seeks Degree," The Times, Oct. 23).
The accompanying graphic of McNair's academic transcript tells a different story.


STEVE GUNDERSON
I found it interesting that good friends and fellow Representatives Newt Gingrich and Steve Gunderson likened Gunderson's homosexuality to alcoholism and left-handedness, respectively, in Chandler Burr's article "Congressman (R), Wisconsin. Fiscal Conservative, Social Moderate, Gay" (Oct. 16).
Gingrich certainly showed me the light when he said, "It's an orientation in the way alcoholism is an orientation." Does he mean that the way it sounds?
An acquired disability or sickness as a way of life?
Gunderson's metaphor surprised me as well.
Comparing your life style to an awkward physical characteristic may be a sign that you're not comfortable with it.
I understand what Gunderson was trying to say, though -- that the world is about as well suited to gays as it is to southpaws.

Opening Lot For Parking To Get a Park
The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation will offer a parking lot concession to a Sheepshead Bay business that is willing to put up money to turn a stretch of abandoned city-owned land at the edge of the bay into a park.
City officials and community groups say that Lundy's Management Corporation, a development concern that is working to turn the old Lundy's restaurant on Emmons Avenue, a mile west of the site, into a retail complex, has offered to spend $700,000 on the park in exchange for the 100-space parking concession, which would be used by shoppers.


Exit Nears For Sex Shops On Times Sq.
Don't blink yet but a third of Times Square's remaining sex-related businesses will soon be evicted by a state agency, making way for a planned major new hotel, retail and entertainment complex at the northeast corner of 42d Street and Eighth Avenue.
Neighborhood civic leaders are worried that the pornography shops will simply pop up at new sites nearby, as in the past.
Such moves would be blocked by an anticipated one-year city moratorium on the opening of sex businesses but, as Nicholas Fish, Community Board 5's chairman, says, people fear the shops "will relocate prior to the moratorium's kicking in."

A Year After Trade, Yanks Giving Up on Hernandez
A year ago, the Yankees made two pitching moves they thought could help catapult them into the division championship they had not experienced since 1981.
They acquired Terry Mulholland from the Philadelphia Phillies to help stabilize their starting rotation, and they obtained Xavier Hernandez from the Houston Astros in the hope that he could be their closing reliever.
They were wrong on both counts, and now neither pitcher remains with them.


Latin American Roads
To the Editor:
A Nov. 12 Business Day article reports glowingly on privatization of public roads in Latin America.
Tolls charged by the new owners cover construction, maintenance and interest costs, and the owners will add premiums to cover toll collection and make a profit.

Intricacies of Redistricting: Draw, and Then Draw Again
From Morris Heights up to Riverdale, School District 10 spans a diverse racial and socioeconomic territory, from its poor southern neighborhoods to its richer northern ones.
A plan to redraw the district -- one of the city's largest in geography and student population -- along north-south lines was scrapped amid an outpouring of criticism that it was tantamount to racial segregation.
But a revised plan to split the district in western and eastern sections, while not eliciting the same level of opposition, has left many doubting it, too, underscoring the intricacies of redistricting in a racially and economically mixed area.

Cantor Kerry Ben-David performed the ceremony, in which Msgr.
James Cooney took part.
Mrs.
Clendenin, 29, is a second vice president in the credit card division of Chase Manhattan Bank in New York.
She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.
Her father is a director of institutional sales at Cowen &amp; Company, a securities brokerage in New York.

Farmland Preservation Is Lagging
A STATE program started 14 years ago to preserve New Jersey's diminishing farmland has so far saved 22,080 acres -- an average of about 1,575 acres a year.
But during the same period, an average of 10,000 acres a year has been sold for development, state records show.
Further, state officials acknowledge that despite efforts in recent years to streamline the application process, insufficient local and state funds, political delays and the state's relatively high land values have contributed to large backlogs in applications for the State Farmland Preservation Program.
As a result, the state approves fewer than a dozen applications a year for farmland preservation while hundreds of others are routinely turned down.


What's New York the Capital of Now?: Scenes; The Village Barber
MY FRIEND M. WORKS 12-hour days at a record company.
To meet her for dinner, I book weeks in advance; lunch is out of the question.
So when she confesses that she has been going to a hair salon "far too often," making appointments for cut and color on separate Saturdays so she can go twice as much (when before she ranked getting her hair done right up there with having root canal), I am intrigued.
There is something about this salon that makes her want to be there.
"I can't explain what it is," she says.
Strolling along West Fourth Street on a balmy Saturday morning, past people in blue jeans sipping cappuccino at sidewalk cafes, teased by the aroma of home fries wafting from an open restaurant door, I come upon M.'s salon at the corner of Bank Street, and recognize it as a place I've seen at night -- its arched Palladian windows softly lighted, a spectacular vase of flowers on a glass table inside -- and wondered, hurrying on to somewhere else, what could it be?
There was no lettering stenciled on the windows, no name proudly emblazoned on an awning.
Peering in, I could see a pair of handsome, framed mirrors, and two beautiful, battered, tall Thonet chairs.
The space was spare yet expectant, like a stage after everyone's gone home.


Many Women Eager to Test Abortion Pill
A month after the announcement that the Planned Parenthood clinics here and in five other cities would take part in the clinical trial of the French abortion drug RU-486, thousands of women have called to volunteer, the clinics say.
"It's been much more than we expected," said Kitty Kahn, director of surgical services for the Houston clinic.
Her clinic has received more than a thousand calls from prospective volunteers from Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, and as far away as Iowa, she said.


Many Fingers, Many Pies
In 1923 an affable high school dropout, Miguel Covarrubias (1904-57), arrived in New York from Mexico City armed with an extraordinary talent for drawing, a keen intellect, boundless curiosity and good connections.
His gifts were immediately recognized by the likes of Carl Van Vechten and Frank Crowninshield, and he soon found work doing caricatures and illustrations for Vanity Fair and other leading magazines.
Gallery shows, book publication and commissions for set designs followed.
Rosa Roland was a celebrated dancer and choreographer when Covarrubias met her, but by the time they married in 1930, she had left the stage.
A striking beauty photographed by, among others, Edward Weston and Cartier-Bresson, she became an accomplished painter, photographer and cook.
In COVARRUBIAS (University of Texas, $29.95), Adriana Williams, an independent scholar, chronicles the lives and times of Miguel and Rosa Covarrubias with a veritable torrent of names, places and events.
Most of the notable artists and intellectuals from the 1920's and 30's seem to have crossed their paths, either in New York, on their travels, or in Mexico City, where they moved in the mid-30's.
Their wide range of friends included Al Hirschfeld, Nelson Rockefeller, Diego Rivera and John Huston.
Covarrubias was fascinated by the ethnic roots of culture and eager to experience authentic forms of dance, music and art before they were lost to the leveling effect of modern life.
This passion not only enriched his art -- from the Harlem drawings to his murals for San Francisco's 1938 international exposition -- but also led to books on Balinese culture and the archeology of Mexico.
Ms.
Williams has not worked this rich material into an authoritative biography, but the abundant information she has gathered should serve future biographers well.

A Capitol Hill Empire Is in Eclipse, Ending a Long Reign by Its Emperor
After 14 years of unchecked expansion, the empire of Representative John David Dingell Jr. is being dismantled.
Like a plump Thanksgiving turkey, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where Mr.

Gleeful Republicans have begun to disassemble its muscular investigative unit and pass around its meaty legislative authority.


Tigers, Elephants and Sharks Gain at Conservation Meeting
The agenda was as diverse as Noah's passenger list and, not surprisingly, conservationists said the results were mixed as partners in a treaty to control global trade in imperiled species concluded a meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., this week.
Ten Asian nations taking part in the biannual meeting of the treaty's signers reached a major accord to protect tigers, whose parts are often used in folk medicine and whose numbers are steadily dwindling despite the treaty's safeguards.

A Heisman Race
To the Sports Editor:
William C. Rhoden wrote that Steve McNair will not win the Heisman Trophy this year in "The Heisman Vote's 3-Card Monte" (The Times, Nov. 13).
He reasons that "ultimately the dynamic here is not racism but Place-ism." History, however, discloses that only racism can deny McNair this award.

SERBIAN JETS BOMB MUSLIMS A 2D DAY, FLOUTING U.N. BAN
Defying NATO and the United Nations Security Council, nationalist Serb fighter jets bombed a Bosnian Muslim enclave for the second straight day today, United Nations officials said.
One jet crashed into an apartment complex crowded with refugees, and at least nine civilians were injured.
One apartment building was struck by bombs in the attack at Cazin, a town in the besieged Bihac pocket of northwestern Bosnia, said Paul Risley, a spokesman for the United Nations military in Zagreb, Croatia.
It was not clear whether the casualties resulted from the bombing or from the crash of the plane or both, he added.
He said the pilot had been killed.


Supreme Court to Rule On Frequent Flier Miles
DO airlines have to keep their promises to the millions of members of their frequent flier plans?
And what if they don't?
While the all-American response may be "see you in court," the answer did not appear nearly so simple in an argument before the United States Supreme Court this month.
In American Airlines v.
Wolens, the Justices have agreed to decide whether airlines can be sued for consumer fraud or breach of contract in connection with retroactive changes in the value of frequent flier miles.


Mavis Lockwood, Jonathan Borak
Mavis Ferens Lockwood, a daughter of Dr.

An officer of the city of Geneva performed the ceremony at the Hotel de Ville in Geneva.
The bride, 41, is a neuromuscular training specialist and a certified movement analyst, and she teaches anatomy and kinesiology at Connecticut College in New London, Conn.
She was the dean of the Laban/Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies in New York, from which she received a graduate certificate.
She graduated from Hampshire College.
Her father, who is retired, was a president of Trinity College in Hartford.


Still Waiting for Library Renovation to Start
When the Tompkins Square Library shut down in May for a major renovation, patrons of the branch eagerly watched for the project to begin.
Six months later, they are still waiting.
"Among the playground moms, it's one of our big topics," said Lin Wefel, who regularly used the library with her 8-year-old daughter, Ariel.
"When it dawned on us that they weren't doing anything, that started everybody gabbing and wondering. There were even rumors that they may close it completely."


AIDS Instruction Has to Be Explicit
With words like "shocking" and statements such as, "The more I found out the more astonished and embarrassed for my clients I was by how pandering the curriculum is," he was reacting to material that is necessarily explicit in order to make as clear as possible the ways in which the deadly virus that causes AIDS is transmitted.
With the epidemic as horrid as it is, not just in the world, but right here on Long Island, and increasingly among our youth, as well as adult men and women, the need for plain talk should be understood rather than disparaged.


KILL FOR LIFE
So far, Roy McMillan has been content to let others do his bidding, defending anti-abortion murderers but claiming that he would never point the gun.
Now that your magazine has made of him an overnight celebrity, might he not feel that he has to act on his beliefs?
Remember that Paul Hill, convicted murderer of Dr.
John Bayard Britton and James Barrett in Pensacola, Fla., spouted his hateful rhetoric on "Donahue" and "Nightline" only months before practicing what what he preached.
In a society that rewards with publicity those who espouse coldblooded murder, the consequences can be tragic.

After Five Years, Carroll's Road Winds Back to Minnesota
They coach big-league teams a block apart on Long Island, where they live around the corner from each other, and they both left Minnesota to follow their dreams in New York.
Even more, Lorne Henning understands how Pete Carroll feels about returning Sunday to play the Vikings at the Metrodome as head coach of the Jets.
Carroll spent five years as Minnesota's secondary coach and Sunday's game will be the first time he has faced his old team since departing after the 1989 season to join the Jets as their defensive coordinator.


Nov. 13-19; Wow, Talk About Landslides!
How close was it?
Think of it this way: In a Congressional District of 54 towns spread across eastern Connecticut, where 186,000 people went to the polls on Nov. 8, Sam Gejdenson squeaked into his eighth term in Congress with a victory margin the size of a typical car pool.
Or a bridge game.
Or the members of his immediate family.
He won by four votes, two one-thousands of 1 percent, according to the recount completed last week.
Only one Congressional race in the 20th century has been closer.
That took place in 1910 in New York, when Charles Bennett Smith defeated De Alva Stanwood Alexander by a single vote.


Santa Fe Art Market Scheduled for December
The winter version of Santa Fe's Spanish Market, a colorful exhibition of contemporary artwork in the Spanish Colonial tradition, will be held this year on Dec. 3 and 4 in La Fonda Hotel.
More than 125 artists from New Mexico and southern Colorado are expected to take part.
The summer edition of the festival is usually overshadowed by the town's far larger and better-known Indian Market, but the work on display in the winter also reflects an enduring cultural presence.
Consisting primarily of folk and religious pieces, the Spanish art testifies to the 500-year history of the Spanish in New Mexico, and the close ties between church, family and community.


Commercial Property/The Lower Manhattan B.I.D.'s Chief; A Politically Savvy Leader Jumps In Swinging

Sam Shepard Goes to the Races and Wins
IN THE FIRST ACT OF SAM Shepard's fine, seriously funny new play, "Simpatico," two old friends meet for the first time in years in a cheap apartment in Cucamonga, Calif.
The place is so small and barren that it makes the average hot-bed motel room look like a suite at the Ritz.
Vinnie (Fred Ward) lies on the filthy, cotlike bed, apparently in the last stages of physical and mental dissolution.
He's unshaven, his hair matted.
The expensively dressed, immaculately groomed Carter (Ed Harris) walks around a heap of dirty laundry with care, as if he didn't want to soil the soles of his shoes.
They talk edgily about the old days before they went their separate ways, Vinnie into hiding under a succession of assumed names in backwater towns, Carter to fortune, power and respectability raising thoroughbred race horses in Lexington, Ky.
The slobbish Vinnie baits Carter as much with what his ex-wife describes as the "apologetic menace" in his voice as by what he says.
To tell the truth, Vinnie sneers, he always thought that Carter would run for Congress: "You had that aura about you. A kind of a, uh -- yuppie Protestant aura that's become so popular these days."

Time and Again: Watch Fobs Are a Fad
The watch fob, a 19th-century signature on every gentleman's vest, is being revived -- often without the watch -- by both men and women as a form of decorating the tailored pants suit.
One style is to wear a fob anchored in the lapel buttonhole with the chain cascading into the breast pocket.
A man seen on Madison Avenue (bottom, far right) wore both the traditional vest fob and a jacket lapel chain.
The same chains are being worn by women as bracelets wrapped twice around the wrist (bottom, second from right).

A Steakhouse That Matches Its Looks
WHEN Dar Tiffany was reviewed four years ago the striking restaurant in Greenvale resembled a Miss America contestant.
It was an obvious winner in the swimsuit competition but fell short on talent.
At a steakhouse talent means terrific meat.
At that time the restaurant did not measure up.
But things have changed.
This year Dar Tiffany was sold, resulting in a shakeup in the kitchen.
Now the food is a match for its good looks.


Journal; Blowing In the Wind
Of all the comebacks of Election '94, surely the strangest is the counterculture.
Declared dead in the 1970's and finally laid to permanent rest at Woodstock II last summer, the counterculture was long ago annexed by a corporate culture that employs the Beatles' "Revolution" to hawk Nikes.
But now Newt Gingrich, echoing other Republican moralists like William Bennett and Dan Quayle, has brought the counterculture back -- not for a reunion concert, alas, but as a scapegoat with flowers in its hair.
Not only is the counterculture being held responsible for the excesses of Bill Clinton -- a non-inhaling Fleetwood Mac fan, of all unlikely hippies -- but for everything immoral, violent and sexually explicit in American culture today.


Celebrating the Roar Of Literary Lions
Writers are honored at the New York Public Library's annual dinner, Nov. 14.


In Demand
To the Sports Editor:
When Ken Griffey Jr. needed one home run to tie the major league record for home runs hit in successive games, I happened to be in Seattle and I wanted to go to the game.
I grabbed the opportunity to purchase four seats near the home dugout at the list price of $25 per seat.


Driver Killed and 15 Hurt As Van Crashes in Queens
A van packed with 16 people spun out of control on the Grand Central Parkway in Queens yesterday morning, skidding 200 feet before it flipped over onto the metal-rail divider, crushing the roof and those inside, the police said.
The driver was killed immediately, and the injured were taken to six hospitals, where two later died.
Some of the survivors remained in critical condition, though all were expected to live.
Four people were released.


Ms. Belasky, Mr. Greenberg
Alisa Joy Belasky, the daughter of Sharyn and Michael Belasky of Oyster Bay Cove, L.I., is to be married today to Sanford Harris Greenberg, a son of Millicent and William Greenberg of New York.
Rabbi Brooks R. Sussman is to officiate at Temple Israel in Lawrence, L.I.
The bride, 26, is a lawyer in the compliance department at Smith Barney, the New York securities brokerage.
She graduated from Emory University and received her law degree from Hofstra University.


Teaching Mothers Their Job
A GROUP of eight pre-schoolers were clustered on a rug in a cheerful, brightly lighted space while their teacher used finger puppets to engage them in a nursery sing-along song.
The paraphernalia of a day-care setting, from alphabet decorations, Little Tikes plastic riding toys and wooden play kitchens to a quiet room with cribs for babies were present.
But for all the similarities to a conventional day-care program, the youngsters at the Cottage Place housing project are part of a social experiment designed to help their mothers become better parents.
A Different Start, founded here in 1990 by Irene Groban, a social worker, and Joyce Smith, a teacher, offers mothers who might neglect or abuse their children a structured setting to learn both child-rearing strategies and academic skills while their children are cared for.


In Hartford, Bumptious and Alive and on the Cutting Edge
NEGATIVE ENERGY," a show that contains no words but manages to seem loquacious nonetheless, is on view at Real Art Ways in Hartford. And as habitues of this alternative space have come to expect, the effect is relentlessly avant-garde and not a little confusing.
Take, for example, the title: This may or may not be a pun on electricity and the photographic process.
But it hardly matters for, to quote the news release, the show it defines "stretches the rules and possibilities of photography" (as if they needed any more stretching).
This is not to say the display lacks visual interest; on the contrary, with most of the images in black and white, it is one of the gallery's more dramatic looking (and more disciplined) installations.


This Country Needs A Guest Worker Plan
To the Editor:
Amid the distortions and emotional statements about the mass migrations of the world's rural peoples to urban areas, it was heartening to read a few sensible words from President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico (news article, Nov. 14).
Mr.
Salinas stated that the movement of millions of Mexicans "is inevitable, and it is better to order and regulate it than to confront it with administrative measures that are not going to stop it."


Root Vegetables to Sop Up the Gravy
FOR many, turkey is one of those things in life you have to accept, like teen-age acne or rap music.
I actually quite like turkey (pumpkin pie is another matter), but I'd rather eat it cold the next day, preferably around 11 in the morning, standing by the refrigerator.
My favorite part of Thanksgiving dinner, apart from chestnut stuffing, is the vegetables that are traditionally served with turkey.
I have always loved creamed white onions, brussels sprouts, sweet potato puree and braised red cabbage.


Autumn's Long-Lasting Fruit of the Vine
ALTHOUGH the big time for decorative pumpkin faces has gone by, the season for other distinguished members of the clan has arrived.
Pumpkins belong to a rather special group of plants called the gourd family, which also includes such diverse edibles as cucumbers, watermelons and cantaloupes as well as squash and, of course, decorative gourds.


Medicinal Rather Than Melodic?
To the Editor:
As a composer, I read Edward Rothstein's essay "Supply-Side Composers Join the Band"  [ Oct. 30 ]  with interest.
I am writing in response to the larger questions raised: Why does our society find most of today's serious concert music superfluous?
Why would most audiences prefer to do without that which we composers feel such an imperative to write?


Alabama Gets the Measure of Archrival
The chains were brought onto the field and stretched out as far as the first-down sticks would reach while the state of Alabama waited and watched.
Thirty-one seconds remained in the yearlong passion play of Alabama and Auburn, a bitter co-existence that can divide households right down the middle of their dining-room tables.
Despite an early 21-point Alabama lead, the game had somehow stayed close to Auburn's audacious grasp, even now, as it came to a temporary, breathless halt.


All Aboard: Big East Is Switching From the Local to the Express
Three new coaches, each of whom loves to run on offense and press on defense.
Two marquee freshman guards, both of whom may force their new coaches to run whether they like it or not.
Syracuse and Connecticut, both favorites again this season, both with tradition steeped in wide-open basketball.
Don't look now, but the Big East has finally caught up with the 1990's.


Changing Visions of Madness in America
IN 1751, CIVIC LEADERS OF Philadelphia asked authorities to charter the colonies' first mental hospital.
The main concern, wrote Benjamin Franklin, was the growing number of "lunatics" who "going at large are a terror to their neighbors, who are daily apprehensive of the violences they may commit."
Have things come full circle?
A sense of historical cycles comes through repeatedly in the new exhibition "Madness in America: Cultural and Medical Perceptions of Mental Illness Before 1914." An exploration of how changing ideas resonated among science, culture and art, the 60-odd items in this compact show, gathered from far-flung sources, are on view at the New York Academy of Sciences and the New York Academy of Medicine, until Dec. 30.


Sports of The Times; For Ramsey, Home Is Where His Heart Is
AUBURN fans may find this difficult to believe, but Eric Ramsey has never stopped cheering for their Tigers.
His heart broke when Auburn was tied by Georgia last week and Ramsey was so excited about the Auburn-Alabama game yesterday that he planned to fly into Birmingham -- in dark glasses and trench coat -- to attend.
His lawyer advised against it.
Told Ramsey that he didn't want him to get carried away.
Literally.


In Mississippi, Bondholders Cry Fraud
BELLE CASINOS promised "Old South charm and elegance." The bondholders who lent it money encountered what they now charge in court was fraud and duplicate sets of books.
And they face one of the most audacious claims by a bond issuer ever.
Having sold what it labeled first mortgage bonds, Belle now says that there was no mortgage at all.
So the bondholders, it argues, have no claim to the casino built with their money.
The Belle saga, the first bankruptcy in the burgeoning Mississippi casino industry but surely not the last, is a tale of many things, including Wall Street faddishness and foolishness, inept marketing and ruinous competition.
It also serves as a warning to those who have complacently asserted that today's junk bond market, unlike that of the late 1980's, has not grown overly speculative.


Corrections
A table last Sunday showing voter preferences in the elections for the House of Representatives included incorrect racial breakdown figures for voters nationwide.
Revised data from Mitofsky International, the company that conducted the Election Day poll, show that the electorate was 84 percent white, 10 percent black, 4 percent Hispanic and 1 percent Asian (not 79, 13, 5 and 1).

Helping Groups Find Out About Lending Practices
To the Editor:
As former staff attorney at the Bronx-based community organization, Inner City Press/Community on the Move -- discussed in "Taking on the Banks, Crusading for the Bronx," Nov. 13 -- I was deeply involved in preparing three challenges recently submitted to the Federal banking regulators under the Community Reinvestment Act against First Fidelity, NatWest and Republic banks.


Pregnant Woman Is Struck and Killed On Street in Bronx
A pregnant 26-year-old Bronx woman died early yesterday after being struck by a pickup truck and a car while crossing Tremont Avenue, the police said.
The fetus did not survive.
The driver of the pickup was arrested on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol.


Karen L. Conant, Steven E. Rindner
Karen Louise Conant, an associate at Maloney &amp; Burch, a Washington law firm, was married last evening to Steven Eric Rindner, an associate in the Washington office of Shearman &amp; Sterling, the New York law firm.
Rabbi Joseph P. Weinberg officiated at the Willard Hotel.
Mrs.
Rindner, 27, graduated from Cornell University and received her law degree from Georgetown University.
She is a daughter of Ruth and Dr.
Richard H. Conant of Potomac, Md.
Her father is an orthopedic surgeon in Chevy Chase, Md.
Her mother is an interior designer in Potomac.


Finally, That's All He Wrote
For some Glendale residents, the fate of Robert Morrissey eclipses the O. J. Simpson trial.
They went to every one of his eight or nine court proceedings until Mr.
Morrissey pleaded guilty a few weeks ago, and they fully expect to throng the courtroom when he is sentenced on Dec. 14 to one to three years in prison.
Mr.
Morrissey, a 19-year-old resident of East New York, Brooklyn, is one of the most destructive graffiti vandals in the city, according to the Queens District Attorney's office.
Although he was charged with only two specific incidents, law-enforcement officials believe that "DESA" -- the tag, or graffiti signature, they say he spray-painted on walls, bridges, overpasses and posts across Queens and Brooklyn -- has caused more than a $1 million in damage.


A Male Sex Fantasy?
To the Editor:
The responses to my review of Robert Wright's "Moral Animal" (Letters, Oct. 30) demonstrate the value of his book -- careful research and fresh ideas instead of politicized cliches.


Nov. 13-19: Free Speech Issue (Cont.); Justices Overturn Ruling Against a Fiery Educator
The Supreme Court has almost certainly not seen the last of Dr.
Leonard Jeffries, the flamboyantly outspoken chairman of City College's black studies department, though the Justices did find a convenient way last week to get his free speech dispute with the college off their docket and back to the lower courts.
The Court vacated a six-month-old ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, that City College had violated Dr.
Jeffries's First Amendment rights by removing him as department chairman.


Nov. 13-19; Call Me 'Mister,' Aristide Says
The Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide's many enemies within Haiti's Roman Catholic Church have long sought to drive him from the clergy, but the President-priest last week beat them to the punch.
Weary of disputes with his superiors over matters both political and theological and fearful of the impact that could have on Haiti's effort to recover from three years of brutal military rule, he agreed to renounce the priesthood and govern as a layman for the 15 months remaining in his term of office.


Don't Give Short Shrift To a Legendary Nightspot
To the Editor:
The Nov. 13 article, "Fillmore's Next Act: The Wrecking Ball," about the planned demolition of the Fillmore East building at 105 Second Avenue made scant reference to the building's incarnation as a gay disco, The Saint.
Not only did The Saint have a much longer run than Fillmore East (seven years versus three), it arguably played a more important role in the city's history.


Leaping Hurdles, Hospital Reaches Halfway Mark
HALFWAY through New York Hospital's development and modernization program, many of the professionals associated with it are already looking back in satisfaction.
The governmental approval process is complete.
The design work is finished.
The construction contract has been signed.
The platform over the F.D.R.
Drive that serves as the foundation for a large part of the building is in place.
A Federal commitment to insure the mortgage has been granted.


How the Union Joined the South
"HERE'S to the land you tore out the heart of," went the song by the folk singer Phil Ochs during the bloody battles over integration in the South.
"Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of."
Three decades later, as the Republican Party Chairman, Haley Barbour of Mississippi, does his endless, homespun spin over his party's historic election sweep and conservative legislative agenda, it can be argued that Mississippi and the South have taken another route.
Instead of finding another country, they have taken over this one.


Patrick L. Hynes and Brenda Murphy
Brenda Jeanne Murphy, a daughter of Joan Murphy of Breezy Point, Queens, and the late John J. Murphy, was married yesterday to Patrick Liam Hynes, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn.
Msgr.
Michael Connolly performed the ceremony at St.
Edmund Roman Catholic Church in Rockaway Point, Queens.
Mrs.
Hynes, 24, and her husband, 27, graduated from Iona College.
The bride, who teaches history at Canarsie High School in Brooklyn, is studying for a master's degree in guidance counseling at Brooklyn College.


Zelda's Unwavering Love Is No Longer Unrequited
Unrequited love was all that Zelda Gilroy knew as she pined hopelessly more than 30 years ago for an indifferent Dobie Gillis.
As it turned out, she did just fine without him.


MANHATTAN MINUTE
TO THE STREETS: About 50 parents demonstrated in front of Public School 261 in Boerum Hill last week, decrying the $190 million in budget cuts proposed for public schools.
The principal, Arthur Foresta, said that if passed, the cuts would force the school to send elementary students home an hour early and return to half-day kindergartens. . . .
GOOD SPORTS: Public hearings have begun on a proposed sports complex for the underused Steeplechase Park in Coney Island.
If the Sportsplex becomes reality, it will offer a track and field arena, basketball courts and a boxing gym, among other uses.
A chairman of the center's planning commission proposes that the $70 million cost be paid with 30-year tax-exempt bonds. . . .
I.D., PLEASE: In a continuing effort to rid Bay Ridge parks and streets of drunken teen-agers, the 68th Precinct has begun to crack down on stores that sell alcohol to minors.
Last week, seven shop owners were issued summonses for selling to an undercover 20-year-old officer. . . .
ODD REINDEER: The Brooklyn chapter of the Harley Owners Group will hold a ride-a-thon today, zooming from the Canarsie Pier to the St.
Margaret Mary's Head Start Program, a unit of the Brooklyn Catholic Charities, in Long Island City, where the cyclists will arrive bearing gifts for needy children, who will in turn give them milk and cookies.
The ride begins at 11 A.M. at the group's club at 3449 Fort Hamilton Parkway.
The bikers are scheduled to arrive in Long Island City around 1 P.M.


Help Is Available For Alcoholics
I was happy to see you address the issue of alcohol abuse among Long Island's Hispanic population  [ "Isolated Immigrants Aim of D.W.I. Drive," Oct. 2 ] .
The Long Island Center Inc., with offices in Huntington and Massapequa, has been treating problem drinkers and their families for the last 16 years.
We have a special Spanish program, under the direction of a certified social worker, Abe Valentin, that meets every Saturday, and we are always looking for ways to let the community know more about our services.
We are certified by the State Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services.
Anyone who requires further information can reach us at 423-7660.

Anthony Davis and Cynthia Aaronson
Cynthia Aaronson, a soprano who is a former member of the New York City Opera, is to be married today at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in New York to Anthony Davis, a composer, who wrote the music for "Angels in America: Perestroika" on Broadway.
The Buddhist ceremony is to be performed by Joseph Jarman, a priest of the Jodo Shinshu Buddhist Church.
Also to take part in the ceremony are the writer and librettist Thulani Davis-Jarman, Mr.
Jarman's wife, who is also a Buddhist priest and a cousin of the bridegroom.


Paige J. South and Thomas C. Law
Paige Janine South, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
James D. South 2d of Middletown, Pa., and Beach Haven, N.J., was married yesterday to Thomas Craig Law, a son of Doris Law of Carlisle, Pa., and William J. Law of Owensboro, Ky.
The Rev.
Dr.
Eldrich C. Campbell officiated at Kynett United Methodist Church in Beach Haven.
Mrs.

Look-Alike Hostesses And 11 Floors of Food
UPTOWN -- On Nov. 15, Twins, a restaurant on the Upper East Side owned by identical twins and staffed by 23 pairs of identical twins, who filled out the same application forms for their jobs and aren't allowed to work if their twin is sick, had its grand opening.
It was a fun-fun party-party.


Are Extra Pounds An Illusion or Real?
REPORTS of models gaining weight may be somewhat exaggerated.
The New York Post, The Daily News and USA Today are among the publications to report that Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington and Kate Moss are looking heavier.
"As far as I know, Linda hasn't put on weight, nor has Christy," said Katie Ford, co-president of the Ford modeling agency.
Ford represents Ms.
Turlington, but not Ms.
Evangelista.


Picked for Basement, Oregon Gets the Roses
Oregon 17, Oregon State 13
Danny O'Neil, the quarterback who couldn't bring his team from behind, who was booed and second-guessed by Oregon fans for much of his career, has the Ducks in the Rose Bowl for the first time in 37 years.


And Now, Here's . . . Ummm . . . Space Ghost
IMPLAUSIBLE SCENARIO A: ON A faraway barren planet, a sort of Fortress of Bad Attitude, a retired Saturday morning cartoon superhero plots his comeback.
Noting that Earth's late-night airwaves are clogged with talk shows, he launches his own gabfest, inviting guests like Adam West, Weird Al Yankovic and Dr.
Joyce Brothers.
Implausible scenario B: At the Cartoon Network, one of the farthest outposts of the Turner Broadcasting empire, a bevy of frustrated young programming executives confront the sad fact that the cable channel they work for has almost no budget for original programming.
Unearthing a half-forgotten kiddie show from the corporate vaults, they cannibalize it to create their own animated program -- one that is most untypical.

Drug Makers and Black Groups Fight Prescription Controls
At first glance the conference titled "TennCare: An African-American Perspective" hardly seemed unusual.
The daylong meeting in Nashville featured prominent blacks like Louis Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Bush Administration, and the Rev.
Calvin O. Butts of New York's Abyssinian Baptist Church, criticizing Tennessee's revamped Medicaid program and discussing how recent cost-cutting measures could shortchange the poor.
But while the conference was sponsored by a conservative public policy institution and a black physicians' organization, the $67,000 it cost to stage it -- including payment of speaking fees to Mr.
Sullivan -- was provided by a company with a financial interest in blocking some of Tennessee's health-care changes: Pfizer Inc.


What's New York the Capital of Now?: Colonialism; Passing the Plate
THE HISTORY OF EAT- ing in New York, like the history of the city itself, is a story of successive co-optation.
Immigrant groups arrive with exotic eating habits, and within a generation they change the way New Yorkers eat, as surely as they themselves are changed.
German sausages become New York Hot Dogs; Eastern European bread, New York Deli Rye.
Thin-crusted pizza from Naples is reinvented as New York-Style Pizza.
Even food within our own borders is fair game.
What is New York Steak if not the best cut of beef from Chicago's cattle yards?


KILL FOR LIFE
Behind McMillan's talk about loving children, born and unborn, and how he himself could have been aborted, we find a thinly veiled agenda that relegates women to positions of economic, political and social dependence.

Illustrated by Louise August.
Simon &amp; Schuster. $15. (Ages 5 to 9) Why potatoes?

Is Josh Redman a New Archetype
WHETHER HE LIKES IT or not, the saxophonist Josh Redman, at 25, is a walking treatise on the state of jazz.
The three albums that he has released since March 1993 have sold nearly 250,000 copies, many times the number most jazz musicians sell in a lifetime.
He tours as the leader of his own band, playing more than 250 dates a year, which at his age makes him an anomaly.
And for somebody who clearly hasn't finished the maturation process that jazz requires, he has received an extraordinary amount of coverage in the mainstream news media.
Mr.
Redman will appear on Dec. 2 at Town Hall.
It is his biggest New York date so far and a show that moves him out of the clubs into the concert hall.
He is in the process of creating a public personality that's more the province of pop stars than of jazz musicians.
As jazz inches its way into the mainstream, through everything from television commercials to increased spending by major record companies, players who might never have had an audience outside jazz are finding themselves pop icons.


Gambling Crackdown Intercepts a Cash Flow to Organized Crime
Law-enforcement officials in Brooklyn have stepped up investigations in the southern end of the borough in search of illegal gambling operations.
Their efforts are part of a drive to cut off one source of cash flowing to organized crime, officials said.
The latest crackdown is a result of a joint operation between the Kings County District Attorney's office and the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor.
On Oct. 31, 22 people were arrested and $200,000 in betting slips was seized during a two-hour raid of nine sites citywide, three of them in Bensonhurst, at 479-481 74th Street, 425 101st Street and 687 86th Street.


Public Needs, Private Answers -- A special report; Business Districts Grow, At Price of Accountability
More than a decade after New York City business and property owners began creating self-taxing districts to clean, patrol and upgrade their neighborhoods, the districts have spread to virtually every corner of the city, delivering services that once were the sole responsibility of city government.
And though their efforts have generally won broad praise, critics say that some have grown too powerful and have taken over municipal duties without sufficient oversight or public accountability.

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
GHOSTS  HAUNTED AMERICA  By Beth Scott and Michael Norman. Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95.


World Markets; Weighing Murdoch's British TV Venture
DURING the last decade, Rupert Murdoch has shifted his emphasis from the newspaper business to television and entertainment.
In the United States he is best known as the owner of Twentieth Century Fox and the Fox television network.
But he has also built or bought television properties in Europe, Asia and Latin America, arguably giving him greater global reach and influence than any other executive in the electronic media industry.
Now investors have their first chance to place a direct bet on one of Mr.
Murdoch's largest television ventures, British Sky Broadcasting, a satellite-delivered television service that is the main alternative to Britain's four broadcast networks.


To Be Conscious Is to Suffer
THE MASTER OF PETERSBURG By J. M. Coetzee. 250 pp. New York: Viking. $21.95.


The Nets Win Acclaim In Losing to the Magic
The signs were in plain view.
Back-to-back games.
The 2:30 A.M. arrival time via team charter the night before.
And that lackluster victory against the Washington Bullets at home on Thursday.
Putting a fairly predictable spin on what might happen to the Nets against the Orlando Magic on Friday night required little prescience:


Pinning Down a Shining Pair
THE ART OF CLASSICAL BALLET HAS NEVER witnessed anything quite like the partnership of Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev, who began to dance together in the 1960's.
Keith Money, a young photographer, writer and painter, was there from their first rehearsals on.
"Fonteyn and Nureyev: The Great Years," his collection of more than 300 photographs being published this month by HarperCollins, is a record of the dancers' relationship with each other and with Mr.
Money's patient and sensitive camera.
Mr.
Money was warned not to photograph the ballerina.
"She loathed and detested being photographed," he said recently.
Slyly, Mr.
Money piqued her curiosity with a dramatic photograph of two other Royal Ballet stars.
"She gave in when she saw a photo of Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable that I had artfully allowed her to discover half out of my bag."


Getting Through the Maze Of Mortgage Insurance
LIKE many first-time home buyers, Sandy Murphy undertook a crash course on the mortgage market before closing the deal.
In books, newspaper articles and meetings with his mortgage broker, he learned about loan-to-value ratios and lifetime caps.
He also scrutinized amortization tables and pondered the pros and cons of adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans.
"It's a little overwhelming," said Mr. Murphy, a civil engineer from Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.


Levine Leads St. John's Over Wagner in City Showdown
St. John's 34, Wagner 14
Quarterback Mark Levine led St.
John's to its first post-season victory as the Red Storm defeated Wagner, 34-14, in the Eastern College Athletic Conference Division I-AA Bowl yesterday at St.
John's Stadium.


Red Storm Routs Russians
Before the game was even 10 minutes old, St.
John's owned a 22-point lead against a rugged bunch of Russians last night.
Aquarius Select Volvograd of Russia looked bewildered, while St.
John's looked slick as its supposed preseason test quickly evolved into a farce.
St.
John's played intense defense, unveiled a nifty transition game and looked comfortable in new, gaudy, black, red, white and yellow uniforms during a 100-85 victory at Alumni Hall.
Coach Brian Mahoney learned that his team can play strong defense behind both Felipe Lopez and Maurice Brown, can display some nice inside moves with both Charles Minlend and Zendon Hamilton and can thrill the fans with the animated Lopez creating most of the excitement.
Aquarius Coach Sergei Prigunkov found out that his players, despite the deficit and the difference in talent, would not quit as they outscored the Red Storm over the last 30 minutes.


Abbey Quests
To the Editor: What a pleasure to be escorted through Westminster Abbey in company with the distinctive curiosity of John Russell, and his perspective of a half-century.
The records in stone of the Abbey surely rival the printed page or the random guidebook in their near-infinite inventory of potential discoveries.
Daniel Webster, that mountain of sentiment and pragmatism, was the perfect American representative (even though he was a Senator) to burst into tears upon entering the Abbey.


Root Vegetables to Sop Up the Gravy
FOR many, turkey is one of those things in life you have to accept, like teen-age acne or rap music.
I actually quite like turkey (pumpkin pie is another matter), but I'd rather eat it cold the next day, preferably around 11 in the morning, standing by the refrigerator.
My favorite part of Thanksgiving dinner, apart from chestnut stuffing, is the vegetables that are traditionally served with turkey.
I have always loved creamed white onions, brussels sprouts, sweet potato puree and braised red cabbage.


Profile; A Truly Prophetic Bit of Wall Street Swear-and-Tell
THE scene is a small, overheated SoHo theater.
The stage: a square of shiny red floor, with the audience all around.
The props: a few chairs, desks and phones, and scattered papers.
Looming overhead are computer screens flashing the incessant numbers of a Wall Street trading floor.
And the tale the actors are telling is this: A hotshot bond trader has been strutting and crowing about a $460 million profit, but this house-of-straw falsehood is collapsing before our eyes to reveal a very different reality -- a $150 million loss.


Stacey M. Green, Abraham Mintz
Stacey Meryl Green, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Sanford N. Green of Stamford, Conn., is to be married there today to Dr.
Abraham Mintz, a son of Raquel Mintz of Mexico City and the late Dr.
Gregorio Mintz.
Rabbi Ely J. Rosenzveig is to perform the ceremony at Congregation Agudath Sholom.
The bride, 31, is the corporate counsel at the Pitney Bowes Credit Corporation in Norwalk, Conn.
She graduated from New York University, from which she also received her law degree.
Her father retired as an electrical engineer in Stamford.
Her mother, Gloria B. Green, retired as a kindergarten teacher at Public School 299 in Brooklyn.


Nov. 13-19: A Nuclear-Free Ukraine; Moves in the Ukraine Bring Elation to U.S.
What a difference four months makes.
When Leonid Kuchma, former director of a missile factory, was elected Ukraine's President in July, the Clinton Administration feared that he would be another neo-Communist hack who would do little about the problems Washington was worrying about: Ukraine's 1,800 nuclear warheads and its collapsing economy.
But when Mr.
Kuchma visits Washington on Tuesday, he will have done virtually everything President Clinton has asked.
Last Wednesday, thanks to vigorous arm-twisting by Mr.
Kuchma, the Parliament in Kiev voted to eliminate Ukraine's nuclear arms, putting aside the belief that such weapons could make Ukraine a power to reckon with.
The Clinton Administration hailed the vote because it removed roadblocks from two major strategic arms-reductions treaties that had been stalled.


Karen P. Murphy, T. F. Roberts 4th
Karen Patricia Murphy, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
John B. Murphy Jr. of Montville, N.J., was married yesterday at St.
Mary's Church in Pompton Lakes, N.J., to Thomas F. Roberts 4th, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Roberts 3d of West Bay Shore, L.I.
Steven Madreperla, a deacon of the Roman Catholic Church, performed the ceremony, in which the Rev.
Stephen Verkouw, a Lutheran minister, took part.
Mrs.
Roberts, 30, graduated from Lynchburg College.
She is a secretary in the corporate finance department of Dillon Read &amp; Company, the investment bank in New York.
Her father is a partner in the R.B.A.
Group, an engineering and architectural firm in Morristown, N.J.


We're About More Than Just Health Care
To the Editor:
Your article about John Forbes Nash Jr. ("The Lost Years of a Nobel Laureate," Nov. 13) mentioned that Mr.
Nash had visited his former teacher, Albert W. Tucker, at Meadow Lakes, a "nursing home" near Princeton, N.J.
While Mr.
Tucker does indeed reside in the Meadow Lakes Health Care Center, I would like to point out that the words "nursing home" do not offer a complete characterization of our community.
Meadow Lakes, a not-for-profit, nonsectarian complex that is affiliated with the Presbyterian Homes of New Jersey, is much more than a nursing home; it is a continuing-care retirement community, which means that it offers a continuum of care, including independent-living residences, personal care services and on-site health care -- including the 90-bed health care center.
A.
JAMES DUFFY  Hightstown, N.J., Nov. 14  The writer is executive director of Meadow Lakes.


Wall Street; Bank Stocks Make Their Mark, but on the Low End
BANK stocks took big hits last week, monopolizing the lists of 52-week lows in the stock market.
The Federal Reserve's interest rate hike on Tuesday was no help, of course, adding fuel to existing fears that profit margins at banks would grow thinner.
"We're at the point where banks will have to take their deposit rates up, which they haven't done aggressively for a while," said Anthony Lombardi, bank analyst at Dean Witter.
That means skimpier profits as banks compete for the funds they need to make available to borrowers.


Corrections
An article on page 45 of the Arts and Leisure section today about the video documentary "The Art of Conducting" identifies the program's producer, Stephen Wright, incorrectly.
He is the managing director of IMG Artists Europe, not IMG overall.


Let's Recognize the Alarming Disappearance of Unskilled Jobs; G.O.P. and Redistricting
To the Editor:
Re your Nov. 13 news article on racial redistricting's impact on the election: Any notion that the Republican Party supports minority voting rights, as its former chief counsel suggests, borders on hypocrisy.


Wall Street; Betting on Holiday Spenders
NOT all the stepped-up buying this week will be in the nation's department stores.
Some brave souls are venturing out of the local mall and into the neighborhood brokerage office, hoping to cash in on gains in department store stocks this holiday season.
It's anything but a fashionable view, though, that profit opportunities await in the months ahead.
In fact, it would take an obstinate contrarian -- the sort of investor who wore safari suits three seasons into the Armani look -- to bet on a resounding surprise at the stores this season.


Cab Calloway Dies
The flamboyant band leader, who scatted his way to fame in the 1930's as the "Hi-de-ho" man of jazz, was 86.

Friendly, All Right, but Stick to the Pizza
IF ever a place was well-named, it is Amici's Restaurant on Route 7 in Ridgefield, tucked into a roadside building that formerly housed the Cooper Tavern.
Amici (friend in Italian) translates here into a bubbly, cheerful environment with a separate bar to the left of the entrance, and a cozy, low-ceiling dining room on the right.
Smokers may dine in the wood-paneled bar; at dinner, the entire restaurant is a smoke-free zone (there are a few tables at lunch for smokers).


Bookish


In Florida, a Nightmare for Farmers
John Alger has had a string of luck so rotten that when he steps into his flooded fields of sweet corn he can only joke.
"We keep kidding that we rescued three Cuban rafters crossing across here," he said, pointing over the muddy flats where Tropical Storm Gordon turned 630 of his acres into a miniature Straits of Florida.
The storm's wind and rain ruined crops on tens of thousands of acres across the southern half of Florida this week, and vegetable prices are already increasing in some Eastern grocery stores as a result.
But for farmers in Homestead, the crop losses came with an odd twist: although this city south of Miami bore the brunt of Hurricane Andrew in August 1992, its vegetable crops suffered more at the hands of this much weaker tropical storm.

When you write a book about Si Newhouse -- America's richest media tycoon -- you're bound to invite very strong responses.
All that you can hope is that those who review it might do so fairly and ethically.


In America; No G.O.P. Imitations, Please
Representative Charles Schumer put it best: The Democrats created a vacuum and the Republicans filled it.
Mr.
Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said last week: "Any Democrat who wants to revitalize the party has to start from the basic premise that while there were lots of other factors, the Democratic Party was ultimately to blame for the election fiasco. Yes, the Republicans were nasty. Yes, right-wing talk radio emphasized the negative. But those kinds of things can only succeed when there's a vacuum, and we created the vacuum."


On L.I. Golf Courses, the Trend is Organic; Huntington Weighs Privatizing Links
TAKE a number to play on the Crab Meadow Golf Course in the Town of Huntington, if you can.
The crowds at the 18-hole course, critics contend, are evidence of golf's growing popularity.
The Island has 43 public courses, with 34 in Suffolk.
"I could build 10 more tomorrow and I still couldn't satisfy the demand," said Ed Wankel, Suffolk Parks, Recreation and Conservation Commissioner.


'Peter and the Wolf' With Jane Alexander
AS the holidays approach, music for younger listeners crops up more and more frequently.
Today, for instance, the Putnam Symphony Orchestra has invited Jane Alexander, a resident when she isn't in Washington heading the National Endowment for the Arts, to narrate Prokofiev's "Peter and the Wolf."
Ms.
Alexander will tell the tale twice, at 2 and 4 in George Fischer Middle School in Carmel.
Also on the program, conducted by Mark Ettinger, are Leopold Mozart's "Toy" Symphony, with students of the Carmel Schools helping out on penny whistle, ratchet and cuckoo call, and instrumental excerpts from Humperdinck's "Hansel and Gretel."


The Rockets Just Relax And Go With 9-0 Flow
Kenny Smith calls it "ho-hum." Vernon Maxwell's term is "laid back." Robert Horry considers it "not much of a big deal."
These are the Houston Rockets, and for them, a 9-0 start to their National Basketball Association season is not much cause for excitement, or even surprise.
They started last season 15-0 and ended it with an N.B.A. title.


When It Comes To Film Biography, Everyone's a Critic
IF ANY GROUP COULD BE SAID TO have truly lived by their wits, it would be the famed writers and editors, the humorists and poets who gathered for lunch during the 1920's at the Algonquin Round Table, thus affirming their membership in the aristocracy of wit.
The members of the club, which was centered in the restaurant of the eponymous hotel on West 44th Street in Manhattan, were classics of a certain American genre: people from small towns and provincial cities across America who came to New York to be free, to become famous, to get rich.
They were, of course, not the only ones who spent that boisterous epoch creating bodies of work and literary reputations.
Over the seas in London, there was the Bloomsbury circle, and, with less bohemian flair but arguably more literary importance, there was T. S. Eliot, the transplanted businessman's son from St.
Louis who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1948 for canonical works like "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" and "The Waste Land."


Friendly Advice to the Politically Lovelorn
To a nonpolitician, there is an obvious way to deal with the extraordinary feud that has riven New York the last two weeks.
When a relationship is going badly, you turn to an expert.
Dear Ann:
Recently a colleague sought a promotion.
Although he had counted on my support, I backed his rival, and in the heat of the moment I made some nasty personal remarks about him.
Unfortunately, he got the promotion anyway and now controls part of my budget.
I tried to make up with him, but he won't return my telephone calls or meet with me alone.
I know I hurt his feelings, but isn't he being unreasonable?
What can I do?

A Way to Get The Gunmen: Get the Guns
Police departments here and in Kansas City, Mo., have tried something police departments never did before to get illegal guns off the streets: They have focused on the guns in the way they have long focused on drugs and drunken drivers.
Elementary as it sounds, it works.


As Ever, Politics With a Vengeance
GERALD AND SARAH MURPHY, the socialite friends of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, loftily declared that living well was the best revenge.
But politicians are generally a less self-sufficient lot.
Rather than abiding by the Murphys' benign maxim, they are more likely to invoke Machiavelli's darker dictum: "It is much more safe to be feared than to be loved" or Joseph P. Kennedy's credo, "Don't get mad, get even." Politicians typically define revenge as living well at someone else's expense.
Enter, or, perhaps, exit, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
By bolting the Republican Party to embrace Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo for re-election, Mr.
Giuliani gained stature among many of his New York City constituents.
But disloyalty stings even more deeply than defeat.
The Mayor alienated his party, Gov.-elect George E. Pataki (who refused even to engage in a game of telephone tag) and Mr.
Pataki's patron, United States Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
"I'm not going to squish him," a magnanimous Mr.
D'Amato said of the Mayor.
"He's going to squish himself."


At Work; The Work-Family Bottom Line
IT was the early 80's.
Money, fast and lots of it, was in.
Yuppies grazed expensively.
The Italian Peg Perego stroller would soon become the most expensive form of transportation most New Yorkers, at least, would ever purchase.
True, the recession of the early 1980's shook the confidence of a plethora of white-collar professionals, many of whom suddenly found themselves rocked back and in need of new careers.
And true, "having it all" was becoming a dubious goal, as women, especially, found it difficult to juggle the multiple lives anyone with a family and a job has.
Even a decade ago, predownsizing, the demands of work made it virtually impossible to do much more than shoehorn a private life, including spouses and children, into gaps in the work schedule.
The pioneering companies that went looking for support services for their employees found few options.
"It was a simple landscape: a desert," remembers one executive on a tape put together by Work/Family Directions, the Boston-based consulting firm, to observe the beginning of its second decade of purveying the work-family ethic to corporate America.
A decade ago, Work/Family began scouting out child care providers in its clients' local communities, gradually building an infrastructure of referral services around the country.


Carousel
HERE'S HOW THINGS work at the Center of the Universe, also known as New York City: LET'S SAY A REPORTER FOR a certain New York newspaper rushes back from Florida with a story that the First Lady, before anyone ever heard of her, had a real talent for playing the horses.
Seems that in one day alone, with just a minor bit of counseling from her husband's political pals, she turned a $100 bet into $1,000 and then, in a year, she had a $1 million bonanza to finance the start of their campaign for the White House.
The reporter's editors think that's a helluva yarn and run it at the top of their front page.

KILL FOR LIFE
Your profile of militant abortion opponent Roy McMillan was certainly chilling, but once again I found myself wondering why news coverage of "grass roots" abortion activism always focuses on the abortion opponents.
Your article barely acknowledges that a growing corps of pro-choice activists is also gathering outside clinic walls, and in voting booths, across the country.
Among other things, these grass-roots activists act as safe clinic escorts and offer counseling to women who are harassed by people like McMillan.
NANCY M. YANOFSKY Executive Director Pro-Choice Resource Center Mamaroneck, N.Y.


WALKING THE WALK
Television news programs have elevated the perp walk to a new art form through the use of "slo mo" techniques and by rerunning the same film loop (The Big City: "Walking the Walk," by John Tierney, Oct. 30).
A short piece of film can be used for any number of voice-over reports during the booking, trial, sentencing or appeal of a criminal.
In these segments, the perp can be seen going up and down the same stairs, in and out of the same elevator, entering and leaving the same courthouse.
A local Albany station has one film clip of a convicted killer that is rerun each time his sentence is appealed or his case is reviewed by the courts.
FRANCIS W. RODGERS Rensselaer, N.Y.


CHARLES MURRAY
Charles Murray knows he treads on nonpolitically correct ground when he writes of genes and intellect.
Proof of his theories is hard to come by and anecdotal evidence is not science.
However, there is some history that might serve as a clinical trial to prove his thesis on a more scientific basis.
He touched upon it when he paid the Israeli cellist the national compliment: "In terms of I.Q., you guys are off the charts."


Forces Marshaled for Battle on Airport Rail Link
Battle lines are being drawn over a prized Manhattan real-estate site -- the shuttered Alexander's at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue.
Well-financed forces have retained high-powered lawyers in a fight that could rival epic development struggles like Westway and Columbus Circle.
The confrontation has also fostered an unlikely alliance between two frequent adversaries on zoning issues: developers and civic groups.


Clear but Hypocritical
Overlook, for just a moment, the brutality of their ideas.
Representative Newt Gingrich and his band of ideologues have enlivened U.S. politics -- indeed, engaging the public in political discourse that is supposed to be at the core of democratic society.
They ran on a platform that told Americans how they would transform society by, in part, ripping away every strand of the social safety net.
With government out of the way, they said, civil society would bloom.
The Democrats -- led, in the final weeks of the campaign, by President Clinton -- held the contract up to voters for ridicule.
The voters decisively picked sides.


London Fog: Out of the Drizzle and Into the Rain
THE storm clouds were already gathering a year ago for London Fog, but the venerable raincoat maker ventured forth anyway -- with an ambitious plan to reinvigorate itself.

Janet L. Popofsky and Keith Vance
Janet Lynn Popofsky, the daughter of Martin L. Popofsky of North Woodmere, L.I., and the late Elaine Popofsky, was married last evening to Walter Keith Vance, a son of Benjamin Franklin Vance Jr. and Jean C. Lewis, both of Bryan, Tex.
Rabbi Morris S. Friedman performed the ceremony at Temple Hillel in North Woodmere.
Mrs.

She is an associate in the New York office of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, a Los Angeles law firm.


'Dictatorship of Virtue'
To the Editor:
In his review of "Dictatorship of Virtue" (Oct. 23), Leon Wieseltier charges that the author, Richard Bernstein, "flirts with false and ugly notions about the superiority of some civilizations over others," and adds that if "all civilizations are not the same it does not follow that they are not 'equal.'

Welcoming In the Young Wine
The end of November revolves around turkey dinners and family get-togethers.
And, to a lesser but still noticeable extent, there is a holiday tradition imported from France: the arrival of beaujolais nouveau.
This fresh, fruity, two-month-old red wine from south of Burgundy arrives in Paris on the third Thursday in November, where it finds its main market among the solid, casual bistros.
A selection is listed here.

Common Ground: Tax Talk
The talks between major league team owners and players recessed today without an answer to the most crucial question: Will the players accept any part of the payroll tax proposal presented to them this week?
The answer to that question will not be known until at least Nov. 28, the date the players and the owners hope to resume full negotiations.


Can Sinatra's Second Act Top the First?
DOES THE MOST sensational pop stunt of the decade have a viable second act?
That is the inevitable question posed by "Frank Sinatra Duets II," the follow-up to last year's "Duets," which became the singer's best-selling album ever when he was 78.
The answer is a highly qualified yes.
Once again, Mr.
Sinatra displays a punchy (but sometimes punch-drunk) aggressiveness as he recapitulates past triumphs joined by guests who vocally stretch themselves to fit a classic pop mode.
The first album was a conceptual and technological landmark in its teaming of Old Blue Eyes with rock and soul singers like Bono and Aretha Franklin in versions of classic performances that retooled the original arrangements by Nelson Riddle, Don Costa and other Sinatra arrangers.
The fact that the singer and his partners sounded as if they were sitting side by side, even though they had recorded their parts separately, made the feat all the more astounding.


Quebec Police Say Baby Was Target of Cult
A three-month-old boy was stabbed to death in a Quebec village because he was considered the Antichrist in the rituals of a cult linked to the murder-suicide of 53 people in Switzerland and Quebec last month, the Quebec provincial police say.
The police reconstructed the bizarre developments in a burned-out chalet in the ski resort village of Morin Heights, north of Montreal, where five people were found dead early last month.
The incident was followed a few days later by the fiery deaths of 48 cult members in two Swiss villages.


Arnold R. Fox and Yolanda Vega
Yolanda Vega, a daughter of Angel and Rosalina Vega of the Bronx, was married in Manhattan yesterday to Arnold Robert Fox, the son of Charles Fox of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and the late Frances Fox.
Justice Bruce Wright of State Supreme Court in Manhattan officiated at Gilda, a restaurant.
Ms.
Vega, 36, is keeping her name.
She is the director of agency services at Casita Maria, a settlement house in the Bronx.
She graduated from City College, as did her husband, and she received a master's degree in social work administration from Hunter College.

Proud to Be Your Bud, But It Wasn't Working Out
A BUDWEISER advertising slogan from 1911, "The old reliable," could have also described how the brewer, Anheuser-Busch Inc., felt about its advertising agency.
The St.
Louis office of D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles had created campaigns for Budweiser since 1915, making their relationship one of the most enduring in an industry where change is a constant.
So it was startling when Anheuser-Busch abruptly announced last week that it would dismiss D.M.B.&amp; B. after 79 years together.
Starting in February, responsibilities for creating the approximately $125 million worth of Budweiser ads that appear annually will be shifted to DDB Needham Chicago, which handles other Anheuser-Busch accounts.


Funny Things Happen On the Way to a Treaty
IF ever anyone needed evidence that the politics of international trade defy every rule of logic and partisanship, consider the past seven days.
Donning colorful batik in Indonesia, President Clinton claimed his latest victory in commercial diplomacy, as the leaders of Asia agreed to free trade in the Pacific, sort of, by the year 2020.
Of course, it was an accord with some of the world's premier protectionists, and as soon as the cameras wandered off, Mr.
Clinton's summiteers quickly noted that this was a declaration of "common resolve," not a binding agreement.
After all, argued the Chinese and the Malaysians, among others, 25 years might be a little hasty for a radical notion like opening their markets.

WESTCHESTER GUIDE
SECRET LESSONS OF TOYS
"Toys/Art/Us," an exhibition title that echoes the slogan of the toy store chain, describes some less than playful ideas that artists extract from toys.
The exhibition is at the Castle Gallery of the College of New Rochelle through Jan. 20.
Laurie Simmons, for example, does photographic portraits of dolls that are a commentary on "women's work," and Lisa DiLillo's video, "Kitchen Commando," deals with a bored housewife fantasizing that a battle is taking place among her pots and pans.

Silken Badges Bearing Mysterious Messages
THROUGHOUT HISTORY, visual symbols have been used the world over to designate status.
In China, symbols in the form of insignia took on special significance at the beginning of the Ming dynasty.
Around the year 1390, the emperor formalized the use of insignia with an imperial edict: court officials were ordered to display their civil or military rank by distinctive badges affixed to their robes.
The decree remained in force for more than 500 years.
The wealth of silk-embroidered squares produced were emblazoned with brilliantly colored images of birds and animals, each imbued with political and social meaning.
By 1911, at the end of the Ching dynasty, such insignia became obsolete.
But Western tourists and scholars began collecting them as souvenirs and historical documents.

Clinton Plays Dutiful Guest On Vacation At Trip's End
No one can accuse President Clinton of ignoring his hosts.
Mr.
Clinton came to Hawaii for three days of what was to have been rest and relaxation.
The visit was intended as consolation for a schedule that had sent him to two dozen cities in the last four weeks alone.
And for their lodgings here, he and his wife, Hillary, have taken advantage of a prime Presidential perquisite: the ocean-front guest quarters of the big Marine Corps base near here, where President Dwight D. Eisenhower once stayed and which has its own private beach adjoining the magnificent Haneoha Bay.

She graduated from Boston University.
Her father is the vice president of the women's division of Robert Stock, a clothing manufacturer in New York.
Her mother is a psychologist in Beverly Hills, Calif.

Campus Contretemps: A Bronx Tale
Who is Cyrus Azari and why is he saying such terrible things about Fordham University?
Or maybe the question is better asked the other way around.
Mr.
Azari, a 32-year-old Army veteran who transferred to Fordham as a junior this year after graduating from Bergen Community College in New Jersey, has been living in his car in a university parking lot since the beginning of October, after he threatened to beat his roommate and the Fordham administration evicted him from his residence hall.
The result has been a tempest in a teapot, which would be amusing if the weather weren't turning cold.

The fate of three New York City men, including a Melkite Catholic priest, charged in a $7.4 million robbery at an armored-car depot here appears to depend on whether jurors are convinced that a fourth suspect on trial was the inside man on the theft.
Final arguments in the case are scheduled to begin on Monday.


Catching Sight of Past Podium Titans
THERE IS A FABULOUS moment near the end of "The Art of Conducting," a video documentary built around vintage performance clips that show 16 titans of the podium at work (Teldec 95038; laser disk and VHS cassette).
Leonard Bernstein, rehearsing the London Symphony Orchestra in the Shostakovich Fifth Symphony, in 1967, stops the players after a hushed chord and exhorts them to produce an even lighter sound.
"Please, almost no bow," he says in an emotional, urgent tone familiar to anyone who has seen him rehearse or speak about music.
"I mean, just like breathing on the string. I know it goes against your grain as solo violinists to do that, but you must, to get this sonority of voices. It must be like singing, it can't be just" -- he pauses, looks down and adds in a deadpan voice -- "string playing."


St. John's Loses in First Round For the Third Consecutive Year
A goal by Hamisi-Amani Dove with seven minutes left gave Rutgers a 1-0 triumph over St.
John's tonight in the first round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association soccer tournament.
The loss marked the third season in a row in which St.
John's has been eliminated in the opening round.
The Red Storm, which finished the season at 14-5-3, lost to Dartmouth two years ago -- the first time St.
John's made the tournament -- and lost to Boston University last year.


What's New York the Capital of Now?: VOYEURISM; On the Outside Looking In
IT CAN HAPPEN IN A FLASH.
YOU'RE wandering the streets of New York, impervious to the architecture that wallpapers the city, when suddenly you're transfixed, like Alice on a tour of Wonderland, by some extravagant apparition.
A tower.
A dome.
A forest in the sky.
Who's the lucky stiff, you wonder, who gets to rent a castle?
Now, in any other place, the normal reaction might be envy.
But in turf-conscious New York, the skeptic reigns supreme.
Sure, you say, it looks great from the sidewalk, but what about the inside?
Dark and uninhabitable, right?
Well, no, actually.
The sad news is, some of New York's more fascinating exteriors have fascinating interiors as well.


The Hero in Many Guises, A Model for Lesser Mortals
ONE NIGHT THREE CENTURIES ago, the ruler of the small desert kingdom of Bikaner in Western India had a dream.
He saw the god Vishnu, his skin a deep indigo blue, enthroned in a garden pavilion with the goddess Lakshmi seated on his knee.
The fortunate sleeper -- Raja Karan Singh, by name -- awoke, described his vision to his chief court artist, and directed him to capture it in paint.
The idea of the dream became a popular one in the Bikaner court, and a generation of artists painted it repeatedly.
One gorgeous version, depicting the comely young god attended by female musicians, perfectly distills the heady combination of sensuousness and spirituality that makes Indian miniatures so haunting and is among the highlights of a remarkable exhibition titled "Realms of Heroism" at the Brooklyn Museum.


Erwin Griswold of Harvard, Ex-Solicitor General, 90
Erwin N. Griswold, the United States Solicitor General under two Presidents and for many years dean of the Harvard Law School, died yesterday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
He was 90.
Mr.

The Harvard Law School announced his death last night, but the cause was not given.

Caring for the Canine Geriatric Set
MIND if I let the dogs in?" Sony Schotland asked her guest. As Mrs. Schotland's claim to animal-rights fame is adopting elderly dogs, one expected a passive procession of wobbly creatures. Instead the sliding-glass door opened, and three huge mounds of excited caninedom tumbled into the living room.
In a single bound they reached the visitor.
Bo, a German shepherd, flipped his tennis ball into the lap.
Raisins, a spaniel-mix, pounced on feet, sniffing shoes, purse and whatever appendages she could reach.
With head butts, Sheba, a bearded collie, tried to push Raisins, Bo and his ball away, so she could have her head rubbed.


Stamford Plays Its Part
THE executive producer Alexander H. Cohen has more on the agenda of the Rich Forum in Stamford than feeding the Broadway theater.
But somebody's got to do it.
Witness "Comedy Tonight," which is to begin performances on Friday and run through Dec. 11, a 10-day delay from the dates previously announced.


New Columbia Looks an Awful Lot Like Old Columbia
What had developed into a renaissance season for Columbia ended in a nightmare yesterday when the Lions squandered a 24-point lead in the second half as Brown erupted for eight unanswered touchdowns en route to a 59-27 victory.
Ahead by 27-3 early in the second half, Columbia appeared on the way to its sixth victory against three defeats and one tie in the season finale for both teams.
That would have given the Lions their most victories since the 1971 team, the last Columbia squad to record a winning record, went 6-3.
But then this vastly improved Columbia team, which had surprised its most ardent supporters -- not to mention the entire Ivy League -- reverted to the inept form that had characterized Lion teams over most of the last two decades.


On Sunday; Victory Won, Fair Nassau Hails Its Hero
THE title of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's memoir in progress is "Enough Is Enough." If there's no Yoknapatawpha being mapped by his literary muse, there is at least nearby Oceanside and the Rainbow Diner, where his Republican precinct captains gather for breakfast to greet the county judges, the town councilmen, the Congressmen and, above all, the Senator: "Mr. D," as one loyalist hails him with all respect.
Bouncy, jubilant, Mr.
D'Amato must be seen here in his reign as New York's bantamcock champion of the politics of hamlet, town and mansion: the Faulknerian nine yards.
Here his taproot goes deeper than all his cloakroom schemings in Washington and red-meat caperings for the talk-radio carnivore.

Chairman of Joint Chiefs Defends Clinton Against Attack by Helms
Gen.
John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, went out of his way today to reject assertions by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina that President Clinton was not up to the job of Commander in Chief and that many military officials shared that view.
"I was taken aback by the implication that he left that somehow the Joint Chief of Staffs and I shared his view on President Clinton," General Shalikashvili said in a telephone interview.
"Nothing could be further from the truth, and I think it's important to me that this view not be represented as that of the military leadership or for that matter the view of the military as a whole."


For the Elderly, a Deli Is a Lifeline
In Manhattan, getting from one place to another usually involves considering up- or downtown, not up- or downhill.
But for elderly people living along a slice of the island's easternmost avenue, the threat of losing the only deli for a mile is bringing local topography into unusual focus.
"We are at the bottom of a hill," fretted Ursula Maksic, 72 years old, who lives around the corner from the Sutton House Deli, at 1155 York Avenue, between 62d and 63d Streets.
First Avenue, she said, has a variety of stores, but they are inaccessible to her.
"Sixty-Second, 63d and 64th are all uphill streets," she said.
"For elderly people or the handicapped -- I happen to be both -- this is impossible."


Nov. 13-19: Palestinian vs. Palestinian; Arafat's Police Use Guns To Quell Gaza Riots, Killing 13 Protesters
Tensions were building for weeks between Yasir Arafat's struggling self-rule government and Islamic militants in the Gaza Strip, and on Friday the crisis many had feared came to pass.
Armed officers fired repeatedly for hours at stone-throwing protesters, killing at least 13 and wounding perhaps as many as 200.

On the Dull Cutting Edge of Technology
To the Editor:
"A Can Top For a New Day?," (Technology, Oct. 30), reported that the Ball Corporation has come up with a new and improved can-opening device for aluminum and steel drinking cans.
Several years after the latest innovation in such a device -- the pull-tab lid -- I am amazed that anyone got away with a design that involves pushing the sometimes dusty, often sticky and occasionally (surely) filthy outside of a can into the presumably sanitary, pristine contents of the can.
Now it seem that Ball has a new design -- with all kinds of marvelous improvements -- but which still entails pushing the exterior of the can into the contents.
I, for one, remain distinctly unimpressed.

Cab Calloway Is Dead at 86; 'Hi-de-hi-de-ho' Jazz Man

Random Bullet Kills Woman in the Bronx
A Bronx woman walking with her 10-year-old daughter was shot in the back and killed yesterday, apparently by a randomly fired bullet, the police said.
The woman, whom police would not identify, was walking along East 180th Street between Vyse Avenue and Boston Road at about 6:15 P.M. when she was shot, said Sgt.
James Coleman, a Police Department spokesman.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.


North Korea Reports Fulfilling a Nuclear Promise
North Korea has struck its most conciliatory and cooperative note in years, announcing publicly that it had frozen its nuclear reactor program, as promised in an agreement with the United States.
It also vowed to carry out its pledge to dismantle the remaining elements in its suspected nuclear weapons sites, and said over the weekend that it had permitted American experts for the first time to visit its nuclear complex at Yongbyon, just north of the capital.


Trying to Say Absolutely Everything
Nicholas Maw's "Odyssey," nearly two hours long and played without interruption, is a stately rumination on the orchestra.
Leonard Slatkin and the St.
Louis Symphony played it at Carnegie Hall on Friday night, demonstrating if anything Mr.
Slatkin's courage and sense of adventure.
This is not the kind of piece ambitious conductors generally take on out-of-town trips.
"Odyssey" says almost anything you can think of about orchestra sound and technique.
In the process it neither begs, borrows nor steals; nor does it copy or paraphrase.
Mr.
Maw has his own fluid voice and an articulate vocabulary to go with it.
Great banks of brass sound rise.
Birds twitter above flowing lines in the lower strings.
Winds and violins race in scale passages.
Indeterminate chords colored by mallet percussion float out from the stage.
"Odyssey" reads like a thick textbook on how to make 100 skillful musicians do just about anything.


U.N.'s Forces Put on Alert As Serbs Advance in Bosnia
As nationalist Serb forces were reported to have advanced against the Bosnian Army near the town of Bihac, United Nations peacekeepers went on a heightened alert across the country today in anticipation of NATO retaliation for Serbian air attacks on civilian areas.
"The situation is critical in Bihac," said Bosnia's Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic.
He said Serbs, backed by tanks, had retaken the village of Veliki Skocaj south of the Bihac enclave in northwestern Bosnia, which has been designated a "safe area" by the United Nations.

After Frustration, Sampras Hits Winning Note
This time, there was no depriving Pete Sampras of his exclamation point.

Market Place; The final episode approaches in a battered REIT's proxy battle.
ONE of the nastiest election fights of 1994 ends today, after weeks during which the two contestants called each other names and denounced each other's competence and integrity.
The battle is for control of a real estate investment trust that ranks as one of the worst performing of the breed.
Through good times and bad for the industry, American Industrial Properties, as it is now known, has had little but bad news for its investors.
After going public at $15 a share in 1985, its price steadily declined, dipping to $1.25 last month.


POP
Sad Stories And Lonely Characters  Tramps
On Wednesday night, the Ass Ponys, a rock band from Cleveland, took the audience on a tour of the same types of lonely, twisted American characters who fill the pages of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor novels.
In a cracking, tuneful drawl somewhere between that of Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, Chuck Cleaver sang of the man too corpulent to leave his trailer home ("Azalia"), the love-blinded 17-year-old girl who carved "I love Bob" into her calf ("I Love Bob"), and the loner who imagines the women who once drank from the discarded bottles he finds on the ground ("Peanut '93").


Fire Department Ladder Buckles, and a Father Dies
It seemed that the entire family was going to make it to safety yesterday afternoon as yellow and orange flames licked out of a rambling apartment building in a mostly industrial section of Brooklyn.
Standing on a 91-foot aluminum alloy ladder that extended from a fire truck, Firefighter Greg Smith was carrying two children who had been handed through a smoky sixth-floor window on the side of the building by their parents.
The parents came next, and the firefighter stepped down a rung to make room.


Patents; Through Genetic Engineering, Soil Bacteria Develop An Appetite for Sulfur and Help Clean Up Fossil Fuels
GENETIC engineering is frequently used to create drugs or practice biomedicine.
Now a Texas company has patented a recombinant gene that it hopes will help eliminate acid rain.
When sulfur is burned, sulfur oxides are produced; when these are released into the atmosphere they mix with rain, snow or mist and become sulfuric acid.
This falls back to earth to pollute lakes, kill plants and even eat the paint off cars.
A good deal of sulfur gets into the skies through the emissions of power plants, cars, trucks, trains or ships and other devices that burn fossil fuel.

Turner Steals Into Record Book
Until today, Marcus Turner had been the Jets' nickel back nobody knew.
Now he's in their record book.
With three interceptions, including a 90-yard touchdown return, in the 31-21 victory over the Vikings today, the 28-year-old defensive back now shares the Jets' record for most interceptions in one game with Dainard Paulson, Billy Baird, Rich Sowells and Erik McMillan.

Poor Families Will Pay for the G.O.P. Victory
To the Editor:
So Representative Newt Gingrich's tough love solution is to stop "promoting the counterculture value system" and to prevent "the ruin of the poor" (front page, Nov. 13), by cutting all aid to mothers under 21, cutting all aid for legal immigrants and cutting all mothers from welfare and work programs after two years, whether or not jobs or health care are available.


Being Perfect Can Be A Burden
At the end of a weekend of rivalries, a time that defines seasons and determines the futures of coaches, there was one casualty that stood above the others.
The system that creates bowl-game pairings took the worst hit of the weekend, as it faced the possibility that three teams -- Nebraska, Penn State and Alabama -- may reach the new year with perfect records and no chance of facing an unbeaten opponent.
Alabama's passionate 21-14 victory over Auburn, in the brassy din of Legion Field, held far more significance than the annual climax of a state's unending obsession.
The Crimson Tide, with an offense that has become more accomplished and daring as its season progressed, has suddenly become a threat to overtake Penn State and move into position behind top-rated Nebraska in the polls that produce a champion.


Ammirati Gives Up A Sara Lee Account
Ammirati &amp; Puris/Lintas in New York has resigned from one of its Sara Lee Corporation accounts, Bil Mar Foods, as part of its continuing efforts to focus on core accounts.
Bil Mar markets meat products under the Mr.
Turkey name, primarily in the Midwest.
Since 1977, its account has been handled by agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies; Lintas New York, a predecessor of Ammirati &amp; Puris/ Lintas, was awarded the account in 1990.
The agency said Friday that it would continue to handle larger Sara Lee brands like Sara Lee baked goods and Hillshire Farm and Hygrade meat products.


Keeping in Touch With the Victims of Domestic Violence
A son hit his 65-year-old father with a shovel, leaving deep cuts on his left hand.
A young man got into an argument with his live-in girlfriend over their sex life and the argument escalated so furiously that she called 911 out of fear he would beat her.
A man burned his common-law wife's face with a cigarette during a fight.
These brief descriptions of some of the 16 domestic incident reports that Police Officer James O'Donnell reviewed last Monday morning gave only a glimpse of the violence that went on behind closed doors last weekend in the 120th Precinct on the northern part of Staten Island.

Topics of The Times; Fatter and Fatter
Americans continue to grow fatter and fatter at rates that are truly alarming.
Last July, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that 33 percent of all American adults -- one in every three -- were estimated to be overweight.
That was a sharp rise from the already high levels of 24 to 25 percent of all adults recorded as overweight in surveys between 1960 and 1980.
Overweight means about 20 percent or more above a person's desirable weight on standard weight tables.


NATO SET TO BOMB SERBS IN CROATIA
Responding to Serbian nationalist air attacks, NATO has decided to bomb an airfield in a Serbian-held area of Croatia, Western officials said today.
Western officials said that NATO warplanes were ready to bomb the Udbina airfield today, but that the attack was postponed because of bad weather.
Nationalist Serbs have used the airfield as a base for air strikes against the Muslim town of Bihac and other areas of northwest Bosnia, in violation of the United Nations no-flight zone over Bosnia.


Death Penalty
Governor-elect George E. Pataki has promised to restore the death penalty in New York.
But if the experiences of New Jersey and Connecticut are any indication, it will be well into the next century before anyone is actually executed.
Any new death penalty law is likely to be tied up by court challenges for years; most subsequent death sentences will probably be continuously appealed.
In New Jersey, no one has been executed since the state reinstated the death penalty in 1982.
Of the 37 people who have received death sentences since then, 29 have had them reversed on appeal and only 2 others have exhausted their state appeals.
No one has been executed in Connecticut since 1960, but there are growing calls to strengthen the state's death penalty statute.

Why Neil Simon Decided to Turn His Back on Broadway
In his still-definitive 1969 book about the Broadway theater, "The Season," William Goldman predicted that virtually all straight plays would soon be Off Broadway.
The reason, he argued, was simple: the high costs "make doing anything but mass appeal plays a lunatic Broadway venture."
There is no playwright with more mass appeal than Neil Simon, and it has taken 25 years for the prediction to come true for him.
But America's richest, best-known playwright is hunting for a 500-seat Off Broadway theater for his newest comedy, "London Suite."


The Balance Sheet: A Broadway Villain
As Emanuel Azenberg, Neil Simon's producer, puts it: "Off Broadway, 400 seats at $40 makes me a smash. On Broadway, 400 seats at $55 closes me down. You tell me -- what makes sense?"
Producers have moaned for decades that they cannot make money on Broadway, but two recent events suggest that the final act may have arrived: Mr.
Simon decided he would open his new play, "London Suite," Off Broadway, and "Angels in America," the lavishly praised play, announced that it would close at a loss of $660,000.

3 Correction Officers Suspended at Rikers
As sporadic food and work strikes by inmates at Rikers Island continued, three correction officers were suspended on Saturday after refusing to fill in for striking inmates assigned to the food service detail, a Department of Correction spokesman said yesterday.

Cross jail in the Rikers complex were ordered to deliver food to the prisoners -- a job usually performed by inmates -- one officer refused, another overturned a cart of food and a third complained of a back injury.
He said the three were suspended pending a hearing.

The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission also suggests that the board did not seek counsel from its two financial advisers about the legal and legislative liabilities of tobacco when considering the proposed swap of Kohlberg, Kravis's RJR Nabisco stock for Borden.


N.J. Transit Seeks 4 New Electric Rail Lines on Abandoned Tracks
In their glory at the turn of the last century, trolley cars thrived in New Jersey.

Now, modern-day economic and environmental concerns may put electric trains back on their old tracks, at least on four suburban routes being considered by New Jersey Transit.
Some of the service proposed for Passaic, Essex and Union counties would run on active railways, but most would require restoration of dozens of miles of track now buried by weeds or tar.

Aware that the club is considering moving him back to the outfield just one season after they converted him to third base, Bonilla said yesterday that he loved third base, but would do whatever Mets management asked of him.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; It's Frank Lloyd Wright's work on display, but Chrysler's Cirrus sedan is Exhibit A.
THE tag line for advertisements plugging many Chrysler Corporation cars these days is "form follows function." But the auto maker's hope is that dealers' sales forms will follow social functions.
To push its new Cirrus sedan, Chrysler has teamed up with House Beautiful magazine to create a traveling mini-exhibit of work by Frank Lloyd Wright.
Each by-invitation-only opening of the show features plenty of shrimp and grilled chicken bits, a full and free bar, and test drives of the sedans.

Japan Admits It Bungled Notice of War in '41
After decades of obfuscation, Japan stated today for the first time that bungling within the Foreign Ministry 53 years ago was responsible for Japan's failure to declare war on the United States before launching its attack on Pearl Harbor.
The acknowledgement came in documents that were released to clear the air on outstanding questions from the war in advance of the 50th anniversary of Japan's surrender, next Aug. 15.
But the documents are unlikely to resolve the basic issue: why Japan acted as it did.


AIDS Toll on Elderly: Dying Grandchildren
For a long time, Kathleen Buete feared a telephone call saying that her daughter Florence had died of an overdose.
That call never came, but Florence did come home pregnant and with AIDS.
She eventually died and Ms.
Buete is caring for her 8-year-old grandson, who grows weaker and thinner every day from the same virus that killed his mother.
"I scream sometimes for no reason," Ms.
Buete said.
"I have my crying fits. I go into the bathroom so he doesn't see me, but he catches me sometimes."


Arafat Aide Appeals to Israel and Other Nations for Help
In an urgent plea for economic help, the beleaguered Palestinian self-rule government called on Israel today to lift its "siege of starvation" of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, and told foreign countries that the time was "now or never" to carry out their unfulfilled pledges of aid.
Still reeling from fighting that killed at least 13 Gazans and wounded about 200 others on Friday, officials turned their attention to what many here regard as a basic cause of unrest: embedded poverty despite all the hopes raised when Yasir Arafat's Palestinian Authority came into being half a year ago.


Africa Tunes In to a BBC Beacon
Every afternoon at 5:05, local time, work in many offices throughout this continent comes to a halt when a staccato trumpet burst signals the beginning of "Focus on Africa," a hard-hitting BBC news program broadcast on shortwave radio.
Much of Africa has experienced a democratic renewal in this decade, with the sprouting of opposition parties and the creation of a diverse and often highly critical news media.
This situation has sorely tested the relevance of the London and Paris press, and other shortwave broadcasters like the staid Voice of America and Radio France International.
For decades, these organizations provided the news that many African journalists were not free to report in their own countries.


Looking for Meaning in Parents' Deaths, Finding It in History
FAMILY  By Ian Frazier  Illustrated. 386 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $23.
In the sad aftermath of one's parents' deaths, a sweet recompense is the gradual crystallization in memory of the best of those parents.
Ian Frazier's father and mother died in their late 60's almost within a year of each other, he in 1987 of Alzheimer's disease and pneumonia, she in 1988 of liver cancer.
The memories evidently came back with such force and sweetness that Mr.
Frazier was driven beyond mere recollection to an appetite for his family's entire history.


CLASSICAL MUSIC
Ax and Serkin Unite For Brahms and Schoenberg  Carnegie Hall
Brahms was the most radical of conservatives, Schoenberg the most conservative of radicals.
In a series of well-thought-out concerts this season, the pianist Emanuel Ax is putting the two composers on equal terms.
On Wednesday night, Mr.
Ax was joined by Peter Serkin for a two-piano program that brought together Brahms's Variations on a Theme of Haydn, Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 2 (the composer's own arrangement) and Brahms's Sonata in F minor (Op. 34, not Op. 5).


Have Meat Cleavers. Will Juggle.
The simple, striking set for "The Flying Karamazov Brothers Do the Impossible!" is a mountain of cardboard boxes piled at the rear of the Helen Hayes Theater's stage.
During the new show starring the popular West Coast troupe of comic jugglers, boxes are tossed, juggled, stacked, and balanced precariously on people's chins.
Before the show is over, the cardboard mountain, as if sick and tired of being treated as a plaything, spontaneously erupts, burying everything, including the performers.
The Flying Karamazov Brothers, who first appeared on Broadway 11 years ago, have always made it a point to create theater from humble materials.
Having started out on the streets of San Francisco, they convey the cheerfully anarchic attitude of unreconstructed hippies.
And in the show's more exuberant moments, the troupe, which includes a ragtag street band called the Kamikaze Ground Crew, makes the audience part of its extended family.

DOLE TIES SUPPORT OF TRADE ACCORD TO TAX CONCESSION
Seeking to wring concessions from a politically weakened White House, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas said today that he had told Clinton Administration officials that he would be more inclined to vote for a worldwide trade pact if the White House dropped certain objections to a cut in the capital gains tax.
Administration officials said today that they had promptly dismissed the offer made by Senator Dole, the likely majority leader.


CHRONICLE
DAVID CROSBY of the rock group Crosby, Stills and Nash received a new liver yesterday in a seven-hour operation.
A spokesman for the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center, Warren Robak, said that Mr.
Crosby was in critical condition after the operation, which was normal for organ transplant patients, The Associated Press reported.


Tortoise, Hare and Corporate Japan
If Aesop had written business school case studies instead of fables, he could have hardly done better than the tale told last week by the Sony Corporation and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company about their forays into movie making.
When the two Japanese companies acquired major Hollywood studios five years ago, Sony -- innovative, flashy and far more comfortable in the international arena -- was viewed as the better candidate of the two for success.
Matsushita -- a cautious giant that stressed conformity -- seemed to be bogged down in ways that were antithetical to the ethos of Hollywood.


At Conference Of Governors, Pataki Makes A Quiet Debut
A year ago, when the Republican Governors' Association met in Phoenix, it was Christine Todd Whitman's show, a coming-out party for a new political star who had toppled a Democratic incumbent by promising deep cuts in state income taxes.
This year, Governor-elect George E. Pataki of New York used a similar playbook to unseat perhaps the most prominent governor in the country.
But he is just a face in the crowd at this year's meeting, just one of 11 Republicans about to take over statehouses that were previously Democratic or independent.

What Now for Mr. Clinton?
Give President Clinton and his associates this.
They are not blaming the baseball strike or sun spots for the election results.
They are also taking Representative Newt Gingrich and his "Contract With America" seriously.
For anyone who cares about the two-party system, these are good signs.
There are, of course, delusional Democrats who believe that the new Republican majority will turn out to be so right-wing that all Bill Clinton has to do is stand aside and wait for Mr.
Gingrich to self-destruct.
That is a shaky and probably suicidal premise on which to base the revival of the Democratic Party and Mr.
Clinton's Presidency.
The Congress Mr.
Gingrich promises will not be a do-nothing bunch like the Republicans Harry Truman savaged 46 years ago, but a do-something Congress in Mr.
Gingrich's radical mold.
If the President wishes to salvage any honor from the next two years, he is obliged to do something in return.

Poison in the Earth: A special report.; Nuclear Roulette for Russia: Burying Uncontained Waste
For more than three decades, Russian scientists have disclosed, the Soviet Union and now Russia secretly pumped billions of gallons of atomic waste directly into the earth.
They say the practice continues today.
Though the Russians defend the practice as safe, it is at odds with accepted global standards for nuclear waste disposal and is contrary to what they have previously said they were doing.
The disclosure has set off a debate among experts over the likely consequences of the radioactive injections, which some experts say represent a new kind of nuclear danger that might haunt the planet for centuries.


Inmate Accused of Plot to Kill Two Prosecutors and a Judge
A 33-year-old convicted killer has been arraigned on charges he conspired to assassinate District Attorney Richard A. Brown of Queens, an assistant prosecutor and the judge who handed him a life sentence.
The suspect, Armando Hernandez, was arraigned on Saturday in Queens Criminal Court in Kew Gardens on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and criminal solicitation, officials said yesterday.
He was arrested on Friday at the Bronx House of Detention, where he was awaiting transfer to a state prison, according to documents filed at the court.


Ewing Still In Doubt For Knicks
When David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs goes up for the game-opening tap against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Monday night, it may be Herb Williams instead of Patrick Ewing who goes along for the ride.
Ewing, who sat out Saturday night's 92-79 Knicks victory over Atlanta at the Garden because of soreness and swelling in his right knee, did not practice with the team today and is questionable for the San Antonio game.


Topics of The Times; The Economics of Prenatal Care
Fearing that purely altruistic social arguments would never carry the day, health care advocates have long claimed that the expense of offering prenatal care to poor women would be more than offset by the savings in preventing premature births and other costly problems.
But now Dr.
Frederick Cornell, who directs maternal and child-health programs at the University of Washington in Seattle, and Dr.
Jane Huntington, a Seattle internist, have analyzed the more than 100 papers on which that contention was based -- and found them flawed.
Those who do not receive timely prenatal care are predominantly poor minorities at high risk of having premature and low-birth-weight babies.
Reducing that risk, the doctors say, takes a kind of care -- identifying and treating drug and alcohol abuse, for example -- far more comprehensive than that provided by the average prenatal program.
That takes more money.


Insurance Plan for Gay Partners
California regulators are pushing insurance companies to change their rules so that a member of a homosexual couple may buy life insurance on the other partner, and name himself or herself as beneficiary.
The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company recently agreed to pay the state $125,000 to settle charges that it had denied insurance coverage to people who wanted to name an unrelated person as beneficiary.
The Allstate Life Insurance Company and The Jackson National Life Insurance Company had earlier paid similar fines.


An Annual Review By Turkish Tourism
The Turkish tourist office in New York is conducting a review, required annually, on its North American account, which has been handled by D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles in Toronto.
Billings were estimated at $2.5 million.

A decision is expected by the end of December or early January, she added.


Last-Play Block Saves Nets an Embarrassment
P.

Myriad hands reached out from the stands for him to slap jubilantly as he headed for the tunnel to the locker room.
He had saved the Nets from an embarrassing defeat with a last-second block of a Pooh Richardson layup, but he had trouble relating to the euphoria the fans were feeling.


Seinfeld as Opening Act For Abbott and Costello
Odd as it may seem, NBC's hit series "Seinfeld," usually identified as the most contemporary approach to the television sitcom, owes a lot to Bud Abbott and Lou Costello.
It may be hard to imagine how that comedy pair from the 1940's and 50's, often written off by critics as lowbrow slapstick merchants, could influence the comedy show that has come to be considered a cultural signpost for relationships in the 1990's.
But Jerry Seinfeld himself has no qualms about making the connection.


Angolan Government and Rebels Sign Treaty to End 19-Year War
The enemies who have fought since 1975 for control of Angola signed a treaty here today promising to end the last war in southern Africa and to collaborate in rebuilding their rich and devastated country.
The accord, which calls for the guns to fall silent on Tuesday, is the third such pledge to end Angola's relentless fratricide.
But it is the first to guarantee a share of power to the Unita rebel movement, and the first to be backed by plans to deploy thousands of armed United Nations peacekeepers.

G.O.P. GOVERNORS CAUTION CONGRESS ON SOCIAL AGENDA
Buoyed by their biggest victory in 25 years, the nation's Republican governors and governors-elect sought today to put some distance between themselves and the Republicans who will control Congress.

Since the New York State Senate, like the Assembly, is now apportioned by population, Philip S. Glickman urges adoption of a unicameral legislature (letter, Nov. 14).

METRO DIGEST
GRANDPARENTS IN THE AGE OF AIDS
As the AIDS epidemic rages, grandmothers across the nation are increasingly thrust into an old role with a new twist: they are caring for adult children dying of AIDS and for the grandchildren, in some cases also dying, who are left behind.
Heterosexual AIDS infection jumped 130 percent from 1992 to 1993 (an increase due in part to a change in definition), and experts estimate that as many as 125,000 children will lose their mothers to AIDS by the year 2000.
These children are increasingly left in the care of relatives, family friends and social agencies.


Clinton's Grip On '96 Ticket Isn't So Sure
It is still only a question, but a politically portentous one, and it is on the lips and in the minds of prominent Democrats across the country: Can Bill Clinton -- should Bill Clinton -- be the party's Presidential nominee in 1996?
So sweeping was the Democratic defeat in the elections 13 days ago, and so deep is the Democratic dejection in its wake, that the President's place at the head of the ticket two years from now is no longer taken for granted.
The odds are strongly in his favor: he is still the President, and he has few obvious challengers.
But the doubts are there.


Time for a Global Criminal Court
After extensive and complicated preparations, the United Nations ad hoc tribunal to investigate war crimes in the former Yugoslavia is just now getting started.
Two weeks ago, the massacres in Rwanda were added to its jurisdiction.
But these two examples of human rights disasters are by no means the only ones deserving the attention of the international community.
What of the crimes of the Haitian junta?
The Indonesian Army in East Timor?
Turkish and Iraqi persecution of the Kurds?
It would be impossible to convene ad hoc tribunals to investigate all these -- yet it seems inherently unfair that some conflicts are singled out for world attention when others, whose victims are every bit as human, are ignored.

But the land here in Quang Tri Province is so unproductive that even when prices go up the effect for most farmers can be measured in pennies.

Extended Family Of Immigrants Mourns Victims Of Van Accident
Balbir Singh's family left the Indian state of Punjab in the kind of serial migration that has been an article of faith for immigrants to the United States for more than a century.
First came his brother-in-law, then his sister and her son, and then, in 1989, Mr.
Singh.
Looking for economic opportunity and an escape from the civil strife in Punjab, they settled together in Flushing, Queens, and became part of the Sikh community whose life revolves around a temple in the Richmond Hill neighborhood.
Mr.
Singh delivered newspapers until two years ago, when his sister, Kulwant Singh, got him a job at the National Wholesale Liquidators Store where she worked, in Bethpage, L.I.
He quickly rose to assistant manager, and frequently drove a company-owned van in which other store employees who lived in Queens rode to work in a car pool.

RESULTS PLUS
WOMEN'S SOCCER  Ninth Crown in Row for North Carolina  North Carolina's women's soccer team captured its ninth consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Association title in remarkable style yesterday with a 5-0 rout of Notre Dame as midfielder Tisha Venturini, a senior, scored two goals.
Except for the loss to George Mason in the 1985 championship game, North Carolina has captured the title every year since the N.C.A.A. instituted the women's tournament in 1982.
After a fairly close game before intermission, the Tar Heels erupted for four goals in the second half to hand Notre Dame (22-1-1) its only loss of the season.
The Tar Heels finished at 25-1-1, with their only loss coming against Duke and their tie against Notre Dame earlier in the season.
MEN'S SOCCER  Two Upsets as N.C.A.A.
Play Starts  Two big upsets marked the first round of the N.C.A.A.
Division I men's tournament yesterday.
North Carolina defeated host South Carolina, last year's runner-up, 1-0, on a goal by Mark Jonas in the 17th minute and fourth-seeded North Carolina-Charlotte suffered a 1-0 overtime loss to the College of Charleston.
Virginia, the defending by beat North Carolina-Greensboro, 3-0.
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL  Tennessee Takes Tip-Off Classic  Dana Johnson scored 10 points in a 14-2 run that started the second half yesterday, helping top-ranked Tennessee to a 69-62 victory over Louisiana Tech at the State Farm Hall of Fame Tip-Off Classic in Jackson, Tenn.
The run pulled the Lady Vols (1-0) ahead, 45-32.
They built the cushion to 60-43 before the Lady Techsters took advantage of 5 turnovers to score 11 straight points and cut the lead to 60-54 with 47 seconds left.
Debra Williams, who finished with 23 points, had 5 during that run.
Louisiana Tech was forced to foul at that point, and point guard Michelle Marciniak hit 4 straight free throws to put Tennessee out of reach, 68-59, with 30 seconds left. (AP) FIELD HOCKEY  James Madison Triumphs in Overtime  Gwen Stoltzfus's shot in overtime clinched James Madison's 2-1 victory over top-ranked North Carolina for the N.C.A.A. field hockey championship yesterday in Brookline, Mass.
After two scoreless 15-minute overtimes, Stoltzfus clinched James Madison's first crown in the stroke-off when she beat North Carolina goalkeeper Jana Withrow with a hard, low shot.
The Dukes (20-3-1) won the shootout, 4-2.
No. 1 North Carolina finished 21-2. (AP) HORSE RACING  Tabasco Cat Up Track in Grass Debut  Tabasco Cat, the Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner, failed miserably in his first attempt at grass racing.
He finished eighth yesterday, more than six lengths behind the victorious River Flyer, in the $400,000 Hollywood Derby at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, Calif.
After settling into fourth place early in yesterday's mile-and-an-eighth race, Tabasco Cat, the 2-1 favorite with Pat Day aboard, found room to rally along the rail at the top of the stretch, but he had no punch and dropped back.
River Flyer, ridden by Chris Antley, won his fourth straight race on the turf in 1:472/5 and paid $10 for $2 to win.
Dare and Go took second.
GOLF  3 Weeks, 3 Championships for Ozaki  Jumbo Ozaki birdied the final hole yesterday for his third victory in three weeks, a one-shot triumph over Tom Watson in the Dunlop Phoenix event in Miyazaki, Japan.
The 47-year-old Ozaki came from behind with a seven-under-par 65, finishing at 15-under 201 in the tournament, which was shortened to 54 holes because of rain.
Watson missed three birdie putts in a row from less than 8 feet on the 15th, 16th and 17th holes and left a tying 25-foot eagle putt on the last hole 2 feet short. (AP) GYMNASTICS  Romanian Women First, U.S.

"McDonald gave us that strike with the kickoff return." Chaminade's James Byrne threw for 197 yards and a touchdown.

Cutting Medicaid Will Not Be Easy
THERE is no debate about it.
New York's Medicaid system, the kudzu of health-care programs, needs pruning.
It is one of the most expensive and expansive Medicaid programs in the country, and Governor-elect George E. Pataki has pledged to cut it.
But how?
New York has done such a masterly job of wringing dollars out of the Federal Government, which pays half of all Medicaid bills, that the program has spawned a vigorous lobby of clients and providers.

Filing Raises New Questions About Borden
New information in a regulatory filing about Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Company's proposed acquisition of Borden Inc. shows that a financial adviser to Borden had a $10 million incentive to complete the deal with Kohlberg, Kravis at the same time another suitor was trying to meet with the Borden board.
The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission also suggests that the board did not seek counsel from its two financial advisers about the legal and legislative liabilities of tobacco when considering the proposed swap of Kohlberg, Kravis's RJR Nabisco stock for Borden.

Mental Patient Is Accused of Killing Another
A man who by reason of insanity was acquitted of murder 10 years ago walked out of a state psychiatric center in Brooklyn Saturday evening, then, after returning almost 12 hours later, stabbed a fellow patient to death, most likely with a knife obtained while roaming the city, the police said.
The ease with which Daniel Alvarez, 48, escaped from the Kingsboro State Psychiatric Center and then was able to get a knife past officials raised new questions about the security and operation of the aging, state mental health center at 681 Clarkson Avenue in Flatbush.

Takeover Fight Transfixes the Swiss
In Switzerland, discreet finance and genteel business manners are a way of life, and the rare corporate takeover is quietly handled behind closed doors.
But now the Swiss are getting their full share of a knock-down, drag-out fight over control of the country's largest financial institution, the Union Bank of Switzerland.
The bank is so big that its global assets nearly equal Switzerland's gross national product, but that has not put off Martin Ebner, a rich, brash Swiss financier whose actions are in the tradition of American takeover specialists like Carl C. Icahn and T. Boone Pickens.

A new crop of publications has sprouted here in the last year or so, a wide-ranging collection of quarterlies, bimonthlies and weeklies.
"Washington gets a lot of grief for being a cow town, but along with being slower paced, it's a more thoughtful place," said Steven G. Smith, editor of Civilization, a new bimonthly.
"It's a place that lends itself to reflection on issues and the nature of society. It's an ideal place to sit back and make sense of things."

A Peace Pact? Only If It's Genuine
The Likud movement firmly supports Israel's peace treaty with Jordan.
In Camp David as in Madrid, we sought an end to war.
What we seek today are peace agreements that will endure beyond the ceremonies of yesterday and those of tomorrow.
Happily, this is the prospect offered by the treaty with Jordan.
This peace is a blessing, yet it is not immediately obvious.
History is replete with examples of real peace alongside frequent examples of false peace.
Some peace agreements have pushed back war, others have ushered in the most horrific tragedies.

Takeover Of Kemper Is Dropped
Unable to finance its proposed takeover of the Kemper Corporation and having seen its stock price plunge 27 percent since it made the offer, Conseco Inc. yesterday called off the $3.25 billion deal.
The move came after Citibank, the lead lender, indicated that it probably would not be able to finance even a lowered bid, one person close to the negotiations said.
Rising interest rates had made the loans needed to complete the deal more expensive while depressing the value of Kemper's brokerage and mutual fund businesses.


When a Composer Turns Opera Upside-Down
Robert Ashley's "Now Eleanor's Idea" is opera seen in a mirror.
Its musical stagecraft operates backward.
Here's one nice role reversal that runs through these four one-act pieces at the Brooklyn Academy of Music: Projected surtitles in the opera house ordinarily tell audiences what singers onstage are saying.
In Mr.
Ashley's scheme of things, surtitles appear as chapter headings or topics, often mysterious.
The performers fill you in on what they mean.


Essay; Self-Deportation?
The victory in California of the movement to deny schooling and medical services to illegal immigrants who are not actually bleeding to death is the first skirmish in the war on unwed welfare mothers.
That's because both Proposition 187 (punishing some 300,000 alien schoolchildren for the sins of their fathers) and the Gingrich approach to welfare reform (withholding support when unemployed single mothers have additional children) are based on this philosophy: the most cost-effective way to change behavior is to make life unbearable under present behavior.

Cowboys Win One, Lose Two (Passers)
The Dallas Cowboys' suddenly fragile quarterback situation came down to this today at Texas Stadium: Tight end Jay Novacek was one injury away from playing quarterback for the first time since he earned all-state honors at Gothenburg High School in Nebraska.
Sound funny?
It wasn't to the Cowboys, who easily defeated the Redskins, 31-7, before 64,644, but saw Troy Aikman leave the game late in the second quarter with a sprained left knee and his backup, Rodney Peete, depart in the fourth quarter with a sprained right thumb.
The emergency third-string quarterback, Jason Garrett, seeing his first action of the season, survived until the finish.
If he had gone down, Novacek would have been called on to direct the Cowboys' offense.


Death Outruns a Play From 1977
"You get tired of keeping it all inside," says a terminally ill man in "The Shadow Box," the Michael Cristofer play that has been revived at the Circle in the Square Theater, "but it's like nobody wants to hear about it."
In 1977, when "The Shadow Box" opened on Broadway, American audiences generally didn't want to hear much about their own mortality, and certainly not in clinically specific terms.
Mr.
Cristofer's play, which portrayed three cancer patients facing death in a California hospice, seemed to represent a significant breakthrough in subject matter if not in form.
While critics expressed reservations about its dramatic contrivances, nearly everyone agreed it was a moving and worthy effort, and it won a Pulitzer Prize.

CBS Hopes That Letterman Can Help Prime-Time Woes
For David Letterman, who revolutionized late-night television a year ago, the pressure to keep winning is unrelenting.
Tonight he faces the challenge of simultaneously proving himself and holding up a faltering network -- not once, but twice.
"We recognize that we have to keep on hammering," Mr.
Letterman said in a telephone interview late last week.
"We don't want anybody to take it away from us."


Rightist Coalition Falters In Local Italian Elections
More than 2.6 million Italians voted today in local elections, and early computer projections seemed to confirm that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia party had lost some glitter since the party came to power in March.
The ballot for mayors and local councils in 242 cities and towns involved just over one-twentieth of Italy's 47 million voters.
The political battle was fought on matters ranging from the allure of local personalities to national issues.


In 'Jihad in America,' Food for Uneasiness
The review tape of "Jihad in America" was heralded by a complaint from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim organization in Washington, that PBS had denied requests by Arab and Muslim journalists to screen the program in advance of tonight's scheduled showing at 10:10 P.M. on Channel 13.
The council charged that Steven Emerson, the documentary's executive producer, had shown animus toward the Palestinian cause as a journalist and was promoting "a wild theory about an Islamic terrorist network in America."
Whatever the predilections of Mr.
Emerson, who has made a specialty of investigating Muslim fundamentalist terrorism, the protesters' concerns prove understandable (which is not to say the pressure to change or cancel the documentary was justified), since "Jihad in America" is likely to awaken viewers' unease over what some some Muslim groups here may be up to.

Patents; Through Genetic Engineering, Soil Bacteria Develop An Appetite for Sulfur and Help Clean Up Fossil Fuels
GENETIC engineering is frequently used to create drugs or practice biomedicine.
Now a Texas company has patented a recombinant gene that it hopes will help eliminate acid rain.
When sulfur is burned, sulfur oxides are produced; when these are released into the atmosphere they mix with rain, snow or mist and become sulfuric acid.
This falls back to earth to pollute lakes, kill plants and even eat the paint off cars.
A good deal of sulfur gets into the skies through the emissions of power plants, cars, trucks, trains or ships and other devices that burn fossil fuel.

Yet More Intraparty Strife Among Republicans, This Time in the City Council
For a while, they seemed a fairly merry little band of legislators.
But through a combination of smoldering animosities and the fallout from other political feuds, the seven Republicans on the City Council are demonstrating that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Governor-elect George E. Pataki are not alone in bitter bickering within their party.
The dispute erupted openly last week over the position of minority leader on the Council.
Since February, the position has been held by Michael J. Abel, a Republican from Bayside, Queens, who supports Mr.
Giuliani.
But last week Thomas V. Ognibene, a Conservative who represents Middle Village and Glendale in Queens, declared himself the new minority leader after gathering the signatures of four of the Council's seven Republicans on a petition.


After 30 Months of Nearly No Luck, Sabatini Finally Gets All the Breaks
In less than two hours yesterday, Gabriela Sabatini ended two and a half years of frustration.

U.S. to Sell Bills and Notes
The Treasury's schedule of financings this week is confined to bills and notes, beginning with today's auctions of two-year notes and three- and six-month bills.
On Tuesday, the Government will auction five-year notes.
By the close of the New York cash market on Friday, traders said, the rate on the outstanding three-month bill was 5.33 percent and on the six-month bill, 5.78 percent.
In when-issued trading, the two-year note was being offered at a rate to yield 7.28 percent and the five-year at a rate to yield 7.81 percent.


PRO FOOTBALL: Sports of The Times; When the 'Best' Must Be the 'Best' One More Time
When the Jets had to win, they produced their best game this season and their best game in Boomer Esiason's two seasons.
But with first place in the American Conference East at stake next Sunday against the Miami Dolphins at "the Meadowlands," the Jets now must play that "best game" again in order for yesterday's 31-21 triumph over the Vikings to mean much.


School Board To Face Cuts Of 800 More
In response to continuing budget cuts by City Hall, Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines plans to reduce the Board of Education's administrative staff by additional 800 employees by June, a board official said yesterday.
As a result, the central staff will have been cut by about a third since the beginning of this year -- almost as much as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has demanded.
Mr.
Cortines is to announce the reductions in testimony this morning before the City Council, which is holding hearings on the effects of Mayor Giuliani's plan to close a $1.1 billion gap in the city's budget for the current fiscal year.
The Mayor has called for a $190 million cut to the school system.


An Airline Fears Cairo Will Kill It With Rules
Amir Zarkani set out 13 years ago to establish a private airline company in Egypt.
But like many businessmen who have tried to buck government monopolies, he feels that he is being driven out of business by capricious regulations intended to safeguard the Government-owned Egypt Air.
The latest campaign against the ZAS airline illustrates why significant foreign investment still eludes Egypt and why the huge state corporations continue to dominate 80 percent of the Egyptian economy.
More important, it highlights the lucrative concessions paid by Government-owned industries to relatives of high officials, including the two sons of President Hosni Mubarak, and the lavish salaries paid to the managers of these industries, although many are losing money.


STEEL PRICE DISPUTE CONTINUES WITH AUTO MAKER
The automotive and steel industries continue to argue about price increases.
The trade journal Automotive News reported yesterday that the General Motors Corporation had broken off steel pricing talks with an important supplier, the Inland Steel Company.
But other people close to the negotiations said yesterday that the companies were back at the bargaining table.
The demand for steel is booming this year, and steel companies are trying to improve their profitability by pushing through price increases.
Earlier this year, the Chrysler Corporation signed agreements that steel industry consultants said included percentage increases averaging in the high single digits.


Stocks Dive Steeply in Last Minutes of Trading
For much of yesterday, stock prices simply drifted downward for the third session in a row, but then suddenly plunged headlong in the last 15 minutes of trading.

"Don't just blame the computers, though," said Todd Clark, senior director of equities trading at Mabon Securities Inc.
"There was real selling going on here by human beings, and the computers came in at the end."

Abex Friction Products will become part of Cooper's Automotive Products segment.
Cooper makes automotive products including Anco windshield wipers, Champion spark plugs and Moog chassis parts.

A Pivotal Day for Talks To Save Hockey Season
Today could be a pivotal day in the 53-day National Hockey League lockout.
Bargainers will meet early this morning in Boston to try to save the season.
Negotiations between the two sides broke off around 11 P.M. last night after a seven-hour session.
If no agreement is reached today, it is expected they will be recessed until after the Thanksgiving holiday.


Carjacking Defendant Says Victim Is Lying
In an uncommon display of irritation on the witness stand, Edward L. Summers today called the surviving victim of a January carjacking a liar and a fraud for telling authorities that Mr.

However, when Kenneth Gribetz, the Rockland County District Attorney, asked him to enumerate the lies that Scott Nappi, wounded in the carjacking, told in his testimony, Mr.
Summers seemed to focus on relative trivia.

He called party leaders across the state and, and in his deep and fatherly monotone, reassured them.


By Design; Like a Corset, Only Less So
Back in Victorian days, the lady's maid laced her mistress into a corset to give her the hourglass figure that fashion dictated.
Now designers build corselets right into party dresses (after all, who has a personal maid?).
And because women today don't want to suffer too much discomfort to be fashionable, the corselet dresses depend more on clever seaming than on stiff boning to slenderize the torso.
Bloomingdale's has all kinds of bustiers, corselets and corselet dresses in its windows this week. (There's even a corselet swimsuit by Gottex in silver or gold for $126 that can actually go in the water.)


Agent Shoots Man With Knife on Subway
An F.B.I. agent shot a knife-wielding passenger on a subway train in lower Manhattan yesterday after the agent ordered him to drop the knife and the man continued to approach the agent, law enforcement officials said.
The man, identified as Joseph Santulli, 43, of Brooklyn, was hit in the stomach by one bullet from the agent's 9-millimeter pistol.
Mr.
Santulli was taken to St.
Vincent's Hospital, where he underwent surgery and was in critical condition last night in the intensive-care unit.


Mercy Killing in Canada Stirs Calls for Changes in Law

Diaper-clad and weighing 38 pounds, she could not walk, talk or feed herself.

A Renewed Modern: More of a Museum Or More Modern?

How is the archetypal museum of the 20th century to survive into the 21st?
Or to put it as Stein might have, how can the Modern remain modern after modernism?

In addition, it will use the bottom portion of television screens for local movie theater listings, showing when and where movies are playing near subscribers' homes.
The companies have not yet decided how local the listings will be, a spokeswoman for the Times Company said.

Predictability With Surprises
Perhaps the key to the success of Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's music is its predictability.
Normally, that would not seem an ideal attribute for new music, but Ms.
Zwilich's work appears to proceed from the assumption that too much has been made of the need for novelty, and that listeners actually hate being entirely in the dark.
So in her Concerto for Violin and Orchestra, which was given its New York premiere at a New York Chamber Symphony concert at the 92d Street Y on Saturday evening, listeners could tap their feet without tripping on many rhythmic snares, and could usually guess how stretches of the piece would play themselves out.
But Ms.
Zwilich also played a competing card.
By avoiding standard structural forms and allowing her two movements to unfold episodically, she retained occasional elements of surprise.


Terror Conspiracy Trial Delayed
A Federal judge yesterday again postponed the terror conspiracy trial of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and 11 other men, accused of plotting to blow up New York City landmarks in a war of urban terrorism against the United States.

When the Ukrainian leader, Leonid Kuchma, meets with President Clinton at the White House on Tuesday, he will very likely be praised for moving in the last month to reform the economy and to persuade his truculent Parliament to rid the nation of nuclear weapons.
The Parliament's ratification last week of the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear arms means that the long-sought goal of eliminating those weapons is a done deal.
But living up to tough economic conditions set by the International Monetary Fund last month is hitting road blocks.

Nearly 20 years after its inception, the Wooster Group is looking eerily prophetic.
The company, a longtime bastion of downtown hipness for experimental theater devotees, has always specialized in mixed-media collages that reflect a world of ever-shifting, technologically generated ephemera.
Today, of course, this is the stuff, however unwittingly, of mainstream entertainment.
People go the racetrack to watch the races on televisions positioned in trees.
At rock concerts, an audience's attention wanders between what's onstage and the close-ups of performers on giant monitors.
And in Broadway musicals, mechanized amplification has made it increasingly difficult to tell from which actors the voices are coming.

The gangs are said to consist largely of soldiers of the defeated Rwandan Army.
United Nations officials have said that as many as 30,000 of these former soldiers and the militias allied with them may be in the camps controlling the distribution of food and relief supplies and terrorizing the hundreds of thousands of refugees living there.

New York City's Budget Cuts
The New York City budget for the current year is at least $1 billion out of balance.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has proposed cuts to balance it, and City Council members seem ready to accept his overall estimate.
But they do not accept each and every cut he would make to reach that total, especially cuts in social service programs.
Negotiations to resolve their differences are under way -- in secret.
Past practice indicates that a settlement will be reached and immediately approved with no more than a momentary public glimpse of what was agreed.
Given the huge impact of cutting so much from programs that have already been cut once this year, the public deserves thorough hearings on the agreement and the rationale behind its cuts.


Corrections
An article on Monday about Senator Bob Dole's linking of support for a world trade pact to a cut in the capital gains tax referred incorrectly in some editions to the relationship between a tax cut and a change in Federal budget rules.
If the overall economic effects of a tax cut are counted in a manner suggested by Republicans, it can be enacted without matching cuts in Federal spending.

G.O.P. Splits on Dole Threat on Trade Pact
Republicans split today over the decision of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas to hold a worldwide trade agreement hostage to tax concessions from the White House.
While a prominent Republican strategist warned against the move, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a supporter of the pact, said he would not interfere with Mr.
Dole's effort.
Meanwhile, Democrats worried that the uncertainty over whether the Senate would ultimately approve the pact could erode support for the agreement in the House, where it previously seemed headed for an easy victory.


Chess
Tournaments and matches with predesignated openings were not uncommon a century ago, but they are rare nowadays.
One current exception was the Polugayevsky Tournament in Buenos Aires, Oct. 12 to 31.
In this event, sponsored by the Dutch entrepreneur Joop Van Oosterom to celebrate the 60th birthday of the Russian grandmaster Lev Polugayevsky, everyone had to play the open lines of the Sicilian Defense in every game, and, of course, with White, they had to start with 1 e4 and cooperate to create Sicilians.
Both the site and the choice of opening came at the request of the honored guest, Polugayevsky, who has been famous throughout his career for adopting the Sicilian and has a major variation of it named for him.


Gene Technique Could Shape Future Generations
For the first time, a scientist has developed a technique that can allow the alteration of genes in sperm, passing the changes to the animal's progeny.
It is a development, ethicists say, that brings the brave new world of gene manipulation hurtling closer and raises troubling questions about what science has wrought and how society should deal with new technologies that have enormous potential for relieving human suffering but also have enormous potential for misuse.


Does Ordinary Baker's Yeast Hold Secret to Curing Common Cold?
ORDINARY baker's yeast may harbor a cure for the common cold, according to a scientist who says he made the discovery by accident.
Hidden in the genetic machinery of yeast is a newly discovered molecule that prevents cold viruses from replicating inside human cells, said Dr.
Asim Dasgupta, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of California in Los Angeles.
When this molecule is diffused into human cells -- so far this has been done only in a laboratory dish -- the virus is stopped dead in its tracks; it can no longer spread to other cells, he said.

With two consecutive losses, and an important game Sunday against the Jets, the Miami Dolphins appear to be doing a fade hauntingly similar to the five-game losing streak that ended last season.

The quarterback is just not getting Marino-like results.
The passing yardage is still there, as Miami's No. 1 ranking in National Football League offense attests.
But the touchdowns have stopped flowing.

He and two companions died when the vehicle bounced off a curb, flew into the air, ricocheted off a tree at a height of 15 feet, spun around and hurtled another 25 feet into a second tree.
Two other occupants of the vehicle were critically injured.

Mahler Goes on Trial: Genius or Fraud or Both?
It was partly in jest that on Sunday in Weill Recital Hall an English journalist named Norman Lebrecht accused America of manslaughter in the death of Gustav Mahler. ("I assume you will be calling in Professor Dershowitz for the defense," he said.) But in a startling, often gripping symposium that gathered some of the world's most important Mahler scholars at Carnegie Hall over the weekend, the image of a trial did not seem completely out of place.
Speaker after speaker found villains and victims in what seemed, at first glance, to be a rather sober academic topic: "Mahler in America, 1907-1911."
Like one of those ersatz folk melodies in a Mahler symphony that soon grow into a heaven-storming exclamation, there was a lot going on in the period defined in that title.
Those were the years, after all, in which Mahler composed his late, death-haunted masterpieces: "Das Lied von der Erde," the Ninth Symphony and the unfinished 10th.
In 1907, he was at the peak of his career, but was stunned by the death of his young daughter, the diagnosis that he had an often fatal heart condition and the continuing anti-Semitism in Vienna.


Region News Briefs; Prosecutor Says Officials Took Developer's Bribes
Three former Brookhaven officials accepted thousands of dollars in cash and deals on cars from a developer, John McNamara, in exchange for supporting his projects, a Federal prosecutor said today in opening arguments at the trial of the officials.
Mr.
McNamara is expected to be the chief prosecution witness against the three, Donald Zimmer, 60, and Anthony Losquadro, 54, former town board members, and Anthony Aliperti, 56, a former planning board member.


L. T. Provides the Inspiration Again
Thirteen mostly brilliant National Football League seasons weren't enough for Lawrence Taylor to forget the one that frustrated him the most.
That was in 1983, when the Giants labored through a 3-12-1 campaign in Bill Parcells's first year as head coach.
It was the memory of that dismal campaign that brought the Hall of Fame-bound linebacker to the Astrodome tonight in an attempt to scold the Giants out of a seven-game losing streak.
Taylor may have retired, but he still feels a part of the Giant family and this Giants team.
That's why he came to Houston this weekend and asked Dan Reeves if he could speak to the team before it took the field for tonight's game against the Oilers.


Browns Have Power, but Not Performance
Some Cleveland Browns sat at their lockers wearing a mean scowl, slowly cutting tape from their ankles.
Some sat staring aimlessly at the floor.
Others shuffled about the locker room, speaking to no one and making it clear that they were not to be spoken to.
You would have thought that the Browns had just lost the Super Bowl.


Pulling Punches; NATO Hits Serbs, But Not Too Hard
By military standards, the NATO attack carried out today against a Serbian-controlled air base in Croatia was the equivalent of a nasty note.
The air strike, trumpeted by NATO as the biggest in the alliance's brief combat history, involved 39 attack and reconnaissance planes from four nations.
The targets were hit.
There were no allied casualties.


Biochem Pharma
Shares of Biochem Pharma Inc., a Canadian drug company, established a new 52-week high of $13.625 in Nasdaq trading before closing at $12.75, up $1.125.
Over the weekend, Biochem announced promising, but still preliminary, results for an anti-AIDS treatment.


Well, Somebody Had to Win: Giants Snap Streak
Lawrence Taylor -- yes, that L. T. -- was on the Giants' sideline for tonight's monumental Monday night game with the Houston Oilers.
He cheered.
He high-fived.
He even did a little coaching.
There was, however, one thing he didn't do: block for quarterback Dave Brown.
Who knows, maybe if Giants Coach Dan Reeves turned to the greatest linebacker of all time and asked him to go into the game and block for Brown he could have done a better job than the linemen did.
That didn't happen, and a blown assignment led to Oiler linebacker Lamar Lathon getting a 10-yard head start before smacking Brown under the chin with his helmet, hitting him so hard Brown's helmet almost came off.


3 Planes Make Emergency Landings
Two commuter planes made emergency landings at Philadelphia International Airport today within 15 minutes of each other.

Sudan's Long Civil War Threatening to Spread
The battle front is almost invisible here, lost in an endless expanse of lush green elephant grass of the southern Sudan and marked only by the muddy meander of the Aswa River as it meets the White Nile.

Nasdaq Proposes Changes Aimed at Individual Investor
The National Association of Securities Dealers announced changes in its system yesterday that are expected to make it easier for individual investors to get better prices when they buy and sell Nasdaq stocks.
In some cases, the changes will make it easier for investors to trade directly with each other, rather than only with brokers, who are called market makers.


CLINTON IS OPEN TO RABIN'S PLEAS
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel went to the White House today and came away with firm commitments from President Clinton for most everything he sought: generous foreign aid, further military assistance and the prospect of American peacekeeping troops in the Golan Heights should Israel and Syria make peace.
But even Mr.
Clinton's firmest commitment is shakier these days, as Republicans assume control of the foreign aid purse strings in Congress.
And so the usual exchange of praise at today's session was followed by something new: a defense of the Middle East peace talks against a pointed attack by the prospective chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms of North Carolina.


Biologists Master the Treetops, The Real Scene of Forest Action
FROM the treetops of the Pacific Northwest to the heights of the steamy Sri Lankan jungle, biologists can be found heading upwards in record numbers into the forest canopies to mine the richness of this once remote habitat.
Previously restricted to intrepid climbers willing to risk life and limb, the frontier of the canopy has in the last decade opened to many who instead float through the upper reaches of the forest on dirigibles or take rides similar to ski lifts.
Others can now explore it easily from towers, platforms and giant cranes.
And with these new, somewhat less death-defying methods available, researchers say they have at last begun to paint a more scientifically rigorous picture of this world.

Bob Dole, Trade Bully
Senator Bob Dole, the next majority leader, is exploiting his new political power by withholding approval of a world trade agreement that has taken seven years to negotiate.
One reason, he says, is that the accord will threaten American sovereignty.
That at least sounds noble, though Mr.
Dole is wrong.
His other reason is narrow and crass.
As he told ABC on Sunday, he may block the trade accord unless the Administration swallows a cut in the tax on capital gains -- the profit from selling stocks, bonds and other investments.
Mr.
Dole's behavior mirrors what the electorate decisively rejected two weeks ago: politicians who say they stand for one set of principles but act according to another.
The Republican Party has proudly put the U.S. in the forefront of nations negotiating for open trade and investment.
Mr.
Dole supported past free-trade pacts because he recognized that they contributed mightily to world growth.
The new accord would give the U.S. economy alone a boost of between $70 billion and $200 billion a year.

Gingrich, who is expected to become Speaker of the House in January, said at an airport news conference here.


NATO Pushes Back on Bosnia
Serbian forces may now take NATO enforcement of United Nations resolutions on Bosnia a bit more seriously.
In contrast to the pinprick air strikes of recent months, waves of NATO aircraft bombed an airfield yesterday in Udbina, Croatia, that the Serbs were using to launch attacks against the besieged Bosnian city of Bihac.
Still, the Udbina mission was intentionally limited to cratering the airfield, leaving Serbian planes and fuel dumps intact.
NATO also avoided targeting the Serbs' artillery, which poses a more immediate threat to Bihac.

Top International Trade Official Urges U.S. to Approve Accord
Failure by the United States Senate to ratify the proposed new global trade agreement, the world's top trade official said yesterday, would destroy the existing world trading order, return international commerce to "the law of the jungle" and deprive the world of an estimated $500 billion in economic gains by the year 2005.
Addressing a press conference at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, the official, Peter Sutherland, who heads the Geneva organization that regulates international commerce, said it was inconceivable to him that the Senate could reject an accord that has been supported by both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Each at-bat is treated like a scientific experience.

Ancient Weights in The Andes
IN 1921, the anthropologist Erland Nordenskiold proposed that the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Andes had their own system of standard weights.
He hypothesized that they were measured in multiples of a basic unit that he called "H," for huarcu, the word for weight in two Andean languages.
He cited nine pebbles in a cloth bag and four additional weights from Andean sites, all of which, he said, conformed to the system.
His proposal was generally dismissed.

Novel Kind Of Computing: Calculation With DNA
IN a bold experiment that is provoking investigators to reconsider what a computer is and what it means to compute, a researcher has used DNA, the genetic material, as a sort of personal computer.
Exploiting the extraordinary efficiency and speed of biological reactions, he translated a difficult mathematical problem into the language of molecular biology and solved it by carrying out a reaction in one-fiftieth of a teaspoon of solution in a test tube.
Conventional computers perform operations on logical symbols, which are represented inside the machine by the flow of electrons.
Dr.
Adleman's idea is to set up a system of symbols whose tangible expression is not electrons but the chemical units of DNA.
The idea is not so far fetched given that DNA is a rich repository of information and that living cells are processing the information all the time.
In Dr.
Adleman's test tube system, he sets up a problem by synthesizing particular molecules of DNA, and he processes the information through the chemical reactions that take place when the molecules are mixed together.


Battle Goes On as Rent Control Is Defeated in Massachusetts
Landlords here have complained for years that this city's rent-control laws are ruinous.
But when they tried to change the system at the local level, they were always outnumbered by the tenants.
So this year, even though only two other communities in Massachusetts have rent control -- Boston and Brookline -- the landlords decided to challenge the system at the state level.
They introduced a ballot question asking voters across the state whether rent control should be prohibited.
On Election Day, they won narrowly, 51 percent to 49 percent.

Some Aristide Supporters Seek Abolition of Military
Friday was Armed Forces Day in Haiti, a national holiday usually marked with great pomp and display.
But in recognition of the new political realities here, the elite army honor guard that paraded before President Jean-Bertrand Aristide marched without weapons.
And to a growing number of Haitians, it appears that merely humbling and disarming the military, which has ruled for all but a few months of the last decade, is not enough.
A campaign to abolish the armed forces is quickly gaining support among a populace weary of the corruption and brutality associated with the military.

The theme of the new work, given on Friday at Performance Space 122, appears openly stated.
"Behind every successful woman, there is a woman -- often herself," Ms.
Pivar says early in the piece.
But the modest typist of the title is Toklas, who reportedly typed and edited Stein's writings.

Superintendents Get the 'Depressing' News
At 7:30 yesterday morning, Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines gathered nearly 40 school superintendents from every part of New York City to tell them the bad news: the city's proposed cuts of $190 million from the schools budget would be felt in the classroom, even though Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had promised that they would not.
The meeting was the first step in a day that the Chancellor spent lobbying for the restoration of $30 million in cuts.
By the end of the school day, the word had spread to schools around the city that classrooms would suffer if the city did not find the money.

Business is booming all across the major industrial centers of the Midwest.
In a region that only a decade ago was dubbed the Rust Belt, companies are running at top speed, hiring temporary workers, demanding overtime of employees and straining to meet deliveries.
These are some of the signs that worry the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates last week for the sixth time this year out of fear that a fast-paced economy points to a re-emergence of rising wages and prices.
But amid this outbreak of inflation's symptoms in the nation's heartland is a curious phenomenon: so far, there is no disease.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; An oil company tries to enliven one of the basic purchases -- gasoline -- with a light touch.
IT has been decades since the enthusiastic uniformed Men from Texaco sang their way through hard-charging sales pitches and Esso insistently promised it would "put a tiger in your tank." Today's gasoline advertising tries selling in a far softer, more low-key manner, as demonstrated by a humorous, at times even winsome, campaign for the Sun Company.
Broadcast commercials and print advertisements by Angotti, Thomas, Hedge in New York focus on products like Sunoco gasoline and a new "co-branded" credit card linking Sunoco and Mastercard.
The campaign for Sun, which spends $13 million to $14 million annually on promoting its Sunoco brand and service stations in the East and Midwest, is intended to put gasoline in its proper place, so to speak.

American Express Unit Settles Laudering Case
A banking arm of the American Express Company settled for $32 million today a Federal money-laundering case that involved Mexico's largest drug cartel, also a principal conduit for Colombian cocaine entering the United States.
Prosecutors said it was the largest civil penalty ever assessed against an American financial institution for laundering money.
The American Express Bank International was accused of laundering drug money through Cayman Islands accounts for the Juan Garcia Abrego gang, also known as the Gulf cartel.
Two bank directors were convicted in June.
In a prepared statement, the company admitted no wrongdoing but said that it had legal responsibility for its employees' actions, and agreed to forfeit $25 million in laundered money, pay a $7 million penalty and spend $3 million to improve a compliance program that a prosecutor said existed only on paper.


Roman Catholic Bishop Denounces Repression in East Timor
About 135 Timorese protesters against Indonesian rule were arrested last week, and many of them were taken from their homes and beaten by security forces, the religious leader of East Timor said today.
"The military soldiers entered the houses and arrested young people without any kind of explanation," Bishop Carlos Felipe Ximenes Belo said in an interview.
All of those arrested were beaten, and two or three were hospitalized, he said.
Twenty-two were still being held, he said.
The police have acknowledged 80 or so arrests.


Pair of Baseball Meetings Set
Major league club owners plan to meet in Chicago Dec. 5 to discuss their strategy for declaring an impasse in negotiations and unilaterally implementing a salary cap, but their plans could be short-circuited by the union, whose executive board meets that same week in Atlanta.
The owners ideally would like to have a new system in place before the Dec. 7 deadline for clubs to offer salary arbitration to their players who have become free agents.
Their second choice would be to implement a new system before the Dec. 20 deadline for clubs to tender contracts to the unsigned players on their rosters.

Pataki Asks Cuomo's Help In Holding Down Spending
Showing increasing concern about the state's fiscal condition, Governor-elect George E. Pataki asked Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo today to freeze state hiring, delay signing new contracts and impose a moratorium on other major spending commitments until he takes office on Jan. 1.
Mr.
Pataki's request came on a day he said New York's deepening fiscal problems would make it "more difficult" to fulfill his campaign promise to cut taxes deeply without noticeably reducing government services.


Beijing Journal; It's Time, Again, to Talk of Cabbages, Not Kings
"How much do you charge for delivery?" a customer asked, leaning on the handlebars of his bicycle in front of a truck- sized heap of cabbage on the side of the street in western Beijing.

Reading an article on popular music the other day, I was halfway through before realizing I was asleep.
This was not the article's fault.
A primitive conviction that anything can be learned if you have the patience to read about it remains with me despite long experience to the contrary.
Another primitive impulse, however, has lately been sending me into dreamland whenever I delve into difficult subjects.
As a result, I now spend a lot of time sleeping in prose which I have entered in search of knowledge.


Overtime Is Money, but G.M. Assembly Workers Say They've Had Enough
If for many workers the American dream is drifting out of reach, the 4,800 General Motors workers here have nailed it down.
They own homes, cars, big-screen televisions, sometimes boats.
They have the assurance of secure pensions and good medical care.
Many of these men -- and most are men -- earn enough that they can comfortably support their families; their wives don't have to work.
But these workers, whether young and building families or older and planning for retirement, say they cannot enjoy what their labors have bought.
G.M., they say, asks them to put in extraordinary stretches of overtime.

Appellate Ruling Called a Threat to Endangered Species Act
IF the United States Supreme Court does not overturn a ruling from a Federal appeals panel, the Endangered Species Act might itself be threatened with de facto extinction, conservation groups, biologists and the Justice Department argue.
The department filed a petition with the Supreme Court this month asking it to reject a ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that the act does not prevent the destruction of the habitat of an endangered species, even if destroying the habitat means exterminating the animal.
The lower court ruling, called Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a Greater Oregon v.
Babbitt, shocked conservationists and made them run for legal ammunition to protect the teeth of an act that is considered one of the most effective pieces of environmental legislation ever passed.

Arctic Tribe's Hard Life Unchanged For Centuries
A NOMADIC tribe of reindeer herders who dress in skins, practice ritual sacrifice and have been using the same types of homemade tools and wooden sleds for more than 1,000 years may hold the key to a mystery that has long baffled archeologists.
The Nenets, who wander across the northernmost reaches of the Siberian Arctic, eat raw fish, drink reindeer blood and live year-round in reindeer-skin tepees called chums.
Last summer archeologists came upon a group of about 1,000 Nenet reindeer herders who have had almost no contact with Western culture.
Archeologists long eager to connect the ancient peoples of Scandinavia to the Eskimos of the New World thousands of miles away say that this group may help provide the essential missing clues.

Reliance Electric Agrees to Deal With Rockwell
After a month of resistance, the Reliance Electric Company agreed today to be acquired by its hostile suitor, the Rockwell International Corporation, rather than pursue a friendly merger with the General Signal Corporation.
Rockwell will pay $1.6 billion in cash, or $31 a share, to Reliance's shareholders in a deal that is sweeter than the $1.5 billion, or $30 a share, that the company offered in late October to break up a merger with General Signal.
To terminate that deal, Reliance will pay General Signal a fee of $50 million, as well as $5.2 million to cover expenses.


RESULTS PLUS
COLLEGE BASKETBALL Utah Upsets Indiana  Brandon Jessie scored 23 points last night and Utah withstood foul trouble to beat No. 11 Indiana, 77-72, in the opening round of the Maui Invitational in Lahaina, Hawaii.
The game, the season opener for both teams, was intense, and Utah's depth helped quite a bit.
Jessie, a junior college transfer, made both ends of a 1-and-1 with 19 seconds left for a 75-70 lead.
Indiana freshman Michael Hermon scored on a rebound with 10 seconds left to again make it a three-point game.
Sophomore Keith Van Horn, the Utes' leading scorer and rebounder last season who was saddled with foul trouble throughout, made both ends of a 1-and-1 with 9 seconds left.
A 3-pointer by Hermon bounced long off the rim and the Utah players jumped in a celebration circle near midcourt as a fan ran around the court with a school flag.
Utah will play No. 7 Maryland, which beat Chaminade, 95-67, in tonight's semifinals.

Saltzman is stepping off Fifth Avenue and into the regional mall, a move that surprised some designers.
Her previous stints in retailing were at Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and R. H. Macy &amp; Company, which owns I. Magnin, another exclusive specialty store chain with a big designer business that is being closed.

Ewing's Knee Holds Up; Knicks Win, Too
The Knicks had Patrick Ewing back in uniform last night.
Not on the bench.
Not in a designer suit.
Not clapping like a cheerleader.
Luckily for Ewing and the Knicks, they had a lot more going for them than merely their sluggish center against the San Antonio Spurs because they needed every available weapon.
Ewing and his sore right knee returned to the lineup after a one-game respite and the Knicks were thrilled because the dazzling David Robinson was at Madison Square Garden.
Even though Ewing was instrumental, he was not fully responsible for the Knicks beating the Spurs, 92-88.

Snippets From a Decade When Confidence Ruled America
The compactor school of television programming is operating at full throttle in "The Fun and Feel of the 50's," a two-part Disney Channel presentation that begins tonight and concludes next Tuesday.
The production, compiled for Reader's Digest Home Entertainment, skitters over the history and culture of an entire decade with material retrieved largely from what it calls the "indelible record" of an emerging medium called television.
While the memory of Proust's Marcel was exquisitely unlocked by the taste of a single madeleine dipped in lime tea, this documentary whisks viewers back to the past for a bombardment of images that generally end up little more substantial than cupcake crumbs.
With just about no narration, the assorted clips from private collections and archival vaults are allowed to stand on their own and, as is television's wont, everything winds up on a level playing field.
Ed Sullivan equals Korea equals Lucy's baby equals Sputnik equals Miss Clairol hair coloring. ("Does she or doesn't she?")

Rolling Stones Live on Internet: Both a Big Deal and a Little Deal
What was the first rock band in cyberspace?
In a well-publicized gambit to promote their pay-per-view broadcast on Showtime this Friday, the Rolling Stones broadcast 20 minutes of live audio and video from a performance at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas on Friday last week on the Internet, becoming the first major rock band to do so on that network of millions of computers.
But their moment in the limelight was tarnished by a little-known band called Severe Tire Damage.
Knowing that the channel carrying the Stones was open to anyone, and wanting to take advantage of the worldwide audience the Stones would attract, the group broadcast an impromptu performance from the Xerox PARC offices in Palo Alto, Calif., directly before and after the Stones concert.

Squired by the Mayor, she toured possible sites for a Frank Sinatra music library and museum and said prospects looked promising.

But until Sunday -- when a fully extended ladder buckled and then careened six stories to the ground, killing one person and seriously injuring four others -- no aerial ladder had ever collapsed in New York, city fire and union officials said.
Those facts contributed to the befuddlement of fire officials yesterday as they began investigating what caused the ladder's deadly failure at a fire in an apartment building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, on Sunday afternoon.

Among those arrested was Mui Bon Shek, described as a 52-year-old businessman and high-ranking member of the gang, who prosecutors said was audacious enough to set up and operate an illegal gambling business inside the state's Offtrack Betting Corporation office in Chinatown.

Seeing the Future, Darkly
"I am Michel de Nostradame," the French actor Tcheky Karyo says in English, his impassive face and monotone suggesting he might be an android.
But no.
"I am a scientist," he says.
"Nostradamus" is an overstuffed historical soap opera about the 16th-century doctor, astrologer, prophet and all-around great guy.
Its silly, anachronistic dialogue must have been hard to take seriously, which may account for the entire cast's poker faces.
Fighting the plague, Nostradamus gently puts little tablets made from rose petals under his patients' tongues.
Though he has alarming visions (World War I is much on his mind, shown in sepia-toned scenes of German soldiers and tanks), his prophecies are less important at first than his persecution by the Inquisition.
And, of course, there are his hot romances.
You knew Nostradamus made prophecies -- interpreted as foretelling everything from the French Revolution to Armageddon -- but did you know he was irresistible to women?


A Separate Pathway Slowly Carries a Caress To the Brain's Attention

So Witty, So Sophisticated, So Lonely
Famed for their stinging wit and conversational savagery, the wags of the Algonquin Round Table would undoubtedly have had claws out for a drama like "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle," Alan Rudolph's name-dropping celebration of their heyday.
Surely Dorothy Parker herself, a caustic critic who lacerated even "The House at Pooh Corner," could have had a field day with this film's pretensions, omissions and overweening literary lights.
But that would miss the fascination of a film with a charismatic, unforgettable heroine, stunningly well-played by Jennifer Jason Leigh.
"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" has its flaws, but it also has a heartfelt grasp of what set Dorothy Parker apart from her fellow revelers and makes her so emblematic a figure even today.
The film lives up to Mr.
Rudolph's observation (cited in production notes) that "the 20's seemed to me the source of many contemporary notions, only with better language."

A Lawyer Who Spoke Up
The privilege against compelled self-incrimination, said the dean of Harvard Law School, is "one of the great landmarks in man's long struggle to make himself civilized." Forty years ago, when Erwin Griswold spoke out in that manner, not many were willing to defend the Bill of Rights against Senator Joseph McCarthy, who railed against what he called "Fifth-Amendment Communists" -- traitors, he charged, hiding behind their rights.
That defense of liberty, by a lifelong Republican whose patriotism not even Mr.
McCarthy dared challenge, was one of the brightest achievements of Mr.
Griswold, who died last week at the age of 90.
There were other peaks and, in an extraordinarily long career, a number of valleys.


When Does a Sting Become Entrapment?
So, what do Marion Barry, Harrison A. Williams Jr. and John Z. DeLorean have in common?
Right!
All were caught by hidden cameras in the throes of apparent illegality.
Tonight's edition of "American Justice" brings back those embarrassing yet entertaining tapes in the course of a report on sting operations by the law.
The question is, at what point does a set-up become entrapment?
Or, where is the line between making an illegal act available or luring someone into it?
Let's go to the videotape.
Mr.
Barry, then -- and soon to be again -- the Mayor of Washington, made national television when he was shown taking a toot of crack cocaine, offered by a female friend who was doubling as a police plant.
Mr.
Williams, then a United States Senator from New Jersey, was among a pride of legislators caught by the camera accepting cash from a supposed Saudi Arabian sheik for some immigration favors, the famous Abscam sting.
Mr.
DeLorean, then a flamboyant automobile maker, showed up as a performer in a drug deal arranged by the Drug Enforcement Agency.
And in another, less celebrated but wackier case recalled tonight, a Federal agent played a gorilla to ensnare Mexican officials trying to smuggle him or it out of the United States.

What Women Can Teach Men
By now, the benefits of single-sex education for girls and women have been reported so often and so fully that you might think the advocates of women's institutions could snap their briefcases shut and declare the case closed.
But we can't.
It isn't enough to cite the familiar statistics showing that graduates of women's colleges succeed in traditionally male fields -- business, government, academia -- far out of proportion to their numbers in the population.
Unless we understand the reasons for the success of single-sex education for girls and women, we risk missing some important lessons about education, society and the sexes today.


Film in Review; The Many Lives of a Man, All of Them Odd
Maurizio Nichetti, the director and star of the mildly funny and excruciatingly whimsical "Stefano Quantestorie," should not be confused with Nanni Moretti, the director and star of the current "Caro Diario," a far more sophisticated and droll film.
Both have been compared, wrongheadedly, to Woody Allen, but a taste for one does not translate to the other.
Mr.
Nichetti, whose "Stefano Quantestorie" opens today at Film Forum, once studied as a mime.
He has a tendency to cast himself in the role of a mournful clown, and to load his films with multiple, overlapping stories that sound cleverer than they are.


California Tells Insurers to Pay $1.25 Billion
California's Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi, followed up today on a promise to go after car insurers, ordering 28 of them to pay premium rollbacks totaling $1.25 billion.
The move follows a unanimous decision in August by the California Supreme Court that authorized the full institution of Proposition 103, the 1988 voter initiative that required insurance rate changes to be approved by the commissioner and gave him broad powers to control prices and profits for insurers doing business in the state.
It also follows a payment in 1991 of $799.7 million in rollbacks to more than seven million California car policyholders.


Expedition to Houston Leaves a Good Taste in Reeves's Mouth
It was about 1 A.M. and the Giants, fresh off a 13-10 victory over the Houston Oilers on Monday night, were stuck in traffic en route to the airport and the flight home.
A car fire was raging up ahead.
The Giants were sitting on the bus.
But Dan Reeves couldn't wait.
He was too hungry.
So he and three of his assistant coaches, upon seeing a McDonald's about a mile up the highway, decided to hoof it.
How hungry were they?
Reeves, in a coat and tie, decided to climb a highway overpass, the golden arches looming.
A homeless man was so shocked at the sight that he told Reeves he had never seen anyone dressed in a tie in his neck of the woods.
Reeves and crew finally found salvation in the form of 10 burgers.

Bryan Ferry in Concert: Old Times Remembered
"Though your world is changing," Bryan Ferry vowed from the stage of the Beacon Theater on Monday night, "I will be the same." In the song, he's a steadfast lover, but he could also have been describing his first New York concert since 1988.
Now, as then, he performed in a ceremonial haze of frankincense, which was burning in a large urn on stage.
And as in 1988, he played the careworn, genteel, pensive lover, his hair falling over his eyes, his voice progressing from humble croon to troubled bleat.
Every so often, he'd reveal his younger self: the arch, brittle voice of Roxy Music in the early 1970's, ricocheting between consumer cravings and romantic desire in songs like "Virginia Plain" and "In Every Dream Home a Heartache." But Mr.
Ferry gradually subdued the irony in his love songs, and ever since Roxy Music released "Avalon" in 1982, he has been working variations on its elegantly restrained yearning.
Between pulsating bass lines and rippling guitars, he sings the role of someone who is lost in love, swept away by a passion that promises exaltation or immolation.
He has just released "Mamouna," (Virgin), his first album of new songs in seven years, further refining one of rock's most specialized styles.


Down in the Street, a President Was Killed


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Mexican Attitudes Shift In Flood of U.S. Goods
The Marlboro Man rode off American television years ago, but in Mexico he is still galloping hard, part of a stampede for products from across the border that is changing and challenging Mexico's modest advertising industry.
The elimination of tariffs by the North American Free Trade Agreement has brought hundreds of American products, from Kellogg's Pop-Tarts to the new Ford Mystique, to join standbys like Marlboro cigarettes on Mexican shelves and in showrooms.

Mayor and Council Break Off Negotiations on Budget Cuts
The City Council broke off negotiations yesterday with the Giuliani administration over how to cut spending to close a $1.1 billion gap in New York City's budget, and each side said it would proceed without the other.
The Council said it would pass its own budget plan, but Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said that he had already begun carrying out some of the cuts he proposed last month and would freeze any new spending the Council tried to send him.

Council and Giuliani At War Over Budget
Bucking some of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposals to trim city spending to close a $1.1 billion budget gap, City Council leaders broke off talks with the Mayor yesterday and pledged to draft their own budget.
The impasse sets up the most serious fight yet over what powers the Council has under the new City Charter, which gave that body expanded responsibilities.

Clemente's Widow Keeps His Dreams Alive
The number 21 signifies a lot on the island of Puerto Rico.
It is the number engraved on earrings, emblazoned on T-shirts worn by young men and women, the number sewn on the jerseys of Puerto Rican-born ballplayers such as Ruben Sierra.


Rebelling for the Sake of Rebelling
In "The Wild One," one of the classic portrayals of youthful malcontent, Marlon Brando is asked what he is rebelling against, to which he coolly replies, "What have you got?" If Mr.
Brando's interlocutor had held up a mirror, that would be the current state of punk rock.
At two sold-out concerts on Saturday night, Bad Religion at Roseland and NOFX at CBGB, punk rock not only reacted against its traditional enemies -- society and mainstream rock -- but also against itself.
Now that records by California punk bands like Green Day and the Offspring have broken into the top five on the pop charts, punk rock will have to come to terms with being what it hates most, at least until it slips back into the tightly knit underground scene where it has been thriving for years with few innovations.
This can take the form of parodying Green Day's hit song "Basket Case," as NOFX did, or discussing the ethics of "selling out" to major record labels, as Bad Religion did, or simply refusing to follow the convention of leaving the stage before performing an encore, as both groups did.

On Campus; Catholic Group Buys Toronto U. Site
A conservative Roman Catholic organization, Opus Dei, which some former members say uses cult-like practices to recruit college-age students, is opening a branch at the University of Toronto.
Officials of the group bought a 62-room residence last summer for $3.2 million and moved into the heart of the University of Toronto's downtown campus, said Opus Dei's spokesman, Fernando Mignone.
"There was a keen interest in reaching out to more university students," Mr.
Mignone said.


Book Notes
Get Busy, Nicholas Evans
It's hard to work up much sympathy for Nicholas Evans, the British screenwriter and producer whose forthcoming book, "The Horse Whisperer," has been the cause of so much excitement in the publishing and film worlds in the last couple of weeks.
After all, the book, being positioned as "Bridges of Madison County" with an equine flavor, has sold for breathtaking amounts: $3 million to Robert Redford and Disney, $3.15 million to Dell for publishing rights in the United States and Canada, and $537,000 to Bantam U.K.
In addition, publishers in Germany and Italy have each paid more than $500,000 for translation rights.
But the 44-year-old Mr.
Evans is under a great deal of pressure, and not only to see that the project earns back all the money already invested in it, a tricky proposition under any circumstances.
First, he has a more pressing problem: he has to finish writing the book.
The novel has been marketed and sold so far on the basis of what he has produced -- half a manuscript and an outline of the ending -- and the author has holed up in his home in South London with a commitment to finish the rest by the end of the year, so that the publishers can aim to get it in stores by next fall.


Cost-Cutters Reviewing Implants
On a recent trip to a New Jersey hospital, Kevin Weeks was appalled to witness an operation he considers a waste of money.
"I saw them putting a $3,000 hip that will last more than 20 years in a 100-year-old woman," said Mr.
Weeks, director of operating room programs for Premier Health Alliance of Westchester, Ill., a purchasing cooperative owned by 53 large hospitals around the country.
"They should have used a $300 unit that will last five years."


One Nation, One Vote? That's Not Fair
When Congress takes up the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next week, it should focus on diplomacy, not economics.
It should give particular scrutiny to the treaty's proposed offspring, the World Trade Organization, which could cause immeasurable damage to American diplomacy for years to come.
Contrary to the claims of Vice President Al Gore and other Administration spokesmen, the future of world trade does not depend on GATT.
Whether the treaty is ratified or not, world trade will continue to grow as it has for half a century.
Nor, despite the claims of right-wing isolationists and left-wing consumer advocates, is sovereignty -- ours or anyone else's -- at stake.
By definition, a treaty requires signers to forgo certain exercises of authority or "sovereignty."

Clinton Thanks Ukraine With $200 Million
President Clinton offered $200 million in additional economic aid to Ukraine today to thank that country's new President, Leonid Kuchma, for taking politically difficult steps sought by Washington toward free-market reforms and the elimination of nuclear weapons.
Promising a new relationship with Ukraine, which the Administration expects to become a major power in Europe in years to come, Mr.
Clinton also provided Mr.
Kuchma with security assurances in return for having persuaded his Parliament last week to vote to eliminate Ukraine's 1,800 nuclear warheads.

Like Boxer, Like Trainer
Riddick Bowe and Larry Donald are similar fighters with similar builds and similar styles.
That's true, up to a point.
But when Bowe, the former heavyweight champion, takes on Donald in a 12-round HBO fight at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., on Dec. 3, there's one similarity you can bet on: Both fighters will be getting the same kind of calm, studied critiques between rounds.
That's because Donald's trainer, Jancks Morton, learned his craft by studying Bowe's trainer, 83-year-old Eddie Futch.

As negotiations broke today for a two-day holiday recess -- and as some owners voiced concern over the effects of the prolonged lockout -- both sides acknowledged that the tax wasn't discussed during four intense meetings in the past six days.
The talks are scheduled to resume Friday with the site to be announced.

Personal Health; Making it work when opposites attract.
LAST summer one of my sons, the product of a Swedish-American father from a Lutheran Minnesota family and a mother of Russian-Jewish descent from New York, married a Filipino-born Presbyterian woman from California.
Next spring his twin brother will marry a Korean-born woman who grew up in a Methodist family in Ohio and New York.
But according to the findings of the newest and best survey of sexuality in America, my family's melting-pot mix of ethnic, religious and racial heritages is relatively rare.
Despite the fascination many claim to have with the exotic and the popular belief that opposites attract, this survey found that the overwhelming majority of Americans choose their sexual partners and their lifetime mates from a pool of people very much like themselves.


Suit Faults New York City Over Upstate Homeless Site
New York City was sued yesterday by Orange County officials who contend that a city-run homeless shelter in their county has become a dumping ground for criminals and the mentally ill.
In the suit, county officials are asking the city to conduct extensive checks on the criminal and psychological history of residents before sending them to Camp La Guardia, a shelter for about 700 men in Chester, about 55 miles northwest of Manhattan.


2 Bridge Titles Decided Amid Dispute
Two major team titles were decided Monday night at the American Contract Bridge League's Fall Nationals amid a controversy that prompted a brief strike by players.
This concerned Sunday's qualifying stage of the Women's Board-a-Match Teams, during which one player reported, correctly, having played the same deals four months ago in San Diego.
A committee of the national board of directors threw out the results of this session, a decision some criticized as based on narrow legalism.
And the committee announced that there would be no carryover score from the session that was not affected, thus canceling some scores that were indisputably valid.


Down Home In Maine
Beal Bean (Patrick McGaw), the stammering backwoods hunk who stomps through the film adaptation of Carolyn Chute's best-selling 1985 novel, "The Beans of Egypt, Maine," brings to mind a Cole Porter lyric from the late 1920's.
In "Find Me a Primitive Man," the hankered-after object is described as "someone with vigor and vim/I don't mean the kind that belongs to a club/But the kind that has a club that belongs to him."
As played by Mr.
McGaw, Beal is a Chippendale's vision of stubbly machismo and not the bearded bear of a man described in the novel.
The fantasy of mating with such a man is lived out by Earlene Pomerleau (Martha Plimpton), the film's plucky narrator.
If her life with Beal brings the excitement of Tarzan-and-Jane sex and a rugged outdoor life, its griefs far outweigh its pleasures.
Dependent on erratic, low wages earned in the timber industry, the couple live in desperate poverty that Beal is too proud to alleviate with the help of food stamps.
When Beal goes hunting, it is as likely to be for dinner as it is for sport.


Federal Judge Permits Entry of Haitian-Refugee Children

AT LUNCH WITH: William Shatner; Contemplating Death and the Sequel
HE'S alive. He's wearing a suit. And he's orange.
Captain Kirk is sitting in Orso, ready for lunch, still in full pancake makeup from a morning of television interviews touting his death in "Star Trek Generations." But the great thing about movies and the even greater thing about science fiction is that death means never having to miss a sequel.
Which comes as small comfort to at least one fan, my mother, who has spent the morning at a screening weeping over the brave leader's demise.
For almost 30 years she has had a crush on James Tiberius Kirk, captain of the Starship Enterprise, and now she is bereft.
I am not.
I have watched "Star Trek" under duress since I was a child, and today is no different.


Beauty Queen Is Convicted Of Reduced Charges in Attack
For months, the story of the beauty queen accused of attempted murder has fascinated the two Virginias.
It seemed, as one lawyer in the case put it, a case of "psycho Barbie doll gone bad."
But the tale that emerged here during a five-day trial that ended today was more sad than sordid: an articulate, striking woman who had never found a man who cared enough to put her photo in his wallet; a young man who could not settle for one lover at a time; a middle-class couple whose kitchen was invaded by a furious, wounded woman bent on revenge.

Would you buy a rug if you knew that it had been woven in India by 10-year-olds beaten if they didn't work fast enough?

Would you eat sardines if the cans had been filled by 12-year-old Filipino children sold into bonded servitude?
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT, is the most sweeping free-trade pact in history.
But like many agreements among different nations with different agendas, much has been lost in the translation.
One of the losses in the GATT negotiations was the right of children not to be exploited, overworked and underpaid as a source of cheap and compliant labor around the world.


By Dorothy Parker, From A to Z
THE POETRY AND SHORT STORIES OF DOROTHY PARKER  457 pages. Modern Library. $15.50.
Dorothy Parker always made good copy.
Cole Porter began "It Was Just One of Those Things," his tribute to one-night stands, with the lines "As Dorothy Parker once said to her boyfriend/Fare thee well,/As Columbus announced when he knew he was bounced,/It was swell, Isabelle, swell. . . ." She always made good copy and she still does, what with film tributes, articles and earnest panel discussions.
Ever mistrustful, she would probably greet such attention with the wary opening lines of her story "The Little Hours": "Now what's this? What's the object of all this darkness all over me? They haven't gone and buried me alive while my back was turned, have they?" What she would really want to know is, do they think I turned out good writing?


O.K. Corral Budget; Council, Pressed by Giuliani for Cuts In Midyear, Looks to Test Its Powers
When the new City Charter took effect four years ago, it vastly increased the authority of the City Council, but it also left the Mayor with unrivaled budget powers that most governors or even the President might envy.
But Rudolph W. Giuliani is the first Mayor to vow to use those powers to the hilt.
And so the Council, faced with a second round of enormous budget cuts and with pleading constituents, has now threatened to test the limits of its own budget authority -- a move that could end up pitting the Mayor and the Council against each other in court.

On TV, a Heightened Gay Presence
As a script in process, it could be titled "The Closet and the Conservative Ascendancy." Few developments over the last decade have been more startling than the growing visibility, proud and demanding, of gay men and lesbians.
But the recent election triumphs of the Republican right have re-energized crusades and catch phrases -- "family values" is one -- that have traditionally been used against homosexuals.
Will gay men and women be forced to step back, even if only part way, into the closet?
The question at the moment is this: Is the door half open or half closed?
The answer, at least as far as television entertainment is concerned, is that the door has never been open wider.
And it is likely to stay that way.
A few years ago, gay groups were complaining, justifiably, that they were tired of seeing homosexuality portrayed on television as a problem.
They wanted to see themselves integrated into ordinary situations.
They wanted to be depicted as being as demographically diverse as heterosexuals.
A survey of recent programs confirms considerable changes.


London Journal; A Tipsy Big Ben Leans Over Bedlam-on-Thames
Westminster Bridge is falling down, or would be if engineers had not just embarked on a project to shore it up.
Across town, near Sloane Square, one of the Victorian-era iron beams supporting the roof of the Underground station is cracked, forcing trains to crawl through at 15 miles an hour.
Even Big Ben isn't standing as tall as it used to.
Last month, engineers reported the 135-year-old clock tower was listing just over a tenth of an inch, a slight tilt that some experts believe is related to nearby tunneling for a rail line extension.


Pilot Offers Explanation For Odd Noise On USAir Jet
A USAir captain says he may have created an unusual noise on a Boeing 737 by accidentally turning on the public address system during a flight a few hours before the airplane crashed near Pittsburgh on Sept. 8, killing all 132 people aboard.
In court papers last week, lawyers for the widow of one of the victims said three people had reported an odd noise aboard the aircraft on its trip from Charlotte, N.C., to Chicago, immediately before its fateful flight to Pittsburgh.
The reports gave rise to speculation that the noise was related to the subsequent crash, which remains under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.

Film in Review; Macaulay Culkin Finding Himself in a World of Books
Unless Macaulay Culkin gets lost in some age-defying time warp, "The Pagemaster" has to be one of the last films in which this 14-year-old can play a cute little boy.
He still does it very well as a scaredy-cat named Richard, who is fearful of everything, including his own treehouse.
His father (Ed Begley Jr.) is worried by the way Richard can recite the statistical odds of being injured while playing baseball.
But Mr.
Culkin's charm can't take this children's movie far.
"The Pagemaster" is a pallid film framed at the start and finish by live action and mostly composed of cheap-looking animation.
The movie proclaims that reading is an adventure, and though books literally come alive (one even has Whoopi Goldberg's streetwise voice and personality) the adventure never takes off.


Recalling the Muppet Master
It all began in 1955 with a hand in a sock.
The hand belonged to Jim Henson, whose impertinent puppets on a show called "Sam and Friends" become a local late-night hit on the CBS affiliate in Washington.
From the beginning, Mr.
Henson's attitude toward television was, "Let's play with the medium." How imaginatively and memorably he played is recounted on "The World of Jim Henson," tonight's 90-minute "Great Performances" presentation on WNET.
Proceeding chronologically, the show includes interviews with longtime Henson colleagues like Frank Oz, performer and director, and Jerry Juhl, head writer, along with fans like Ted Koppel ("I think we all see a little bit of ourselves in Kermit and wish we only had Kermit's panache") and Maurice Sendak ("There was something so to the heart, you were astonished that it could be so simple and funny").

Mike Nichols, Kathy Bates, Zoe Caldwell and Karl Malden were among those who paid tribute to the actress before an audience that included Tandy's husband of 52 years, Hume Cronyn.
Sir John Gielgud and Sir Alec Guinness were heard on tape.
Sir John recalled their early performances together (Tandy was Ophelia to his Hamlet) and spoke about her "brilliant career" and her "enchanting personal character."

Film in Review; Military Coup in Australia
Few areas of the world have inspired more mystically shimmering cinematography than the Australian outback, the setting for "Resistance," a contemporary political thriller directed by Paul Elliot and Hugh Keays-Byrne.
That aura of magical translucence has been heightened by the film's director of photography, Sally Bongers, to evoke a vision of Australian rural life that is hallucinatory in its intensity and precision.
Ms.
Bongers was largely responsible for the surreal ambiance that gave Jane Campion's films "Sweetie" and "The Piano" their otherworldly quality.
And in "Resistance," which opens today at Angelika 57, she has outdone herself in creating beautiful but disturbing cinematic pictures that give the expression "the land down under" a more than geographic resonance.


Nutrition Guides May Be Deceptive for the Aged
IT should surprise no one to learn that people's bodies change in significant ways as they age.
But researchers are just beginning to discover important nutritional differences between the old and young that, if ignored, could adversely affect the health and well-being of older Americans.
In today's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, for example, Dr.
Susan B. Roberts and colleagues at the Federal Agriculture Department's Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging in Boston report that older men seem to have trouble balancing the amount of calories they consume with the amount they expend.
When forced to gain weight, they hang on to the extra pounds, and when their weight drops below normal, they do not readily gain it back.
Either way -- overweight or underweight -- this failure to adjust could increase the risk of serious illness in older people, Dr.
Roberts said.

Fingers nestled against the triggers of their M-16 automatic rifles as the soldiers watched Palestinians drive by on the main road a few yards away.


Dow Plunges 91.52 As High Rates Lure Investors to Bonds
In one of the most turbulent market sessions this year, stock prices fell further yesterday than on any other day in the last 10 months.
Almost all the 91.52-point, or 2.4 percent, selloff in the Dow Jones industrial average came in late afternoon trading and left traders puzzling about the reasons.
But many said the heavy sales were a result of the belief that investors, both large companies and average Americans, would now sell stocks to buy bonds because they were becoming a more attractive investment.

NEW JERSEY PLANS TO CUT PAYMENTS FOR MEDICAID 20%
New Jersey officials said today that they planned to cut the amount of money hospitals receive to care for Medicaid patients by 20 percent starting in March.
William Waldman, the State Human Services Commissioner, said he expected a court challenge, but is confident the move, which would reduce hospital reimbursements by $135 million annually, would be upheld.
"We cannot be in the business of subsidizing hospitals," Mr.
Waldman told reporters at a meeting in his office.
"We must become the purchasers of services that are delivered efficiently and economically."


Artists Suffer More From Mental Illness
To the Editor:
Daniel Grant, in criticizing my views on the link between artistic creativity and mood disorders ("On Not Doubting Sanity of Artists," letter, Nov. 18), seems not to know or understand the substantial research literature on the subject.
First, no one would claim that all artists suffer from mood disorders, and certainly not that all, or indeed many of them, are "insane." Second, there are studies that compare rates of mental illness in artistic and non-artistic groups.


Knicks Use Old In-Your-Face Tricks
Moments after the Knicks defeated the San Antonio Spurs Monday night at the Garden, Pat Riley praised their defense and intensity, and he basically said they were returning to being the old Knicks.
In a humid and happy locker room, his players echoed those sentiments.
Meet the new Knicks, same as the old Knicks.
After a brief flirtation with increased running was ditched because the Knicks became too reliant on jumpers and Riley became too incensed with watching opponents breeze up and down the court, New York is settling into a familiar routine.
The Knicks are adapting to the new hand-checking rules and trying to play in their old, rugged manner.
It is working.

M. T. Jenkins, 77, Doctor Who Tried To Revive Kennedy
Dr.
Marion Thomas Jenkins, the Texas anesthesiologist who tried to resuscitate both President John F. Kennedy and his assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, 31 years ago, died on Monday at his home in Dallas.
He was 77.
The cause was stomach cancer, his family said.

Comptroller Sees Waste In Busing Preschoolers
Every school day, thousands of handicapped 3- and 4-year-old children spend more than two hours a day on buses to get to and from special training programs in New York City that they may not need, the City Comptroller charged yesterday.
A child from Brooklyn might be bused to the Bronx to correct a stutter; one from Queens might be bused to Manhattan for emotional problems.
Citywide, more than 9,000 children attend programs run by a loose network of private centers specializing in treatment of very young disabled children, more than half with speech defects as their sole disability.
Only about 14 percent are wheelchair users.


Victory Helps Frieder Scratch 5-Year Itch
In the Bo Schembechler Bowl tonight, Bill Frieder defeated Steve Fisher.
But it was a grudge match for only one of them: Frieder.
He had once been Michigan's coach, only to have the team pulled out from under his feet by Schembechler five years ago, and this evening was his payback.
His Arizona State Sun Devils pressured Fisher's Michigan Wolverines into a turnover every two minutes, and won their Maui Invitation semifinal, 79-62.

Evelyn Anderson, believed to be the last surviving member of the troupe that danced with Josephine Baker in "La Revue Negre" in Paris in the 1920's, died on Oct. 29 at Misericordia Hospital in Philadelphia.
She was 87.
The cause was pneumonia, her family said.

Charles Baskerville, 98, Dies; Portrait Painter and Muralist
Charles Baskerville, a prominent portrait painter and muralist, died on Sunday in Manhattan.
He was 98.

Mr.
Baskerville collapsed in the street after lunching with friends, Mr.
Varner said.


Teacher Advising Education Chief Draws Lessons From Own History
Since Terry Dozier, late of Irmo High School in Columbia, S.C., arrived at the Education Department, meetings have not been the same.
She is the first classroom teacher to become a special adviser to a Secretary of Education, serving as what Secretary Richard W. Riley calls his "reality check" on teaching and bringing to the interminable rounds of department meetings a view from the schoolhouse.


Glimpsing Promise In the Human Voice As an Instrument In the Future of Jazz
In the early 1980's, when the rank and file of young jazz musicians started a pilgrimage to New York, one instrument was conspicuous by its absence: the voice.
In the last decade, one important singer has emerged, Cassandra Wilson, and a few others of less than historic ability are hanging around.
Jazz singing seems to have entered a long, deep winter.
Tonight's vocal competition at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts here, held in front of a sold-out audience by the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, was supposed to warm the climate for singers.
The institute, founded by the Monk family and Maria Fisher, a philanthropist who also started the Beethoven Society of America, has been holding jazz's equivalent of the Van Cliburn Competition for eight years.
It has become one of jazz's institutional powerhouses, a marketing machine that has virtually guaranteed careers for its winners, who include the saxophonist Joshua Redmon and the pianists Marcus Roberts, Jacky Terrasson and Joey DeFrancesco.
It provides a souk where the major labels have been able to do their shopping, a Wal-Mart for an industry notoriously short on scouting ability.


A Classical Music Guide
To the Editor:
When you refer to magazines dealing with classical music, as your Nov. 15 Arts pages did in discussing men's and women's musical preferences, you ought to take note of the American Record Guide.
The magazine, to which I am a contributor, has for nearly three years continued the traditions of the defunct Musical America with a section edited by that publication's former editor devoted to classical music articles and reviews of live performances.


4 at Police Center In Washington Die As Gunfire Erupts
Four people, including a District of Columbia police sergeant and two F.B.I. agents, were killed today in a wild eruption of gunfire inside the Police Headquarters building, the authorities said.
Two other people were reported to have been wounded.
The police said the incident began around 3:30 P.M. and lasted about an hour.
But by tonight many details of what had happened remained unknown.


Sir Ian Potter, 92, a Financier And Philanthropist in Australia
Sir Ian Potter, an Australian financier and philanthropist, died on Oct. 24 at his home in Melbourne, Australia.
He was 92.
Sir Ian, who was knighted in 1962, retired in 1967 from his stockbrokerage, where he had been the principal partner for 30 years after founding it in 1936 as Ian Potter &amp; Company.
Later it changed its name to Potter Partners, and it is now Potter Warburg Ltd.


BASEBALL: A Natural at Filling the Seats; Weak Bat Adds Skepticism to Jordan's Future in Majors
Michael Jordan swung at the first pitch and dumped a double next to the left-field line.
The fans at Scottsdale Stadium cheered lustily, but a group of more dispassionate observers reacted differently.
"That soft line drive was on an 81-mile-an-hour fastball that was right there," a major league scout said a couple of innings after Jordan's hit in a recent game.
"He just got out too early with a soft swing."


The Case for 'Privatizing' Park Wildlife
To the Editor:
"Flood of Rwanda Refugees Is Destroying Ecological Treasure" (Science Times, Nov. 15) omits a significant reason for the threat to wildlife in Zaire's Virunga National Park: It is a common property resource.


U.S., in a Secret Deal, Removes Bomb Fuel in Ex-Soviet Republic
The United States has secretly negotiated the delivery of a large cache of bomb-grade uranium from Kazakhstan to this country for safe storage, Clinton Administration officials said tonight.
The existence of the more than half a ton of highly enriched uranium had not been previously disclosed.
The material, enough to make dozens of bombs, has been a major worry for Administration officials since they learned of its existence.
Officials said the material has arrived in the United States by plane, and will be stored in the nuclear complex at Oak Ridge, Tenn.

Italy's Premier Named in Corruption Investigation
Italian magistrates told Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi today that he was being investigated on corruption charges because of bribes paid to tax inspectors by his business empire.
Already reeling from local elections in which his conservative Forza Italia party fared disastrously last weekend, Mr.
Berlusconi received word of the judicial move as he played host to an international conference in Naples on combating organized crime.


Jergens Chooses Suissa Miller
The Andrew Jergens Company has selected Suissa Miller Advertising in Santa Monica, Calif., to handle the creative part of its consumer brands account, with billings estimated at $30 million.
That assignment had been handled by Publicis/ Bloom in New York for the last two and a half years until that agency and Jergens parted company in June because of potential conflicts with a larger client of Publicis/Bloom's, Cosmair.


Gay Officials Gather to Share Ideas
Like many colleagues in state capitols and city halls around the nation, the officials who met here over the weekend are concerned about race relations, religious conservatism and re-election.
But what brought about 60 of them together is what sets them apart: they are openly gay, a small but growing presence in local government.
They gathered as they have each year since 1985.


A Bunch Of Bobcats Are Caught In a Cage
It was all the Ohio University basketball team could do to make it to New York.
But for a few moments yesterday, a portion of the traveling party was not sure how long it would take to get out.
Thirteen members of the Bobcats contingent in town for the Preseason National Invitation Tournament -- including Coach Larry Hunter, various assistants and a couple of players -- crowded into a freight elevator on the sixth floor of the New York Athletic Club.

Helms Takes New Swipe at Clinton, Then Calls It Mistake
Senator Jesse Helms, the likely next chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, created a new uproar today when he was quoted saying that President Clinton was so unpopular on military bases in North Carolina that he "better have a bodyguard" if he visits the state.
Mr.
Helms later called the comment "a mistake."
Asked about the Helms comments at a White House news conference today, President Clinton said, "I think the remarks were unwise and inappropriate."

"Our hope is to train generations of leaders who will go back to Asia and shape the direction of their countries' development," said Prof.
Daniel Okimoto, co-director of the Asia Pacific Research Center at Stanford, who is helping develop the program.

Prices Advance Sharply On Treasury Securities
Prices of Treasury securities surged yesterday, with investors coming out of the stock market to buy bonds because of their attractive returns, traders said.
Demand pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to a three-week low.


U.S. Limits Gains From Sale Of Mutual Savings Banks
Federal regulators adopted new rules today covering sales of mutual savings banks to other banks or investors as a final step in a 10-month crackdown on deals in which savings executives legally pocketed millions of dollars.
Under the regulations approved today, executives of mutual savings banks will no longer be allowed to award themselves free stock and options in the transactions or buy large chunks of stock in their institutions' initial public offerings.


Appeals Court Upholds Academy's Removal of Gay Midshipman
A Federal appeals court today upheld the Naval Academy's removal of a top-ranked midshipman who had acknowledged his homosexuality.
Lawyers for the former midshipman, Joseph C. Steffan, said later that they had not decided whether to appeal the 7-to-3 decision, issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Any further appeal, to the Supreme Court, would provide the Justices their first opportunity to consider the issue of homosexuals' service in the military.


Venturing Several Steps Past Flamenco's Traditions
The World Music Institute provided fascinating and informative essays on flamenco and its dance forms in the program for "Flamenco Gitano," presented by the institute on Friday night at the New School.
But scholarly notes were of as little use as a road map through a rain forest.
The music and dance was familiar enough, but here the accent was on exuberant improvisation by six skillful, go-for-broke performers, all Gypsies from Spain and nearly all related to one another.
Dressed in simple black suits and dresses and cheerfully sipping wine onstage, they created an atmosphere that was unselfconsciously intimate, chatting easily among themselves and with the audience.


Rabbi Given Prison Term In Kidnapping Of Teen-Ager
In a courtroom rife with rancorous passion, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi was sentenced yesterday to 4 to 12 years in prison for kidnapping a Jewish teen-ager who disappeared from his family for two years.
Rabbi Shlomo Helbrans, the leader of a small Hasidic sect, was given the prison term after he declared fervently that he was the victim of the kind of "blood libel" that had "cost the lives of millions," and after the youth's mother spoke with equal intensity about losing her son to "people who control his mind."


Film in Review; Black Action With Jokes
In the funniest moment of "A Low Down Dirty Shame," a lighthearted detective yarn written and directed by and starring Keenen Ivory Wayans, the star deflects the charge of three dripping-fanged Dobermans by slipping into a James Brown imitation.
From a supercool private eye, Mr.
Wayans abruptly transforms himself into a caricature of the godfather of soul, barking instructions to his backup singers on how to perform "Say It Loud, I'm Black and Proud." Caught up in the spirit, the canines halt their pursuit and begin rotating their heads in time with the beat.
For all its jokes, "A Low Down Dirty Shame" is not an out-and-out spoof of the blaxploitation genre like Mr.
Wayans's 1989 comedy hit, "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka." The film, which opens today, is a good-natured action film that doesn't take itself at all seriously.
Every few minutes the story stops in its tracks to deliver the same sort of broad situation comedy humor found on the star's hit television series, "In Living Color." The movie isn't afraid to offend.
One running gag involves an interracial gay couple who are presented as mincing, lisping buffoons.


City Council Supports Mayor On a Sex-Store Moratorium
City Council members yesterday agreed to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan for a one-year moratorium on opening or expanding any sex-oriented video store, theater or bar.
The move is the first step in sharply restricting adult-entertainment businesses, an effort that the Mayor has made part of his drive to improve the quality of life in New York.
During the moratorium, new zoning laws are to be written to generally banish sex-oriented shops to areas of the city zoned for industry.


In America; At Last, A Truce
The cold war has ended.
Governor-elect George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are going to sit down and talk.
The blood feud, provoked by Mayor Giuliani's decision to cross party lines and endorse Mario Cuomo for re-election, is being put aside -- at least for the time being.
Political egos being what they are, it took nearly a week to negotiate the cease-fire.
The word began to filter out early yesterday:

Food Notes
A Chocolate Hanukkah
Hanukkah begins at sundown on Sunday, and here's a treat for each of the holiday's eight nights -- and then some.
Perugina Classic chocolate bars are kosher and range from dark to milk to white chocolate.
They come in 16 varieties, including dark chocolate with hazelnuts, milk chocolate with cappuccino filling, milk chocolate with peanut truffle filling, and white chocolate with macadamia nuts.
The complete line is sold at the Perugina shop, 520 Madison Avenue (near 54th Street), for $1.85 a bar.
Fancy-food shops and candy counters around the country carry a selection of the flavors.
Nothing but Doughnuts
Mark Isreal, formerly the manager of Angelica Kitchen, in the East Village, has opened the Doughnut Plant, a tiny wholesale bakery on the Lower East Side.
There, he is putting his grandfather's doughnut recipe to good use.
"He had a bakery in Greensboro, and his doughnuts were the best," said Mr.
Isreal, a native of Greensboro, N.C.
For the last two months, Mr.
Isreal has been exhibiting familial flair for big old-fashioned glazed doughnuts that are not only delicious but also contain superior ingredients.

The downtown spotlight is now turned on this former gas station, and the place throbs with energy.
The owners, Eric Goode and Serge Becker, insist the place is about food (new American), not scene.


At Risk in Gaza
Last Friday's fatal clashes in Gaza dramatized the perils that threaten Israel's historic peace with Yasir Arafat's P.L.O.
Fourteen people were killed and more than 200 wounded after Palestinian police fired on street protesters, many of them sympathetic to the militant Islamic organization Hamas.
It is six months since the P.L.O. took over administration of Gaza and Jericho.
Expectations were overly high, international aid has been slow to arrive and Hamas has tried to undermine the P.L.O. at every turn.
But by now the Palestinian Authority should have been able to establish a measure of civil order and start to deliver the fruits of peace to a long-suffering population.
It has not done so, and Palestinians' patience is rapidly running out.

Jones Quits as Coach At Oklahoma State
PAT JONES resigned as Oklahoma State's football coach yesterday to let someone else guide a program still trying to recover from National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctions leveled five and a half years ago.
Jones won 62 games in his 11 years, more than any coach in school history.
But the Cowboys had six straight losing seasons and have gone without a victory in the Big Eight during three of the last four years.
Jones said victories and losses had far less to do with his decision than the need to upgrade facilities and improve financing in order to put the Cowboys on equal footing with other Big Eight schools.


Rodman Gets Support
The National Basketball Association players' union has filed a grievance on behalf of forward DENNIS RODMAN of the San Antonio Spurs.
The union says the Spurs had no right to dock Rodman about $105,000 for violating team rules.
Rodman, on paid leave since Nov. 12, was fined $15,000 for showing up late for an exhibition game Oct. 20.
However, league rules stipulate players who miss exhibition games are subject to no more than a $1,000 fine.


Similar, but Separate
RIDDICK BOWE and LARRY DONALD are similar fighters with similar builds and similar styles.
That's true, up to a point.
But when Bowe, the former heavyweight champion, takes on Donald in a 12-round HBO fight at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., on Dec. 3, there's one similarity you can bet on: Both fighters will be getting the same kind of calm, studied critiques between rounds.
That's because Donald's trainer, JANCKS MORTON, learned his craft by studying Bowe's trainer, 83-year-old EDDIE FUTCH.
Both trainers took part in a conference call yesterday, and part of the conversation turned on the similarities of the two fighters, both former Olympians who failed to win their weight classes.
The two fighters have identical measurements in reach (81 inches), neck (17 1/2 ), biceps (17) and expanded chests (50), but at 38 inches, Bowe's waist is 6 inches larger than Donald's (32).

Swiss Bank Holds Off Challenger, but Barely
By a tiny margin, Union Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest banking organization, won a shareholder vote today that will keep the $300 billion institution out of the hands of a Swiss financier who had threatened to change management and take control.
Martin Ebner, whose BK Vision investment fund is the largest shareholder of the bank, failed by just 66,000 votes, out of more than 31 million cast, to force the company to halt its plan of changing two classes of shares with different voting rights into one unified class of shares with equal voting rights.

If the investigator's commanding officer accepts the recommendation, which is likely, only one person involved in one of the military's worst self-inflicted losses will face court-martial.

Labor Secretary Urges Cuts For 'Corporate Welfare' Too
Firing back at conservatives who have vowed to trim welfare costs, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich today issued a broad but vague call to choke off as much as $200 billion in "corporate welfare" as a way of finding money for jobs programs.
But he stopped short of identifying any corporate tax break or subsidy as unreasonable or counterproductive.
And though he referred to a study by a Democratic research organization that identifies $111 billion in preferential programs for specific industries, the Labor Secretary said he was not endorsing that report or the suggestions in it.


New Approach Is Tried in Suit Over Homeless
Trying a new strategy to prevent New York City from letting homeless families sleep overnight in offices, a state judge yesterday appointed a mediator to oversee negotiations between the city and advocates for the homeless.
In issuing the order, Justice Helen E. Freedman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan said that for 11 years, the courts have been unable to force a resolution, even though a contempt order barring the city from keeping families overnight in offices was upheld in May by the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court.


More Than 30 Hurt In Highway Crash Of Bus and Truck
A bus carrying about 40 people from New York City to Atlantic City collided with a tow truck on the Garden State Parkway near Holmdel, N.J., yesterday, seriously injuring both drivers and leaving 38 bus passengers with minor injuries, officials said.
The accident occurred about 9:35 P.M. when the bus, which had picked up its passengers in Chinatown, struck the tow truck from behind as both vehicles were southbound just south of Exit 114, said Trooper Rick Valmon of the New Jersey State Police.


Chargers Keep Hearing Tune to 'Kansas City'
Wobbly wheels on the playoff express are slowing some of the division leaders, especially the San Diego Chargers.
The Chargers jumped to a 6-0 start and life looked rosy.
But the Chargers (8-3) have lost three of their last five games and are shaky.
Although San Diego has a one-game lead in the American Football Conference West, the Chiefs (7-4) are bearing down and the Raiders (6-5) are close behind.


SERBS PRESS DRIVE ON BOSNIAN TOWN, USING HELICOPTER
Undaunted by a NATO air raid Monday, rebel Serbs backed by tanks and a helicopter closed in on Bihac today, pounding Bosnian Government forces and leaving several villages burning and hundreds of refugees without shelter, United Nations officials said.
Despite the attack on the Serbian-held Udbina airfield in Croatia on Monday, Bosnian Serb forces fired at least one surface-to-air missile at two British Harrier jets that were on regular NATO patrol near Bosanska Krupa, the officials said.

Times Square Center Associates has awarded the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation in New York contracts to design, build, market and manage outdoor advertising where 42d Street intersects with Seventh Avenue and with Broadway.

The signs are part of the redevelopment plan for the Times Square neighborhood.


M.T.A. Board Votes Plan Calling for 10¦ Fare Rise
Brushing aside the objections of New York City officials, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved a long-range strategy yesterday that calls for a 10-cent fare increase next year to help pay for monthly passes with unlimited rides and free transfers between subways and buses.
But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's two representatives on the M.T.A. board said the plan was unrealistic because it did not take into account the city's decision to cut $113 million from its contribution to the M.T.A.

Pataki Says He'll Meet Giuliani, And Help Him in a Budget Fight
They still have not spoken, but Governor-elect George E. Pataki offered an olive branch today to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, saying he would meet with the Mayor one on one next week and that he would help the Mayor next year in Albany to block two bills that would hurt the city budget.
In a press release ostensibly about the potential evils of "unfunded mandates" and "pension supplementation," Mr.
Pataki effectively offered a cease-fire in one of the most visible political feuds the state and city have seen in decades.

Survivors of 2 Different Wars as Kindred Spirits
TAKA, a child who has every reason to be afraid of everything, seems to be afraid of nothing.
Laughing and dancing, he leaps into a stranger's lap and then pulls him by the hand through a tour of his home in Greenwich Village.
The stranger follows, noticing the scars from a machete wound on the side of the child's head, and marvels at the survival of innocence.
The little boy's scalp was seriously injured last summer when a chain reaction of slaughter and rampage surged through his native land, Rwanda.
No one knows exactly how it happened but the doctors who operated on him say the blow was intentional.
No one even knows his last name, or where and when he was born.
Whatever Taka may remember of his injuries he has kept to himself, but last Saturday he put down the toy cars he was playing with and, turning serious, asked in English,

Bucks Defeat Celtics  Todd Day scored 23 points and Vin Baker added 20 as the Milwaukee Bucks used a strong second half to cruise to a 116-94 victory over the Boston Celtics in Hartford last night.
Baker, playing at the Hartford Civic Center for the first time since he attended the University of Hartford, scored 14 points in the second half as the Bucks snapped Boston's three-game winning streak.
Glenn Robinson added 17 points and Eric Murdock, activated Monday after missing seven games with an eye injury, came off the bench to score 15.
Rick Fox, who missed the past two games with a hip injury, returned to the lineup and paced the Celtics with 16 points, all in the second half. (AP) Hawks 102, 76ers 99: Stacey Augmon scored 23 points, including a short jumper with 11 seconds to play, as Atlanta beat visiting Philadelphia to keep the 76ers winless on the road.

Philadelphia led by 98-97 after Willie Burton hit a layup for the last of his 22 points with 1 minute 40 seconds to play.

(AP) Hornets 102, Warriors 98: Hersey Hawkins scored 7 of his 18 points in a decisive fourth-quarter stretch, helping Charlotte hold off visiting Golden State.
The Warriors were trying to set a team record for consecutive road victories at the start of the season.
Charlotte tried to help by being whistled for four technical fouls, two in the fourth quarter for illegal defense and a third in that period on the bench.
Golden State literally gave away its shot at five straight road victories, committing 20 turnovers. (AP) Cavaliers 112, Timberwolves 79: Cleveland collected 37 points off turnovers, while giving visiting Minnesota its worst defeat of the season.

Mr. Helms Must Step Aside
Senator Jesse Helms is out of control, and the Republicans have to do something about it.
What Senator Bob Dole has on his hands is a mean-spirited, loose-lipped legislator who has moved from being an embarrassment to the G.O.P. to being a global liability for the nation.
The chair apparent of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who jolted the Joint Chiefs of Staff over the weekend when he challenged President Clinton's fitness to serve as Commander in Chief, told The Raleigh News and Observer Monday night that Mr.
Clinton "better have a bodyguard" if he visited military bases in North Carolina, Mr.
Helms's home state.

Blue Blazers vs. Blue Jeans; Jury in Murder Trial Weighs How Appearances May Deceive
At times, Edward L. Summers has appeared on the witness stand in a blue blazer with a handkerchief tucked elegantly into the breast pocket.
But at least twice during the trial, he has been asked to change into the hooded black sweatshirt, jeans and boots he wore last January when he was arrested and charged with carjacking a Jeep and murdering its owner, a Rockland County teen-ager.
In a way, the jury at his murder trial is being asked to decide which is the real Edward Summers.
Is he, as the defense says, an upstanding 23-year-old premedical student from an industrious Bronx family who was terrorized by a drug dealer named Dino into taking part in a crime from which he ultimately shrank back?


A Sex-Defying 'What If,' Taken to Full Term
Virtual comedy is often the province of Ivan Reitman ("Twins," "Kindergarten Cop," "Ghostbusters"), whose films can look a lot funnier than they actually are.
Big stars, attention-getting stories and bright, shiny backdrops create a comic imprint that has more to do with brand-name manufacturing than with a humorous directorial touch.
Last year's "Dave" was much more ingenious than that, at least before it took the second-hour sentimental turn that is another of Mr.
Reitman's trademarks.
But where "Dave" had the nimble Kevin Kline in a dual role, "Junior" has Arnold Schwarzenegger in a pink maternity dress.
"Junior," about a man who becomes pregnant, proceeds efficiently but never quite lives up to its own potential as a sight gag.


The Schools Chancellor's Future
Even as he struggles to weather the latest budget crisis, New York City's Schools Chancellor, Ramon Cortines, has the support of a solid majority of the Board of Education, enough to insure the renewal of his contract -- if he wants it.
But lingering differences between Mr.
Cortines and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani could result in his departure.
Neither Mr.
Giuliani nor Mr.
Cortines should allow that to happen.
Mr.
Cortines, who took office nearly 15 months ago, has moved quickly and professionally to put his stamp on the system.
His biggest challenge, and the main source of hostility with City Hall, has been coping with the impact of the city's budget gap.
Just this week Mr.
Cortines announced that he would find 800 more bureaucrats to let go by next June 30 to meet an additional $190 million cut imposed on the board by City Hall last month.
But he warned that the most recent cut could not be totally absorbed through administrative staff reductions, and that eliminating "two teachers per school" might be necessary.

Clinton Backs Off on School Prayer Proposal
One week after he seemed to open the door to a constitutional amendment to allow organized prayer in schools, President Clinton seemed to slam it shut today, saying his earlier remarks had been "over-read."
"I do not believe that we should have a constitutional amendment to carve out and legalize teacher- or student-led prayer in the classroom," Mr.
Clinton said at a news conference today.
"I think that that is inherently coercive in a nation with the amount of religious diversity we have in this country. I think that would be an error."


Two More Young Lovebirds On a Murderous Rampage
As one more gory road movie about gun-toting, media-mad white trash on the rampage, C. M. Talkington's "Love and a .45" has elements of parody.
There's enough of "Natural Born Killers" here to suggest that Mr.
Talkington has read the mind of Quentin Tarantino, or at least taken satirical notice of Mr.
Tarantino's early screenplay for that Oliver Stone film.
On the other hand, maybe murderous teen-age lovebirds yearning to be television stars are simply a staple of our culture these days.
And maybe some ideas are just plain parody-proof.
In any case, "Love and a .45" is too mean-spirited to be funny, and it winds up nastily derivative rather than clever.
Mr.
Talkington shows some visual talent and has assembled a head-bangingly effective soundtrack, but he's short on dramatic inspiration.
Sentimental young sweethearts who take Polaroids of their hostages and are spurred into marriage by the thrill of murder are definitely old news.

Slovak Folk Troupe in Its New York Debut

Film in Review; Kieslowski's Trilogy Finale: 'Red'
"Red" was shown as part of this year's New York Film Festival.
Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 4.
The film opens today at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, Broadway at 63d Street.
In the dense, archly mysterious films of Krzysztof Kieslowski, bold but ineffable patterns shape the characters' lives.
Coincidences, missed opportunities, overbearing visual clues and strange, haunting parallels: all of these contribute to a gradually emerging sense of destiny.
Stories develop like photographs in a darkroom.
They are sharply defined only in retrospect, when the process is complete.


BUSINESS DIGEST
Markets
Stocks plunged in tumultuous late afternoon trading, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 91.52 points, or 2.4 percent.
Although the steep selloff left many traders puzzling, others saw it as a result of a growing awareness that higher interest rates have made bonds a more attractive investment.  [ Page A1. ]


Abortion Foes Face Enemy At Doctor's Negligence Trial
When a physician who filled in for a murdered abortion-clinic doctor in Pensacola, Fla., came before an administrative court in New Jersey today on malpractice charges growing out of previous abortions, he saw two particularly unfriendly faces in the courtroom.
They belonged to Vicky and Mike Conroy, abortion opponents who had traveled 1,000 miles from Pensacola "to see justice served."


U.S. Proposes More Muscle To Aid Bosnia
The United States today proposed stiffer military action and expanded use of air power to protect the beleaguered area of Bihac in northwest Bosnia.
But Western European nations have yet to agree on whether to take further military action, leaving the fate of the American proposal unclear.


A Day in the Life of a City Potato
THE potato got to the "21" Club at 8:30 in the morning, after having been bounced around plenty in the back of a C &amp; S Wholesale truck.
It was a yellowish Yukon Gold variety, and it did not lack for companionship.
It arrived packed with 300 pounds of kinfolk.
"Lot of spuds," noted Phil English, the C &amp; S driver.
"Man, somebody is going to eat." He had acquired the potato at the Hunts Point market in the Bronx before dawn, and under the now-brightened skies he unloaded the sacks on West 52d Street and entrusted them to Charlie Mottola, who presides over the avalanche of purchasing and receiving for the "21" Club.
Each potato cost the restaurant roughly 17 cents.


Oil Markets Unruffled By OPEC Output Limits
Oil prices reflected little concern among traders today about a decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to freeze current production levels through 1995 in hopes of driving up oil prices.
North Sea Brent, a benchmark grade of crude oil, dropped by a penny, to $16.94 a barrel in London, after the announcement.  [ On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil contracts for January rose only 26 cents Tuesday to close at $17.82 a barrel. ]


CHRONICLE
A literary squabble between the widow and the ex-wife of Kenneth Tynan, the British drama critic, has heated up.

Pfizer Will Buy SmithKline Unit for $1.45 Billion
In the latest in a whirl of billion-dollar deals in the drug industry, Pfizer Inc. agreed yesterday to buy the animal health business of SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. of Britain for $1.45 billion in cash.
Under the agreement, New York-based Pfizer would become the world's largest maker of animal drugs, overtaking Merck &amp; Company.
The combined Pfizer and SmithKline lines had $1.2 billion in sales last year, about one-tenth of the $12 billion global market for animal drugs.


Carjacking Jury Visits the Field Where Teen-Agers Were Shot
The jury in the carjacking trial of Edward L. Summers took a bus trip to the brush-covered field where two Rockland teen-agers were shot last January, one fatally, and both the prosecution and defense argued that the visit shored up their cases.
The prosecution argues that on the day of the murder, Jan. 3, Mr.
Summers, a 23-year-old premedical student from the Bronx, took a stolen Jeep from the Nanuet Mall to the field along a route that closely resembled the one he frequently took from the mall to the house of his sister, Alfa.

Making a Film Out of the Horror of Mother Murder
It remains the most sensational murder case ever in New Zealand.
In 1954 two girls, Pauline Yvonne Parker, 16, and Juliet Marion Hulme, 15, were convicted of brutally killing Pauline's mother.
"What attracted me to this story," said Peter Jackson, the 33-year-old New Zealand-born director of "Heavenly Creatures," "was that it was complicated, about two people who are not evil, not psychopaths but totally out of their depth. Their emotions got out of control."

Grocer Shot to Death In Brooklyn Robbery
A 40-year-old Brooklyn grocer was shot to death and his cousin wounded yesterday in a holdup at a bodega in Brownsville, the police said.
A man in his 20's, armed with a silver handgun, entered the V &amp; G Grocery at 199 Howard Avenue, between Chauncey and Marion Streets, about 10 A.M. and demanded money, the police said.


When These Old Graduates Miss a Game, It's an Upset
This Thanksgiving morning, Burt Beagle will be preparing for his annual trip from his Pelham Parkway apartment in the Bronx to nearby Murdock Avenue, where Mount St.

Mr.
Beagle, 61, has been a fixture on the sidelines of Bronx high schools for more than 20 years, patrolling the field near the first-down markers, clipboard in hand.
By his estimate, he has kept the statistics of more than 800 games, averaging three or four schoolboy matchups each weekend.


Currents; Theater in a Nutshell
WANT to add to the value of your house?
Lou Lenzi, the design director for Thomson Consumer Electronics, says adding a home theater can have roughly the same effect as an improved kitchen or a second bath.
With this as a carrot, Thomson, the French parent of the RCA, Proscan and General Electric brands available in the United States, has begun selling built-in media-room equipment directly to architects and builders.
Thomson asked the architect Michael Graves to make the ever-larger television screen and all that accompanies it, including a VCR and laser-disk player, look homey.
He domesticated the system with folksy shutters and decorated the surrounding wall with an exaggerated wallpaper pattern.
A rusticated base suggests a stone podium.
His "Entertainment Wall," rendered below, may be produced in 1995.

U.S. Opposes Lifting Desegregation Controls
The Clinton Administration, taking a position in a school desegregation case for the first time, told the Supreme Court today that it planned to oppose the State of Missouri's request to have the Kansas City public schools declared successfully integrated and no longer in need of Federal court supervision.
Solicitor General Drew S. Days 3d asked the Justices for permission to argue on behalf of the black plaintiffs and the Kansas City School District, which have been allies against the state in a long-running case that goes back before the Supreme Court in January.
Since they brought the case 17 years ago, the black families and the school district have sought to hold the state legally and financially responsible for the educational deficits in a district that was segregated by law until 1954 and for many more years in fact.


Mayor Opens Investigation On Jails Chief
Eight months after appointing him, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has opened an investigation into some of the flamboyant executive actions of Commissioner of Correction Anthony J. Schembri amid growing calls from outside the administration for the Commissioner's resignation.
"Things happen when I'm around," Commissioner Schembri once remarked, reflecting the larkish and supremely self-confident management style that opponents say has contributed to his current problems.
The critics, including the Democrats who head the City Council's Public Safety Committee and the State Assembly's Correction Committee, have questioned the Commissioner's effectiveness in managing the teeming system against a backdrop of budget cuts and unrest in the jails.

Schleppers
Several things distinguish New Yorkers from the rest of America's city dwellers, among them the way they walk.
It is not so much that their pace is fast but that their dodges and feints (a dolly to the left of them, a dog walker with seven charges to the right) resemble broken-field running.
Another distinction is their inability to stand on a curb while waiting for the traffic to clear.
Instead they wait in the gutter.
Never mind if that gutter is streaming from a cloudburst.
Standing in it puts them a step ahead of the crowd.

Defying Mayor, Council Offers Budget Cuts
Defying Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the City Council voted yesterday to adopt its own menu of spending cuts to close a $1.1 billion gap in New York City's budget.
The Mayor bluntly dismissed the Council's move as illegal and suggested that he would move ahead with his own cuts anyway.
The Council's vote and the Mayor's refusal to accept it prompted the most significant confrontation yet over the budgetary powers of the Council under the new City Charter, which went into effect in 1990.
With lawyers for each side defending differing interpretations of the law, the dispute appeared headed to court, throwing the fate of the city's $31.6 billion budget into confusion.

Dissident G.O.P. Senators Bid To Topple Marino as Leader
Dissident members of the State Senate's Republican majority have mounted a campaign to unseat Ralph J. Marino as their leader, charging that he is quietly subverting the interests of Governor-elect George E. Pataki.
The challenge is being led by Senator Joseph L. Bruno of Brunswick, a longstanding rival to Mr.
Marino and a leading supporter of Mr.
Pataki in the Senate.
Though some Republican state officials said today that they thought Mr.
Bruno commanded a majority of votes among the Senate's 36 Republicans, others allied with Mr.
Marino expressed confidence that he did not.


Months of Delicate Talks In Kazakhstan Atom Deal
The deal that brought more than half a ton of bomb-grade uranium from Kazakhstan to the United States required months of delicate three-way negotiations and was made possible only after Washington got Russian approval, Clinton Administration officials said today.
Officials said the negotiations began when Kazakh officials approached the American Ambassador to Kazakhstan, William Courtney, in the summer of 1993 and vaguely suggested that they might want Washington to take weapons-grade nuclear material from a nuclear fuel fabrication plant off their hands -- for a price.

The options include having the drivers continue the race in spare cars or holding a run-off immediately after the race.

NATO Jets Hit Missiles as Serbs Gain in Bosnia
As rebel Serbs entered the outskirts of a Muslim enclave in northwest Bosnia, NATO warplanes bombed three Serb-controlled missile sites in the area today in two raids that took the Atlantic alliance a step further into the Bosnian war.
The NATO attacks, by more than 50 American, British, French and Dutch aircraft, came as Serbian forces pressed forward relentlessly in their offensive against the Bihac enclave, entering the United Nations-declared "safe area" that surrounds it.


Exotic Houseplants (Not an Oxymoron)
THE hot-pink flowers and golden leaves of a bougainvillea named Raspberry Ice are aglow in the low autumn sun that is streaming through the greenhouse panes.
"If you've got good sunlight, this is one of the easiest houseplants, yet it has a gracious, pendulous outline," said Rudy Nabel, leaning on an ancient wood counter.
Through spring and summer, gardeners in search of unusual perennials and distinctive shrubs make a beeline for Nabel's Nurseries Inc., in White Plains.
But with winter's approach, the houseplant business has picked up.
Thoughts have turned to indoor greening, preferably with something unusual.

For Giuliani, a Checklist; For Pataki, Opportunities
WHEN the big day finally comes next week, and the pending power of Albany finally meets the reigning regent of New York City, what will they say to each other?
The imagination roars.
Maybe they will exchange home phone numbers so they can reach each other before 9 A.M. and after 5 P.M.
Maybe they will thank each other: Governor-elect George E. Pataki could thank Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for boosting his chances, maybe even for electing him, by endorsing Gov.

And the Mayor could thank the Governor-elect for giving him even more acceptance with New York City Democrats than he already had.


Wit and Craftsmanship Give Windows the Royal Treatment
IF curtains are like dresses for windows, then finials and their attendant hardware -- brackets, rods and rings -- are window jewelry, grace notes that lend fabric and glass a dash of style, ornament and fun.

Bosnian Serbs Warn NATO Not to Impede Advance

Born in the Camps And Still Kicking
Viktor Ullmann's opera "Der Kaiser von Atlantis" can probably never be divorced from the circumstances of its creation, and perhaps it never should be.
The piece, which was presented in a semi-staged version at Merkin Concert Hall on Monday evening, was composed at the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1943.
An allegorical portrait of Hitler, the piece was banned when camp authorities saw a rehearsal in 1944.
Soon thereafter Ullmann, his librettist, Petr Kien, and the entire cast were sent to Auschwitz where most, including Ullmann died.
Everything about the work, from its subject to its quirky part-classical, part-cabaret instrumentation, was determined by Ullmann's presence in Theresienstadt.
Yet it must also be said that "Der Kaiser von Atlantis" is also a remarkable, affecting work in purely musical and dramatic terms.
Just under an hour long, it tells a complex story in a concise, direct way and in an omnivorous musical language that draws on both classical and popular styles.
At times it has the archness of Kurt Weill's German theater music.


Dutch Prince Is Robbed of $5,000 Watch
A Dutch prince who braved the New York City Marathon fell afoul of a thief in Times Square the next afternoon and was robbed of a $5,000 gold Rolex watch and about $100 in cash, the consul for press affairs of the Consulate General of the Netherlands said yesterday
The consul, Henry Kol, said 24-year-old Prince Bernhard, whose mother, Princess Margriet, is a sister of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, was walking in Times Square when someone pushed an object into his back and told him to hand over his watch and wallet.
Mr.
Kol could not specify the site or provide a description of the robber.


Lower Stocks Aren't a Worry for the Fed
The steep fall in stock prices this week is not expected to prompt any policy review at the Federal Reserve, where officials have been surprised at the stock market's resilience until now.
While the Fed did not set out last week to bring down the stock market when it raised short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, its officials have not worried about such a prospect.


Vietnamese Hint the U.S. Could Use Port Again
Fearing China, Vietnam has begun to signal an interest in inviting American naval forces back to Cam Ranh Bay, the large port installation built by the United States during the Vietnam War.
The United States Navy seems interested in returning.
Adm.
Richard C. Macke, the commander of American forces in the Pacific, said on his recent trip to Vietnam that Washington and Hanoi could begin talking about military cooperation after settling their final differences over accounting for missing American servicemen from the Vietnam War.

Late Season's Greetings From PC Shopping Plans
Everyone knows Santa can deliver his gifts in a twinkle, and overnight delivery services are only hours slower.
The real bottleneck in the holiday shopping season is the time it takes to go shopping.
Two new companies are trying to solve the problem, turning to a combination of computer-based on-line information services and interactive CD-ROM disks that can store dozens of product catalogues.


Mexico City Journal; Don Manuel's Dream Tower: A 50-Story Folly?
No one has shaped the skyline of this vast city more than Manuel Suarez, a famously eccentric entrepreneur who was supposedly a protege of Pancho Villa and whose errant dream -- a 50-story domino of a building -- has loomed over Mexico City for 30 years.
Loom is the only way to describe the physical and symbolic presence of Don Manuel's quixotic vision over the low-rise chaos of the city.
His goal was to replace an old city park with Latin America's tallest building, concrete proof of Mexico's maturity as a nation.
He envisioned athletes of the 1968 Mexico City Olympics lodging there during the Games, themselves intended to showcase Mexico's emergence into the modern world.

Police Commissioner Orders Officers to Wear Seat Belts
Alarmed by a rash of traffic accidents involving police cars, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said yesterday that he would require police officers to wear seat belts beginning Jan. 1.
"I see the use of the seat belt as every bit as important as the use of the bulletproof vest," Mr.
Bratton said.
"I lose a hell of a lot more cops in injuries to auto accidents and failure to use seat belts than I do in shooting incidents."

Stocks Ride Out a Bumpy Session
The stock market showed surprising resilience yesterday, surviving a tumultuous session in which stock prices swung up, then down 22 times.
But as traders grabbed shares at depressed prices, the market ended little changed, after plunging on Monday and Tuesday.
The nearly unchanged market eased some investor concerns that stocks are in for a long, hard decline.
After some analysts predicted a fall of 30 or more points, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down just 3.36 points, to 3,674.63, while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 0.15 point, to 449.93.
The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index dropped 4.51 points, to 736.70.

250 Groups To Share In Grants For Arts
About 250 New York City arts organizations have qualified for matching grants from a $10 million fund set up by the state and city governments in July, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday.
The list includes big institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum, both of which plan to use the promised money -- a total of more than $800,000 each -- to open all of the galleries that have been closed on a rotating basis because of cutbacks in operating budgets.


High School Senior Held in Fatal Shooting of 15-Year-Old Girl
A senior at Mount Vernon High School fatally shot his 15-year-old girlfriend in his living room Tuesday night, then tried to bury her body in his backyard garden before his mother came home, the police said this afternoon.
The police said the senior, Leighton Smith, 17, shot Jennifer Sewell, a freshman at Mount Vernon High, with a sawed-off shotgun and then dragged her body to the edge of a garden in his backyard, where he buried her.
Although officials said they had not yet determined a motive, they said the students had argued before the shooting.


Presenting Opposite Approaches
The double bill on Tuesday night at the Knitting Factory demonstrated two approaches to post-modern jazz: witty and concise compositions from Joey Baron alongside unfettered, sprawling pieces from Roscoe Mitchell.
Mr.
Mitchell is one of the two saxophonists in the Art Ensemble of Chicago, which is performing through tonight at the new Knitting Factory (74 Leonard Street in TriBeCa).
In his early set, his music had more to do with gesture, timbre and stamina than with melody or swing.
His group, the Note Factory, is made for sonic density, with two drummers (Tani Tabbal and Vincent Lewis), two bassists (William Parker and Jaribu Shahid) and a pianist (Matthew Shipp) behind Mr.
Mitchell's saxophones and flute.
Partway through the set, it was joined by A. Spencer Barefield on guitar and Big Black on conga drum.


Communists Plan to Form Government in Nepal
Nepal's Communists appeared today to be on the brink of forming a new Government after winning more seats than the ruling Nepali Congress Party in last week's inconclusive general election.
But as the main Communist bloc met and formally named the man who led them in the election as their candidate for Prime Minister, last-minute maneuvering by Congress loyalists kept open the possibility of the formation of a centrist coalition to deny power to the Communists.


In Trade-Pact War, Clashes Outside Capital Are Heavy
Business lobbyists may be battling for the global trade agreement in Washington, but some of the heaviest combat has come where people produce things more tangible than legislation.
On Tuesday, in Agra, Kan., Dennis D. Hupe took a long enough break from feeding his sows soybean and corn meal to tell Senator Bob Dole's visiting aide why the Kansas Farm Bureau backs free trade.


Starving the Poor
The poor, particularly at election time, are routinely demonized for political gain.
Their exploitation in this way has brought us to a cruel place in the political landscape, a place where Americans -- conservative, moderate and liberal -- are finding it frighteningly easy to blame the poor for their own fate, even though that means condemning millions of children to poverty, hunger and hopelessness.
Given the savagery of the climate, it is useful to note what the Roman Catholic Church is saying in response.
The church, through its efforts to feed and house America's poor, is intimately familiar with the problem of poverty.
Of late, the church's most compelling voice has been that of the Archbishop of New York, John Cardinal O'Connor, who last month lashed out at politicians who caricature the poor for political benefit.
Cardinal O'Connor's observations last month in his column, published in the newspaper Catholic New York, merit extensive quotation:

Dreaming of a White Thanksgiving


Author of Nicole Simpson Biography Finds She's a Prisoner of Her Own Book
Faye D. Resnick sat on the couch of her country hideaway here, 3,000 miles from her home in Los Angeles and 40 miles southeast of the closest Starbucks.
Here, roadside vendors sell maple syrup rather than star maps.
Autumnal trees turn brilliant reds and yellows rather than a dull brown.
The log burning in the fireplace is genuine, not a California model lit by a switch.
Fearful for her safety, muzzled by protective prosecutors, Ms.
Resnick has been hiding here in silence ever since her book, "Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted," was published last month by Dove Books.
Prosecutors have accumulated corroborating testimony that, thus far, seems to have convinced them that she has told the truth.
Whether it will be enough to overcome her considerable liabilities as a witness remains to be determined, however, particularly since other less vulnerable witnesses may be available to paint the prosecution's picture of the Simpsons' tormented relationship.

Court Curbs Wall Street Journal in Fight on Whitewater Report
A panel of Federal appeals judges has denied The Wall Street Journal's request for access to the secret final report of the former Whitewater independent counsel, Robert B. Fiske Jr., and at the same time has barred the newspaper from disclosing the details of the decision.
The decision, and the order barring its publication, were handed down a few weeks ago but were not made known until late Tuesday, when The Journal filed a petition seeking relief from Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
The petition, parts of which were filed under seal, asks Justice Rehnquist to lift the order, asserting that it is an improper prior restraint on the paper's First Amendment rights.

Oakley's New Shoes Only Create More Pain
Charles Oakley's sneaker saga continued today as a specially designed shoe by Nike failed to alleviate the pain in his toe.
Oakley had waited almost a month for Nike to manufacture a shoe that was supposed to help take the pressure off the congenitally dislocated second toe on his right foot.
But, after a two-and-a-half-hour workout with the size 15 Nikes, Oakley said he experienced more pain in his toe than he had all season and would ask Nike to develop another version that is not as loose.


One Deal Hints at More to Come
Things will not always be so easy, but today's agreement between the White House and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas on the worldwide trade pact demonstrated that the Republican triumph in the midterm elections need not produce two years of gridlock in Washington, with Congress and President Clinton constantly at war.
It will certainly be difficult for Mr.
Clinton to govern, but it will not be impossible, as some shellshocked Democrats had first thought.


U.S. and Europe Adrift in Balkans
Despite the NATO air raids this week on Serbian missile sites in northwestern Bosnia and in Croatia, the United States and its European allies remain divided on the fundamental question of how to respond to the threat to European security from the fighting in the Balkans.
Today's raids, like Monday's strike on a Serbian military airfield in Croatia, were only a tentative answer to a tactical problem caused by the continuing Serbian assault on the Muslim enclave of Bihac, which has been declared by the United Nations to be a protected zone.


Army Says Nerve Gas Incinerator in Utah Is Safe
A team of Army engineers dispatched last month to review allegations that a nerve gas incinerator in Utah was unsafe found lapses in training and management, but concluded that none was serious enough to threaten the safety of workers or the public.

A separate study on the adequacy of the incinerator's design is be completed by Dec. 15.

Though he once enraged his audience at the Newport Folk Festival by playing electric, Mr.

Of course, it should be noted that not everyone in Mr.
Dylan's band was unplugged.
Brendan O'Brien played a Hammond organ and Bucky Baxter played a pedal-steel guitar.
The rest of the band was made up of other Dylan regulars on acoustic instruments: Winston Watson on drums, John Jackson on guitar and Tony Garnier on stand-up bass.

Russia's Nuclear Waste Gamble
For more than three decades, we now learn, Russia and the former Soviet Union have secretly pumped huge amounts of radioactive waste into the earth.
The goal was to sequester the lethal wastes far from possible contact with humans.
But already there are signs that some wastes are seeping beyond the original confines.
Nobody knows whether an environmental catastrophe is in the making -- or whether the Russians have found a waste disposal solution that, in their own context at least, is better than previously tried alternatives.
This is a vast environmental experiment whose consequences may not be known for decades or even centuries.

But the Council's leadership, which supports the proposal, appears to have enough votes to override a veto.


Currents; Inspiration From an Angel
PERHAPS as a grim example of wartime landmarks preservation, the colossal Kolner Dom, or Cologne Cathedral, which took 600 years to complete, was the only building untouched by Allied bombs.
Today, it is a pilgrimage site, both sacred and secular, and the architectural center of the city.
John Hutton, the design director of Donghia Furniture and Textiles in New York, vividly recalled his first visit to the Dom in 1991.
When he saw the cast-bronze handles on the 12-foot-high doors, he stopped in his tracks.
The handles, designed by Hugo Schneider in the late 19th century, depict an enigmatic angel with deep-set eyes, an enormous feathered wing and wind-blown hair (above right).
Mr.
Hutton found a napkin and pencil in his pocket and sketched three studies of the cherub on the spot.

But Ms.
Shange, the playwright and poet whose play "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf" was a hit of the 1976-77 Broadway season, has a new novel to talk about, so she puts all that aside and turns on her charm.

House Committee's Report Is Critical of F.B.I. in Ames Spy Case
A draft report by the House Intelligence Committee on the Aldrich Ames spy case criticizes the Federal Bureau of Investigation for taking a "wait-and-see attitude" on the executions in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980's of the bureau's best Soviet double agents, Government officials said today.
The report also suggests that officials of the Central Intelligence Agency may have been less than totally candid in their testimony to Congress about the deaths of the C.I.A.'s leading Soviet sources in the 1980's, they said.

About 5,000 Palestinians gathered in Jericho today to show their support for the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, whose authority has been seriously frayed by challenges from Islamic fundamentalists and the Israeli Government over the last few weeks.
Mr.
Arafat did not attend the rally.
He remained at his headquarters in Gaza -- largely because months after Israel and the Palestinians negotiated their agreement on autonomy, they have yet to agree on a practical way for him to move between the two self-rule areas, the Gaza Strip and Jericho, which are separated by Israel and the Israeli-occupied portion of the West Bank.

I hardly believed you could reach such a fabulous destination with an ordinary postage stamp.
In my mind, the "O" might as well have stood for Oz.
Lake Worth was a little Florida town near the ocean, where my grandparents' house stood, protected by mango, loquat, jasmine and shower of gold trees.
Growing up on the move, an army brat with 17 addresses over the years and none that mattered, I treasured my visits to South O Street.
It was where I could make my memories stand still.
There my grandfather and I built sugar cube Christmas cottages held together with frosting mortar.
There I squeezed "invisible ink" from lemons in the kitchen and ironed it visible again in the wash house out back.
There I hid for hours under the piano, playing with dolls and waiting patiently for the grown-ups to say something worth eavesdropping on.

Fatal Runway Collision Under U.S. Inquiry
Federal aviation officials were investigating yesterday why a twin-engine propeller plane taxied into the path of a Trans World Airlines jet taking off on Tuesday night from St.

Now, at least, tyrannies large and small, from China to Indonesia to Myanmar, can count on consistent treatment.
Until this month Myanmar, the former Burma, stood out as the principled exception to the Administration's complaisance.
While Asian and European countries cozied up to the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council, Washington refused to forget about the Slorc's record of trampling on elections, complicity with drug lords and continuing atrocities against civilians.

He had been under treatment for lung cancer, said Dick Arnold, a former law partner.

Many Turn Holiday Into Mini-Vacation
Spurred by bargain air fares and stable gasoline prices, a record number of Americans were expected to travel over Thanksgiving week, traditionally the busiest travel time of the year.
And although many people have long taken off the Friday after Thanksgiving, this year, travel experts say, more are viewing their long weekend as a time for both holiday visits with families and friends as well as a chance to sightsee, shop or ski.


Rudolf Firkusny Tribute
A memorial tribute to the pianist Rudolf Firkusny is to be held on Dec. 2 at 5 P.M. in the Paul Recital Hall of the Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza.
Among the scheduled speakers are Joseph W. Polisi, the president of Juilliard; Igor Firkusny, the pianist's son; the composer Philip Glass, and Kurt Masur, the music director of the New York Philharmonic.
The pianist Joseph Kalichstein, the Juilliard String Quartet and Avner Arad, who studied with Mr.
Firkusny, are to perform.
The event is open to the public; seating will be first come first served.
Mr.
Firkusny died in July at the age of 82.


Playing Comes First, Pain Is Second
In the first quarter in Monday night's game against Houston, Giants linebacker Carlton Bailey tried to jam a 300-pound offensive lineman, and Bailey took the brunt of the hit.
He said it felt as if someone had taken a hammer and driven it into his right shoulder.
He injured the shoulder socket and the pain was so bad that he couldn't lift his arm.
Both Bailey and the team said the injury wasn't serious, just painful.

Mexican Lawman Accuses Ruling Party in His Brother's Death
The official heading the investigation into the assassination of one of Mexico's most powerful politicians said today that the killing was ordered by an influential group within the ruling party, but that Mexico's Attorney General and current party leaders had kept him from proving it.
The investigator, Mario Ruiz Massieu, younger brother of the assassinated politician, also announced he had resigned his position as Deputy Attorney General.
He said he would send all the evidence he has gathered during a nearly two-month investigation to an independent notary public who would safeguard it until the incoming President, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, took office on Dec. 1 and decided what to do.

OPEC Move May Spur Sharp Rise in Oil Prices
Oil prices could rise by $2 to $3 a barrel within a year because of the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to freeze production at current levels while world consumption rises, industry analysts said yesterday.
The decision to hold the group's total production at 24.5 million barrels for another year was announced on Tuesday, at the conclusion of a meeting of OPEC's oil ministers on the Indonesian resort island of Bali.


Bond Rally Continues On Flight From Stocks
Treasury securities continued to rally yesterday for a second consecutive session, benefiting from a flight by investors out of stocks into bonds.
Bond prices surged early in the day day and gyrated through much of the trading, ending slightly below the highs for the day.

Reacting to Wall Street, European Markets Fall
Taking a cue from the steep drop in stock prices in the United States on Tuesday, markets across Europe plunged today as investors dumped stocks and sought refuge in bonds.
In London, equities fell nearly 1.7 percent.
In Paris and Milan, stock indexes were off 0.96 percent and 1.83 percent, respectively.
Here in Frankfurt, stocks were hit hardest, falling 2 percent.


Argentina Demotes Its Once-Powerful Armed Forces
Ever since Argentina's defeat by Britain in the Falkland War in 1982, the armed forces have been in decline here, and President Carlos Saul Menem has virtually eliminated any threat of a military coup through a series of reforms since taking office in 1990.
The Menem Government has cut military spending in half, reduced the armed forces to 20,000 troops from 100,000, retreated from unprofitable military enterprises and abolished mandatory military service in favor of a professional force.


Bridge
The controversy over the Women's Board-a-Match Teams, when a full session of play was canceled because some of the players had played the same deals four months earlier, has died down, but a similar problem seemed about to erupt at the American Contract Bridge League's Fall Nationals here.
An allegation that the deals played on Saturday in the final session of the Life Master Open Pair Championship were a repeat of those played in the Greenpoint Pairs six months ago in Manhattan was proved true by referring to this column's report of the event, which found a hand identical to a computer-generated hand played on Saturday.


U.S. Assets Of Briton Are Frozen
In a swift response yesterday to an accusation of illegal trading that occurred only 10 days ago, a United States district judge froze the assets in the New York brokerage account of a British businessman.
The account, held by Jeffrey C. Morris, owner of What's in Store, a British retail chain, held profits that the Securities and Exchange Commission contends were made on illegal insider information.
The agency says Mr.
Morris made $425,000 in illegal profits by purchasing stock and options in the Hilton Hotels Corporation while in possession of material, nonpublic information about Hilton.


Vincent Puts Down His Pen
Fay Vincent, the former baseball commissioner, said yesterday that he has decided not to complete and publish the book that he and a collaborator have been writing.
"I've decided that it's probably best for baseball and for me that I keep my counsel about the past," Vincent said in a telephone interview.
"Baseball has enough trouble. I don't need any more controversy in my life. I can't recall a time in my life when I've had more serenity. I've really enjoyed the peace and quiet."


Durable Orders Off 1.5% In First Drop Since July
Orders for long-lived manufactured products, a closely watched predictor of economic activity, fell last month for the first time since July in what some economists regarded as a sign the business expansion might be slowing.
"This does perhaps indicate that the economic boomlet may be subsiding," said Lynn Reaser, senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, as the Commerce Department reported a 1.5 percent decline in orders for durable goods, which range from camcorders to tanks.

The commission ordered the drug makers not to destroy documents relating to competition in the manufacture or sale of prescription drugs.


Suspect in Washington Shootings Had Past Weapons Convictions
The man who police say killed a District of Columbia police officer and two F.B.I. agents in a gun battle on Tuesday inside police headquarters here had a criminal record that included convictions on 13 weapons and ammunition charges, law-enforcement officials said today, and the 16-month probation he received after 18 months in jail had ended four days before the shootings.
The gunman, Bennie L. Lawson Jr., a 25-year-old former college student from the District, was also killed during the shooting.
Two other people, including an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, were wounded.


Police Disrupt Subway Service in Pursuit of a Robbery Suspect
City police officers chased a robbery suspect into a Manhattan subway tunnel yesterday and threw an emergency power switch, turning off electricity on several lines from Greenwich Village to Columbus Circle and inconveniencing more than 250,000 subway riders.
The incident shut down service on the A, B, C, D, E, F and Q trains for 1 hour 20 minutes, stranding a northbound E train in a tunnel just south of 42d Street, transit officials said.


Ruminations on Life By a Korean Minimalist
Sin Cha Hong, a Korean-born minimalist performer and choreographer, is at her best when she is simplest.
Miss Hong has a gift for expressing profound ideas about life, death and transcendence in a cross-stage walk or an odd lift of a body, for instance, as she did on Saturday night in a program of new work at the Annex Theater at La Mama.
Miss Hong moved along a diagonal path of diffuse light in "Above and Below," a solo set to an atmospheric score for piano and strings by Ki Young Kim.
Her torso strongly centered, though not always as powerfully as in earlier dances, she turned a little and bowed a little, creating a sense of a body transforming very slowly in space.
The spare, solid look of the solo was enhanced by Tae Ock Jin's costume, a boxy white overall made of rice paper.

Israeli Military Court Sentences Palestinian to Death in Bombing

It was the first time that a military court has called for capital punishment in a dozen years or more, Israeli civil-rights lawyers said, and they expressed doubts that the death sentence would be carried out, any more than the three or four others ordered in Israel in the past.

World War II France: Joie de Vivre Amid the Noms de Guerre
That the gaiety of Paris remained uncompromised throughout much of World War II remains a topic of some delicacy and relatively limited discussion.
Certainly it was still controversial in 1976, when "Chantons Sous L'Occupation" ("Singing Through the Occupation"), Andre Halimi's thoughtful, unflinching documentary on this subject, was shown in Paris to hostile public and critical response.
Opening today for a six-day run at the Walter Reade Theater, Mr.
Halimi's trenchant film uses images of sunny, uplifting show business personages to create a chilling mood.
The inspirational power of popular entertainment is shown to be profoundly disturbing when subverted, as it was in Occupied France, to raise morale artifically and quell the impulse to resist.

Awkward Questions After the Nazis Won
The plot of "Fatherland," a movie having its premiere tomorrow on HBO, is woven around an ingenious premise.
The year is 1964.
Twenty years earlier, Nazi Germany won World War II after the United States, listening to isolationists like Charles A. Lindbergh, withdrew from the Allied invasion.
Now Berlin, groaning under Albert Speer's elephantine architecture, prepares to celebrate Hitler's 75th birthday, which will be attended by the American President, Joseph P. Kennedy.
One problem: high-ranking officials of the Third Reich are mysteriously turning up dead.


TWO SENATORS VIE TO LEAD MINORITY
When Senate Democrats pick a new leader next week, they will be guessing at which of two relatively young, fairly liberal supporters of President Clinton can best make the party's case in a political era that seems devoted not to youth, not to liberalism and not to the President.
Neither of the two, Tom Daschle, a second-termer from South Dakota, and Christopher J. Dodd, a third-termer from Connecticut, has staked out any clear philosophical differences from the other.

Uranium Leak at Tennessee Laboratory Brings Fears of an Accidental Chain Reaction

An Editorial Debate: Should We Make Research Embryos?; No, Humans Are Not Lettuces
Ethics, somebody told me once, derive from repugnance.
Animals faced with the disgusting will simply walk away.
But we, having been blessed (or cursed) with a different kind of brain, will immediately construct a rationale for our response.
Possibly we, too, will walk away.
Just as possibly we will detect a virtue -- or, more likely, an advantage -- in staying.
Whatever the decision, we are almost certain to describe it as "ethical."
Using cells from aborted fetuses to investigate and maybe even cure certain remarkably cruel illnesses -- Huntington's chorea, for instance, and Alzheimer's disease -- has always struck me as equivalent to transplanting organs from the dead to the living.
Having accepted that procedure way back in Christiaan Barnard's day, I also accept the former.
But I can no more accept the notion that it is O.K. to create, and destroy, human embryos solely for research purposes than a cat can accept a rotting mouse.
Both reactions are instinctive, but mine demands explication.
Being human, I am forced, if only by myself, to build an ethical edifice.

Revisiting the World Of Rebels and Redcoats
Let's get the invidious comparisons out of the way.
"The American Revolution" is not "The Civil War." Momentous though it was, the war that began the United States does not grip the imagination like the war that might have ended it.
For 20th-century Americans, the Revolution does not have the dramatic force, the emotional resonance, the painful relevance of the Civil War, and the six-hour history that begins on Sunday does not pretend otherwise.
What "The American Revolution" does do is trace the background, dramatize the high moments and sketch some of the personalities and achievements of the remarkable company that gave us the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and political ideals that have never lost their glow.


An Editorial Debate: Should We Make Research Embryos?; Yes, the Gains Could Be Great
When a panel of experts proposed in September that the Federal Government start funding research on human embryos, they ignited a controversy.
Some people feel such research is inherently unethical, while many scientists think it has been needlessly curtailed.
The panel's recommendations, which apply only to embryos created in the laboratory, not to those created in the womb, will be reviewed next week at the National Institutes of Health.
The most inflammatory recommendation by far is that, in carefully defined circumstances, scientists should be able to create embryos solely for research and then destroy them when finished.
That has stirred fears that modern-day Frank-ensteins will soon create, destroy and tinker with life forms just to satisfy their intellectual curiosity.
But it strikes this observer that the panel of 19 scientists, ethicists, lawyers and others got the balance just about right.
It concluded that the embryo does not have the same moral status as infants or children -- and that research on such embryos holds the potential for great benefit.


Critic's Choice/Music; Troupe of Trouser Voices in Skirt Roles
Some people think La Gran Scena Opera company is a big joke.
But just because the audience laughs through most of its performances, just because the singers -- Vera Galupe-Borszkh, Sylvia Bills and Gabriella Tonnoziti-Casseruola -- tend to camp it up a bit, just because the company plunders the most outrageous scenes in opera and just because the program notes indicate that all these grand divas are actually divos doesn't mean that this company shouldn't be taken seriously.
Most of these singers, after all, need apologize to nobody for their phrasing or vocal range.
In the midst of their extravagance, they have an intimate acquaintance with the opera world, onstage and off.
And there are even times when mainstream productions seem to be imitating La Gran Scena, rather than the other way around.

More often, they have been cuddled in the palms of their aficionados, some of whom have assembled groups of the bags in vitrines in their living rooms or arranged them as centerpieces on dinner tables to take advantage of their decorative qualities.

All that physical apparatus is just a scaffold for what can become an intensely emotional mental exchange.
Here, you will enter the mind of one of the greatest master planners of all time.
You will survey the city through the eyes of the man who transformed it.
Then, moments after stepping inside that legendarily imperial dome, you may begin to discern an urban vision of your own.
Memories, hopes, triumphs, disappointments: these are among the landmarks on the private map that begins to take shape as you look around the Panorama.
The places you've lived, or wanted to.
The good or bad times you had there.
The connections and disconnections of a life lived in New York City.

Owners' Plan Has Payoff for Cardinals
If the 28 major league teams play baseball next year under the terms the owners are now proposing and their revenues and payrolls are what they had projected for this year, the Yankees will contribute the most money to the clubs' revenue-sharing pool, but the St.
Louis Cardinals will hold the most curious position.
The Cardinals, according to figures accompanying the tax proposal the clubs gave the players last week as a solution to end the 15-week-old strike, would receive money from the pool even though their revenue would be higher than the revenues of two teams -- Detroit and Oakland -- that would have to share some of their income with supposedly lower-revenue clubs.


Execution by Injection Can Be Botched, Too
To the Editor:
Like many advocates of the death penalty, Ernest van den Haag (letter, Nov. 18) is less offended by the fact of a state homicide than by the method employed.
Repulsed by the brutality of electrocutions, he recommends America's newest method for killing killers, lethal injection, as being "painless and nonrepulsive."


Market Place; For Stocks, New Fears Of a Slowing Economy
The stock market is suddenly becoming worried about the health of the economy.
The plunge in prices this month, and particularly in the last few days, has hit the cyclical stocks -- the issues most dependent on a strong economy -- the hardest.
At the same time, the battered bond market has suddenly gained strength.


Power Struggle Is Delaying Approval of Hospitals Chief
More than seven months after he was named to head the struggling Westchester County Medical Center, Edward A. Stolzenberg can point to some impressive gains: The hospital has allied with 11 managed-care organizations, its revenues are up and the average time that a patient stays there is down.
So why hasn't the County Board of Legislators voted on Mr.
Stolzenberg's nomination as hospitals commissioner by the County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke?


Flexing Fiscal Muscles: Mayor and Council at Loggerheads
For 11 months, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has had near total dominion at City Hall, with the Democratic-controlled City Council resignedly giving its approval to the Republican's austere $31.6 billion budget and vision of a far smaller government.
But now a slow accumulation of citizen pressure over continuing spending cuts, legislative grievances over Mr.
Giuliani's all-or-nothing style, and a sense that the Mayor has become vulnerable in the wake of the election of George E. Pataki as Governor have started to change the relationship between Mr.
Giuliani and the 51-member Council.

Critic's Choice/Film; A Jamaican Journeyer in Search of His African Roots
Howard A. Trott, the subject of Fritz Baumann's film "The Journey of the Lion," is a Jamaican Rastafarian who lives an impoverished existence with his two children in a shack on the outskirts of Kingston.
Disgusted with modern civilization, Brother Howie, as he is known, dreams of repatriation in Africa.
Out of the blue one day, he receives a letter from the sister he hasn't seen in 30 years inviting him to visit her in London.
Leaving Jamaica for the first time in his life, he embarks on a journey that takes him to England and eventually to Egypt and Ghana.

Russian Aid Under Siege By G.O.P.
Aid to Russia, always a contentious issue before Congress, is under siege by the new Republican majority, even though President Clinton has already cut Russian aid sharply from last year.
The two Republican Senators who are expected to be the most influential voices on foreign assistance -- Jesse Helms of North Carolina, in line to head the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who is likely to run the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Operations -- have repeatedly suggested that aid to Russia is too generous and vow to take an even tougher line next year.


The G.O.P. Assault on Welfare
The welfare reform proposal drafted by House Republicans would violate good sense by turning welfare programs over to the states.
It would violate common decency by victimizing millions of children, including legal immigrants.
It would even violate the reasonable notion that Government should help needy Americans willing to work.
What the House Republicans have in mind is not reform but a grotesque assault on the poor for the sake of honoring their ideological war on Government.
Its punitive measures go way beyond what conservative Democrats and Republicans, let alone President Clinton, have recently proposed.

Inflation Figures Go Up for 68th Straight Year
With wind nipping at their noses and fingertips, tens of thousands of New Yorkers lined the streets of Manhattan yesterday for the 68th annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.
Despite the chill, they roared approval at the blaring bands, prancing steeds, bulb-nosed clowns and, of course, the traditional pantheon of pumped-up heroes like Spiderman, Garfield, the Pink Panther, Snoopy, and, making his debut, Barney the dinosaur.
Bundled like Inuits on an ice floe, children sat cross-legged under police barricades or atop phone booths.
One youngster stole a perch on a story-high ladder behind the 10-deep crowd.
And some, their enthusiasm chilled a bit by temperatures in the upper 20's, still managed to wave as the clowns scampered about.

Unable to Protect Product Trademarks, Manufacturers Copyright the Boxes
If Parfums Givenchy and other premium-product makers continue to prevail in their use of copyright law, consumers could find fewer cut-rate deals on prestige perfume, cosmetics, crystal ware and other luxury goods at their local discount stores.

Germans in Tax Revolt Embrace Luxembourg
This tiny country nestled between France, Germany and Belgium may be best known for its castles, vineyards, rolling hills and stone-etched capital perched above a meandering river.
But to the German Government, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has become a royal thorn in the side.
Since 1993, when the Finance Ministry in Bonn imposed a 30 percent withholding tax on interest income for residents, Germans by the thousands have used Luxembourg to carry out a quiet but powerful tax revolt.

The football wasn't gift-wrapped, but on Monday night against the Houston Oilers when those deep passes came his way all evening, his eyes lighted up as if he had just seen all of the presents under the tree.
And when it was all over, he had 6 catches for 109 yards and 1 touchdown.


Discovering The Depths Behind Constable's Simplicity
JOHN CONSTABLE, who is the subject of an excellent exhibition at the Frick Collection, is a deceptively complicated artist.
His pictures can seem at a superficial glance mundane, even artless.
On the whole, they speak to nothing so much as peace, stability and the quiet meditation on everyday life beyond 19th-century London, a life that can seem very remote to American viewers today.
The extravagant paintings of his compatriot and contemporary, Turner, more readily conform to our 20th-century idea of advanced art as idiosyncratic and abstract.
But the simplicity of Constable's work is misleading.
On the one hand, there are his famous cloud studies, big oil sketches and some of the late paintings, where pigment is put down with a freedom that can bring to mind the Impressionists. (The French, not coincidentally, admired him before the English did, and more than they did Turner.) And on the other hand, there are the excessively labored pictures Constable painted to win acceptance at the Royal Academy in London.
The former are groundbreaking, the latter conformist, and it is this split that makes Constable such a curious and intriguing figure.

Fighting Rages as NATO Debates How to Protect Bosnian Enclave
Fierce fighting raged today around the Muslim enclave of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia when Serbian forces pursued a steady advance toward the center of the town and NATO allies failed to agree on how to save it.
In a move to discourage retaliatory bombings by NATO, Serbs immobilized about 200 United Nations troops and observers around Sarajevo and detained about 50 Canadian troops north of the capital.
The tactic, used by the Serbs in the past when they faced air strikes, left the peacekeepers virtual hostages.

In the strongest show of his career, Tony Oursler takes the concept of the talking head to places it hasn't been before, while giving the tired art of assemblage a needed boost.
His discombobulated video sculptures combine projected or on-screen faces and sometimes figures with discarded furniture, fabric or scarecrowlike stuffed garments.
They eerily bring to life a cast of unhappy characters who natter and curse, pound their fists, disparage themselves or the rest of us, or wedge themselves into tight places.
The overall effect is of a none-too-comforting stroll through a mental hospital, each piece representing a patient in a different state of torment.

Asia Society Offers a Rare Glimpse
Anyone who was in New York City and on the alert five summers ago may remember an untrumpeted but astonishing exhibition of sculpture at the Asia Society.

A major museum loan show?
No.
The sculptures were all from Asia Society's own permanent collection of 285 objects, established by the society's founder, John D. Rockefeller 3d, and his wife, Blanchette.
Oddly, the collection has been more rumored than seen.
For reasons never fully explained, it has been shown only once in its entirety: in 1981 when the society opened its Park Avenue headquarters.
Thereafter, it was confined to storage, where with the exception of a few outings, it has remained.

The evening was billed as an opportunity to learn how to break into modeling and acting, but there were few potential Cindy Crawfords, Naomi Campbells -- or for that matter, Elle MacPhersons -- who turned out to hear ELLE MacPHERSON the other evening.
The supermodel was giving a talk sponsored by the Learning Annex at the Park Central Hotel on Seventh Avenue.
But the audience of about 300 was mainly men, few of whom appeared headed for modeling careers.
What they wanted to know from Ms.
MacPherson had little to do with high fashion.
What was her idea of a romantic evening? one man asked.
Was she aware that the questioner had her picture on his night table along with his loved ones?
A third asked if she would go to his Taft High School prom with him.


Suicide Law Placing Oregon On Several Uncharted Paths
Early next month, Oregon will become the only place in the world where doctors may legally help patients end their lives.
With that comes a leap into the unknown: the hows, whens and whys of state-sanctioned suicide.
Edged into law by a bare majority of Oregon voters on Nov. 8, the decriminalization of assisted suicide is a triumph for groups that have been trying for years to wrest life-and-death decisions away from the state and the medical profession.


Treating Nazis in Art, Even Seriously, Is Risky
No doubt there are those who will take offense at "Mein Kampf," David Levinthal's new series of photographs at the Janet Borden Gallery.
Using toy soldiers and other figurines, Mr.
Levinthal sets up and photographs tableaux that tell the story of the rise of Hitler and the Nazi campaign to wipe out the Jews and others.
This is familiar if still horrifying material, and Mr.
Levinthal handles it with appropriate seriousness.
But the mere fact that he uses what are undeniably children's playthings to stage his vignettes may strike some as frivolous.


On Stage, and Off
Night of 100 Flashes
Stars, and their union, Actors' Equity, take a very dim view of people who take pictures in theaters; copyright problems aside, the flashes blind the actors, who then may blunder into the path of a 1,000-pound piece of rolling scenery.
At the matinee of "Sunset Boulevard" last Sunday, two flashes popped as Glenn Close made her entrance.
Normally, the ushers rush down the aisle with a cease-and-desist order, and, depending on how tough the house manager is, may seize the film.
But Sunday they were all in the lobby dealing with late arrivals.
So when Ms.
Close finished "With One Look," her big number about the power of her face as a silent-screen star, so many flashes went off that "it was like a lightning storm," a crew member said.


MILITARY PLANNING AN EXPANDED ROLE FOR THE RESERVES
Aiming to reduce the strain on active-duty troops, Defense Secretary William J. Perry has approved a plan to use reservists in many peacetime roles now performed by regular forces.
Recent military operations in Haiti, Rwanda, Cuba and the Persian Gulf have exposed cracks in the combat readiness of America's 1.6-million-member military.
With the armed forces shrinking and military commitments likely to remain high in the future, the Defense Department is scrambling to avoid a crisis.


Miami Beach Journal; Kosher Pizza: Sign of a Jewish Revival
At Shimmy's Pizza on Arthur Godfrey Road here, the busiest time is Saturday night, when the wait may be 30 minutes to order a large pie with lots of cheese, but never any sausage.
Shimmy's, which is new to the block, is a dairy restaurant and is strictly kosher.
Along Arthur Godfrey Road, Shimmy's is just one of the stores and restaurants that have opened in the past few years to serve a growing population of modern Orthodox Jews.
Vacant storefronts have yielded to businesses like Kosher World, a grocery store; Torah Treasures, which sells books and Judaica, and Alisa's, which sells hats and wigs that married Orthodox women wear to cover their heads when they are in the presence of anyone but their husbands, as required by Jewish law.
Shimmy Weiss says his pizza place has been successful enough that he hopes to open a second restaurant serving hamburgers.


Burnett Has an Eye On Heinz's Rivals
The Leo Burnett Company says it will probably consider working for marketers that sell pet foods and other products that compete against a longtime former client, the H. J. Heinz Company.
"We'll be open to any client" in those categories, Tom Ross, executive vice president for client services at Burnett in Chicago, said on Wednesday.
His comment came after Burnett and Heinz unexpectedly disclosed that they had mutually agreed to end their relationship on accounts like 9-Lives cat food and cat treats, Star-Kist tuna, Heinz ketchup and Heinz 57 steak sauce.


R. L. Patterson Jr.; Orthopedist Was 87
Dr.
Robert Lee Patterson Jr., an orthopedic surgeon and former surgeon in chief at the Hospital for Special Surgery on East 70th Street in Manhattan, died last Friday at his home in Mount Kisco, N.Y.
He was 87.
Dr.
Patterson served on the hospital staff for 36 years, starting in 1936.
He became surgeon in chief in 1963 and retired in 1972.
An expert on shoulder diseases and disorders, he concurrently had been a professor of orthopedic surgery at Cornell University Medical College since 1963.

Fresnes Journal; Sad Voyages to France: In One School, Many Sagas
Sabine Contrepois well remembers the day two years ago when she explained to her high-school class how the Vietnam War eventually spilled into Cambodia.
Suddenly, Meak, an Asian girl in the front row, burst into tears.
"I asked her what was wrong," Mrs.

"She said her father was shot the day the Khmer Rouge took power in Cambodia in 1975. She and her mother spent years in concentration camps before they escaped through Thailand. There was absolute silence in the classroom."

In "Lillehammer '94: 16 Days of Glory," the filmmaker Bud Greenspan covers the Nancy-Tonya story in 30 seconds.

Little Switch Pays a Big Dividend for Lions
Jim Kelly had thrown a bushel of passes to his running backs and the Buffalo Bills were outperforming the Detroit Lions in this matchup of back versus linebacker in the Silverdome today.
So there was little surprise when, with 1 minute 35 seconds to play and Buffalo trailing by 28-21, Kelly began a Bills' drive from his 16 with a 9-yard pass, out of the shotgun, to a running back, Thurman Thomas.
This time, though, the Lions altered the matchup.





Beauty and Heroism Emerge From Snarls and Tangles
No bar, grill or coffee shop ever had a juke box like the one Garth Fagan devised in 1985 when he choreographed "Never Top 40 (Juke Box)," the suite that Garth Fagan Dance has revived at the Joyce Theater.
The title suggests that Mr.
Fagan was well aware that a juke box with jazz records and an arrangement of "Over the Rainbow" is unlikely also to offer a Puccini aria and 17th- and 20th-century musical versions of the Psalms.
Mr.
Fagan put together dances to all these accompaniments in "Never Top 40." It was therefore appropriate that his program note is a quotation from the contemporary Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz: "Life is plurality. Death is uniformity."

Who Needs Aikman? Garrett Does Job
Things looked very grim today for the Dallas Cowboys in the first half.
They were playing fugitive football.
The rookie right tackle Larry Allen was being haunted by a one-armed man -- Green Bay Packers defensive end Reggie White -- who kept trying to bury his quarterback.
Jason Garrett, starting in place of Troy Aikman, kept running for his life.
And the Cowboy defense, ranked No. 1 in the National Football League, was in hiding, too.
The Cowboys trailed by 17-6 at the half, and it looked as if the Packers were on their way to a rout.
But then the Cowboys sprang to life.
Allen got some halftime advice from the injured tackle Erik Williams, Garrett got back to the game plan and the Cowboys ripped off 36 points -- the most in a second half in the team's history -- to beat the Packers by 42-31.


Fed Raises Interest Rates on Dubious Grounds; How to Fight Inflation
To the Editor:
After five interest rate increases this year, the Fed has done it again.
In light of all the mischief and dismay these increases have created, has anyone bothered actually to assess their direct effect on inflation?
As far as I can see they have, at best, had no effect whatever.
The lame, convenient excuse is that it takes anywhere from 6 to 18 months for the effect to show up.
Nonsense!
If interest rates go up today, they affect your next borrowing decision.


Lowe Will Keep A Citibank Account
The Citibank North America unit of Citicorp in New York has retained Lowe &amp; Partners/SMS in New York on its domestic credit card account after a two-month review.
The account, with billings estimated at $60 million, has been handled by Lowe since 1980.
The review was narrowed to Lowe and one other finalist, J. Walter Thompson New York.
It is one of a few recent instances of a client retaining an incumbent agency after a review on a large, important account.
Lowe is participating in a review on another big account, Prudential Insurance.


Plan for Toxic Dump Off Coney I. Is Attacked
Rebuffed in its bid to dump 150,000 tons of dioxin-tainted sand in the ocean six miles off Sandy Hook, N.J., the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is considering a plan to deposit the material in a pit a half mile off Coney Island.
Residents of Coney Island and Staten Island have begun letter-writing and petition drives against the plan and nearly 300 people showed up at a recent protest meeting in Sheepshead Bay.
Community Board 3, which oversees most of Staten Island's recreational beaches, has passed a motion condemning the plan.
And fisherman say the area around the pit is teeming with fish that could be poisoned, destroying the catch of charter boats and commercial fisherman, many of whom sell at the Fulton Fish Market.


Enough Salt for the Winter, Mine Officials Say
The giant piles of salt that surround one of the world's largest salt mines here bode well for drivers in New York City and across the Northeast -- even as the mine fills with up to 18,000 gallons of water every minute.
Officials with Akzo Nobel Salt in Livingston County say they have enough salt on hand to get through this winter, and enough life left in the mine to keep one of the county's largest employers going until a new mine is open in 1996.

Tony Oursler Metro Pictures 150 Greene Street (at Houston Street) SoHo Through tomorrow
In the strongest show of his career, Tony Oursler takes the concept of the talking head to places it hasn't been before, while giving the tired art of assemblage a needed boost.
His discombobulated video sculptures combine projected or on-screen faces and sometimes figures with discarded furniture, fabric or scarecrowlike stuffed garments.
They eerily bring to life a cast of unhappy characters who natter and curse, pound their fists, disparage themselves or the rest of us, or wedge themselves into tight places.
The overall effect is of a none-too-comforting stroll through a mental hospital, each piece representing a patient in a different state of torment.

BACKLOG OF CASES IS OVERWHELMING JOBS-BIAS AGENCY
In the heat and hopes of the civil rights strife of a generation ago, Congress created an agency to stop discrimination in the workplace.
Today that agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, is choking on bureaucracy and a mounting backlog of discrimination complaints from blacks, women and other people it is supposed to protect.
And even as Congress expands the pool of protected people, most recently with the 1990 law to fight discrimination against disabled workers, the commission's staff is shrinking under the pressure of tight budgets.

Greenaway, Operatic Natural
Perhaps the most surprising thing about Peter Greenaway's first foray into opera is that he has not been there before.
His training as a painter, the visual extravagance of his movies, his interest in music and his delight in experimentation all seemed to be leading him in this direction.
"My cinema has become more and more operatic as I have dabbled with the English tradition of pseudo-realism and notions of truth," the British film director explained.
"Finally, I thought, why not push the boat out all the way and see what I could do operatically with this?"

Five Years Later: Eastern Europe, Post-Cummunism -- A special report; Ethnic and Religious Conflicts Now Threaten Europe's Stability
Five years after the fall of the Berlin wall, Checkpoint Charlie has moved 600 miles southeast to a bridge over the Miljacka River in Sarajevo, where coils of barbed wire and occasional tearful family reunions testify to the new divisions of Europe.
Here at the bridge, Benjamin Hamidovic, a Bosnian Muslim, stands guard.
He gazes out, past the wire and the French United Nations soldiers in their blue helmets, to the far side, held and guarded by Bosnian Serbs.
It is very close, the other bank, but eerily distant -- another land in a severed city.


Angola on the Brink of Peace
For 19 years Angolans have fought one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars, fueled by cold-war rivalries and costing half a million lives.
On Sunday the two sides signed a peace treaty in Lusaka, Zambia -- the third attempt to end the conflict.
If it is to succeed, the international community will have to keep up the pressure on both sides and offer some substantial help.
In the end, however, the warring parties will have to show a little statesmanship.
The rebel leader Jonas Savimbi did not show up for the signing, saying he feared leaving Angola; the document was signed by proxies.
In the following days the Government charged that his Unita rebels were still fighting; Unita made similar counterclaims.
By Wednesday the Government radio station said the truce was holding, as the two sides worked out the details of a power-sharing arrangement that will lead to an election in 1996.


Winless and Clueless Clippers Lose to Nets
The Nets momentarily lost their composure and the Clippers eventually lost their 12th straight game.
On nights like these in the National Basketball Association, when the arena is half-empty and a shooting guard from a Division II school provides the game's only dramatic moment, you're left with this: These guys apparently deserve one another.
In the league's Game of the Weak, the Nets nearly lost a 15-point fourth-quarter lead, Kenny Anderson turned the ball over three times in the last 1 minute 20 seconds and Harold Ellis scored a Clippers-record 19 fourth-quarter points before the Nets escaped with a 107-102 victory.

Maine Helps Utility Buy Power Plant
Customers of the Central Maine Power Company pay some of the highest electricity rates in the country, but this is beginning to change with an unusual helping hand from the State of Maine.
The state provided $64 million in financing that helped Central Maine Power buy one of the independent power plants that sold it electricity last month.
By acquiring the plant, Central Maine was able to cancel a long-term contract that forced the utility to buy power from the plant at far above market rates, costs that were then passed on to Central Maine's customers.
Next Thursday, the utility, which is based in Augusta, will lower customer rates for the first time in seven years.

A Display of Flexibility By Montserrat Caballe
One thing was apparent very early in Montserrat Caballe's recital at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday evening, and that was that her style involves a tradeoff of sorts.
What she offers is a sweet, beautifully manipulated and, in her best moments, seductively sensual sound.
But much of the time, this sheer vocal beauty comes at a cost in depth.
How serious a problem that is depends on what a listener looks for in a recital.
There are times, after all, when one is grateful for ravishing vocalism and willing to overlook everything else.
Perhaps the best example of this transaction at work on Tuesday was Haydn's "Grande Scena di Berenice," a showpiece that draws both its form and its energy from touching on emotional extremes, and which demands considerable vocal flexibility.
Flexibility was no problem for Miss Caballe.
She moved easily between the scene's recitative and aria sections, regulating color and dynamics in much the same way a master instrumentalist might.
It was consistently elegant singing.
Yet the work's drama and emotionalism seemed locked behind a patrician veneer.

Energy Efficiency Works, and It Saves Money

IT was 7:45 A.M. and as many as 50 people were already assembled at each of the entrances of Macy's, the galaxy's largest store.
Through the locked doors, clerks could be seen rushing more stuff onto shelves in preparation for the busiest shopping day, which fell as it must on the day after Thanksgiving.
In one vestibule on 34th Street, a quiet sort of nervousness prevailed, the same sort of tension runners show at the start of a marathon.
The shoppers seemed into themselves, trying to get focused, keeping their pulse rates low to better go the distance.


Stores Say No to Sales Taxes, for a Day
For John and Tammy Guerriero, it was one of those pleasant little surprises at the mall.

"Geez, we might come back for another pair," said Mr.

Reject the New Arms Guidelines
America has a rare chance to use its dominant position in the arms market to inhibit the international traffic in weaponry.
Unfortunately, new guidelines governing American arms sales abroad, now on President Clinton's desk, would toss away that chance.
With the end of the cold war, global arms sales began to dry up and competition intensified to capture what was left of the market.
The demonstrated prowess of American arms in the Persian Gulf war allowed the U.S. to dominate the market, accounting for well over half the world's sales.
That would enable Washington to take the lead in restraining sales, especially to volatile regions like the Middle East.


UMass Stuns Arkansas, Making It Look Easy

Needle Exchange Programs Shown to Slow H.I.V. Rates
In the midst of a driving November rain, a woman in a stiff wig and a soiled trench coat approached a converted ice-cream truck in East Harlem and exchanged a brown-paper bag of used hypodermic needles for a bag of new ones.
Into the bag went several condoms and the friendly admonition, "Use them; be safe."
It was just another day for the people inside the white truck that houses one of New York's needle-exchange programs.
Intravenous drug users come to the van, which parks on the street, and trade used needles for new ones in an effort to slow the spread of AIDS through shared needles.

Major league club owners are prepared to take one of three steps when they meet in Chicago on Dec. 5, players were told in a memo they received from the union this week, but management's most likely action will be a vote on implementation of a salary cap.
In the memo dated Nov. 22 -- a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times -- Donald Fehr, the head of the union, told the players that John Harrington, the owners' labor spokesman, stated the clubs' intentions at the last bargaining session last Saturday.


Italy Faces a Different Kind of Government Crisis
It is not unusual for Italian governments to be labeled shaky or fractious or frail or embattled; the country, after all, has had 52 of them since World War II.
So there has been plenty of time -- and more than enough governments -- to build a political vocabulary suggesting that instability is as endemic as the common cold.
It is not unusual, either, for them to teeter, dissolve and then re-form, like the colors in a kaleidoscope.


Use of Army to Fight Crime in Rio Makes Many Feel Safer in Streets
Two olive green Panther helicopters droned in wide circles over the vast, human amphitheater of the Nova Brasilia shantytown.
But in the shadows of one narrow alley, one cocaine trafficker said an eventual occupation by Brazilian Army soldiers gave him no fear.
"The army won't come in to massacre us," said the trafficker, a lean young man sporting new sneakers.
"Our guns will be hidden. There won't be any shooting."


NATO Jets Fly but Don't Bomb As Bosnian Serbs Attack Enclave
NATO planes flew repeatedly over the Muslim enclave of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia today after nationalist Serbs shelled the center of the embattled town.
But the aircraft returned to base without dropping any bombs.
After a day in which his sentiments on the fate of the Bihac pocket seemed to swing violently, Lieut.
Gen.
Sir Michael Rose, the commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, called in NATO air strikes against the attacking Serbs.
But with night already blanketing the Bihac area, the NATO pilots were apparently unable to find their targets.


Creating an Estate Vehicle
In 1988, when his oldest child entered high school, Dr.
Edward J. Zelnick told his longtime tennis buddy that he wanted to do some estate planning.
He was in his peak earning years and in good health.
His friend suggested that he shift money to his children in the form of an insurance trust to reduce the doctor's estate, which is subject to probate, estate taxes and any action by creditors.
In addition, the money could serve as a source of funds for college if the parents were unable to pay for any reason, said the adviser, Larry Schweiger, who is president of Unisyn Securities America, an insurance agent and tax strategist.

If David Meggett has something on the Washington Redskins, he isn't letting on.
Meggett has thrown a touchdown pass from the halfback option the last three times the Giants and the Redskins have met.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL Injured Zeier Says He'll Play in a Bowl Eric Zeier wasted no time assuring any bowl committee that might be wondering about his injury status.
"I'm going to be ready for the bowl game," Zeier said yesterday in Athens, Ga., after leaving Georgia's 48-10 rout of Georgia Tech in the second quarter with sprained ligaments in his right knee.
"I thought it was hurt a lot worse than it was," Zeier said.
"It's going to be fine. I'll be back in a couple of weeks." Zeier passed for 115 yards and 2 touchdowns before he went down with 7 minutes 34 seconds left in the second quarter.
Georgia (6-4-1) qualified for a bowl game by winning its finale, handing Tech its ninth loss in a 1-10 season.
Zeier completed his career No. 3 on the National Collegiate Athletic Association pass yardage list with 11,153, trailing Brigham Young's Ty Detmer with 15,031 and San Diego State's Todd Santos with 11,425. (AP)


Nebraska Still Has A Question To Answer
As Tom Osborne moved within one victory of his first national title in 22 years as head coach of Nebraska, he opened the door to a sizable quarterback controversy.
The No. 1-ranked Cornhuskers (12-0) struggled to a 13-3 victory over Oklahoma before 70,216, their seventh straight with Brook Berringer as the team's starting quarterback.
Yet Osborne admitted "looking at Tommie a few times" when the game was tied 3-3 at halftime.

Through the locked doors, clerks could be seen rushing more stuff onto shelves in preparation for the busiest shopping day, which fell as it must on the day after Thanksgiving.
In one vestibule on 34th Street, a quiet sort of nervousness prevailed, the same sort of tension runners show at the start of a marathon.
The shoppers seemed into themselves, trying to get focused, keeping their pulse rates low to better go the distance.

If they are JERRY and EILEEN FORD, it's at a luxury camp in Mala Mala, South Africa, eating roast impala and chocolate cake and sipping champagne sent by their office in New York.
"It was the most exotic trip of our lives," Mrs.

"We ate in an outdoor room enclosed by 20-foot-high reeds and open to the sky, and we never had a better time." No faint praise, considering that most trips the Fords have made, traveling the world in search of models, could legitimately be considered exotic.
The Fords founded the Ford Models agency in 1946.

With the ascension of Joseph L. Bruno as the presumptive majority leader of the State Senate, Governor-elect George E. Pataki has gained a political and philosophical soul mate at the top of state government.
Mr.

And unlike the man he deposed, Ralph J. Marino, he is both a gregarious colleague in the Senate and an eager, sharp-tongued spokesman for his beliefs.

Time for a Budget Truce
The New York City Council has picked the wrong time to assert its power over the budget.
The city admittedly faces tough choices because current spending must be cut by at least $800 million.
Moreover, Council concerns over Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's October proposal that much of the cutting be imposed on social services are justified.
But the Council's authority to vote its own plan is ambiguous.
Both sides should want the courts to clear up the ambiguity, though it would be risky and costly to delay cuts while courts ruminate.
This confrontation is over political muscle, not fiscal details.
The revised City Charter gave the Council substantially more power than before.
Up to this point, the Council has not exploited that power aggressively.
Now its Democratic majority is embarrassed by its failure to press for more changes in the new Republican Mayor's original budget when it could have done so last June.
Members are also angry that he now proposes to cancel some of the few changes they made.
June was the time to fight.
Not now.


Bridge
A neck problem indirectly decided the result of the Blue Ribbon Pair Championship at the American Contract Bridge League's Fall Nationals here on Thursday night.

His house guest, Alexander Weiland of Glenview, Ill., replaced him and the new partnership won the three-day event by more then two boards.
Weiland, returning to the tournament scene after an eight-year hiatus, won his first national title.
Lair, an experienced professional who stands third on the list of master-point winners, won his 16th.

This Christmas Eve, more than a few inner-city parishes will hold Midnight Mass early in the evening so that parishioners can get home safely.

Tax Date Looms for Bullish
To the short list of important dates in your relationship with the Internal Revenue Service -- Dec. 31 and April 15 -- this year add Nov. 29.
The date is important for bullish investors who plan to "accelerate capital losses," or close out losing investment positions before the year ends.
While all investors can gain tax advantages by selling losers before year-end, those who are bullish may want to act by Tuesday, the deadline this year for "doubling up." The strategy is to buy additional shares of losing securities now and sell the original shares for a loss on Dec. 30.
In this way, investors can lower their 1994 tax bills while leaving themselves poised to catch any market run-up in January.

Smith Makes Skeptics Re-evaluate
Charles Smith is surprised that his recent precise and powerful play has surprised observers.
The persistent questions, the sweet compliments and the quizzical stares have enveloped Smith while he has performed smoothly for the Knicks this month.
Astute enough to gauge the situation, Smith has realized that these reactions indicate that his revival was unexpected.
Maybe people did not believe that his left knee was injured.
Maybe they did not think he would be the reliable player the Knicks invested $26 million in.
Maybe they refused to forget those three missed layups against Chicago in the Eastern Conference finals last year.
Smith thinks that the doubts about his injury have been unfair.


Apprentice Breaks Collarbone In Fall
New York's weekend of holiday racing took a bad turn yesterday when the apprentice jockey Dale Beckner fell from his mount at Aqueduct, fractured his right collarbone and was lost for probably two months.
Beckner, who is 21 years old, was the third-leading rider at Aqueduct's fall meeting when he went down shortly after the start of the third race.
His mount, Young and Regal, took a misstep on the backstretch and pitched him to the ground.
The jockey was taken to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I., where Dr.
Andy Somma diagnosed his injury as a broken clavicle, and held him for observation because of tingling in his left foot.

Arthur Russell reveals a gentle soul in the 15 songs on "Another Thought," which were recorded from 1982 to 1990, two years before he died of AIDS.
In the 1970's and 80's, Mr.
Russell performed regularly at places like the Kitchen; he also made singles geared for dance clubs.
Most of the selections on "Another Thought" (Point Music/Polygram 438 891) are solos for voice and cello that tuck a world of influences into puckish, resolutely optimistic songs.


Gretzky and His Ad-Hoc Team Trying to Enlist Leetch
While negotiators tried again to settle a labor dispute that has postponed the start of the National Hockey League season for eight weeks, the sport continued to mutate today in ad-lib fashion.
Like boys on the winter pond, the superstars of a generation are putting together a pickup team to hit the road, play and have a little fun.
Wayne Gretzky started it.
Then Mark Messier came on board and so did Sergei Fedorov and more than a dozen others.

All Tchaikovsky, Leading With Leonskaja
With Thanksgiving opening the holiday season, Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic are taking a break from their investigations of the symphonic repertory's deeper reaches.
Their offering on Wednesday evening (there are repeats tonight and Tuesday) was essentially a pops concert disguised as an all-Tchaikovsky program.
The first half of the concert was given over to Tchaikovsky's blustery Piano Concerto No. 1, for which Elisabeth Leonskaja was the soloist.
It was a puzzling reading.
At times, textures in the solo line were fuzzy and indistinct, as if Miss Leonskaja were wearing mittens.
Elsewhere she summoned considerable clarity and force, and even a touch of impetuousness that enlivened parts of the outer movements.
Yet on the whole there was little in this gray reading to capture the imagination.


Short Day Gives Dow 33.64 Gain
The stock market recovered yesterday about a fifth of the ground it has lost since Nov. 16.
The few traders on the floor in a shortened session on the day after Thanksgiving tended to buy interest rate-sensitive stocks whose prices had fallen because of the Federal Reserve's six increases in short-term interest rates so far this year.
Bond prices were mixed, and the dollar was little changed.
European stock traders bid down prices overseas yesterday, convinced that when most of Wall Street returns on Monday, stock prices in the United States will continue their slide.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.64 points, to 3,708.27, while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 2.36 points, to 452.29.
The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 5.82 points, to 742.52.
Still, the Dow had fallen for five sessions in a row before yesterday, for a total drop of more than 170 points.
Yesterday's advance meant about a 20 percent recovery in the Dow.
"I had been expecting something of a snapback," said James B. Macko, vice president for equity trading at McDonald &amp; Company Investments in Cleveland.
"But I had expected it next week. Today may be a small portion of that snapback."
Broader indexes have also fallen.
The S.&amp; P. 500 had fallen 15.69 points in five sessions, and with yesterday's advance had recovered about 15 percent.
The Nasdaq index dropped 32.94 points for the same period and gained back nearly 18 percent.
Even one of the broadest possible measures, the Wilshire index of 5,000 stocks, had dropped 165.55 points, but recovered nearly 17 percent.
Yesterday, seven stocks advanced for every three that declined, or 1,496 winning stocks and 564 losing stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was far below normal at 113.9 million shares because the exchange closed at 1 P.M., instead of 4 P.M.
In Europe, British stock prices fell one-tenth of 1 percent, German stocks fell two-tenths of 1 percent, but French stocks rose six-tenths of 1 percent.
While local issues affected the outcome, most traders cited uncertainty in American financial markets as a drag on their markets.
In Britain, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 issues fell 3.1 points, to 3,033.5, in part because Prime Minister John Major faced a parlimentary vote on Monday on payments to the European Union that threatens to bring down his Government.
In Germany, the DAX index of 30 stocks fell 4.35 points, to 2,051.62, as some investors started shifting investments to bonds out of stocks.
But in France, the CAC index of 40 stocks rose 11.21 points, to 1945.89.
In the United States, most stocks that advanced were those that investors had shunned at earlier points in the year because of the Fed's tightening of interest rates.
These groups included chemical companies, drug manufacturers, retailers, computer software developers, electric utilities, computer makers and banks.
American depository receipts of Sony rose 1 1/4, to 51 3/4, despite a large write-off for its movie-studio operations and yesterday's resignation of its co-founder, Akio Morita.
Mr.
Morita suffered a cerebral hemorrhage a year ago.
Musicland Stores established a 52-week low of 12 3/8, down 2.
A Smith Barney analyst lowered her assessment of the speciality retailer to "underperform" from "neutral, " citing discount pricing and higher advertising costs.
The most active stock, at 2.4 million shares, was Intel, which fell 1 1/4, to 63 7/8.
The company has acknowledged that its Pentium computer chip could cause inaccurate results in rare cases in complex scientific calculations and that newer chips have been corrected.
Shares of Gibson Greetings rose 1 1/8, to 13 7/8.
Gibson and Bankers Trust announced on Wednesday that they had agreed to settle Gibson's lawsuit accusing the bank of improperly leading the company to engage in risky financial trades.
Bankers Trust shares rose 3/8, to 57 1/8.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.42 points, to 247.60, and the American Stock Exchange market value index gained 2.29 points, to 434.69.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 21 rose, led by Alcoa, which rose 2 3/8, to 80 3/8.
Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.&amp; P. 500, 286 rose, led by Merck, which gained 3/4, to 36 5/8.
In Tokyo, stocks were slightly lower.
The Nikkei index of 225 issues lost 34.31 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent, at 18,666.93.
For the week, which was shortened by a national holiday on Wednesday, the Nikkei was down 635.63 points.


Saving on Taxes On Staten Island


In Jeffries Case, Bill of Rights Is at Risk
To the Editor:
"Fine-Tuning the Jeffries Case" (editorial, Nov. 17) supports the Supreme Court's decision to reopen the possibility of removing Prof.
Leonard Jeffries as chairman of the black studies department at the City College of New York.
You argue that although the college shouldn't revoke his tenure and right to speak as freely as he wishes as a faculty member, the college "need not bestow chairmanships" on those who have spoken as he has.


Ally of Pataki Replaces Marino As State Senate Majority Leader
Governor-elect George E. Pataki moved briskly toward consolidating his control over both state government and the fractious state Republican Party yesterday when his allies in the State Senate ousted one of his chief rivals from the powerful position of majority leader.
The coup not only installed a leading Pataki supporter, Senator Joseph L. Bruno, in the Senate's top job, but also demonstrated again the ascendancy among state Republicans of Mr.
Pataki's patron, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, whose lobbying helped insure the insurgents' victory.


For New Innkeepers, a Worry Season; The Solitude of a Winter Island Tests Hopes for a New Life
Raw winds tear across the moors and ponds of this mostly treeless speck of land off the tip of Long Island, rattling the window panes of the empty Atlantic Inn, and sometimes the nerves of its new proprietors, Anne and Brad Marthens.
The Marthens, formerly of Cheshire, Conn., traded in their lives of upward mobility on the mainland to take up innkeeping here in October, just as the hectic summer season was settling into the gray of winter an hour's ferry ride out into the Atlantic Ocean.
They've never run an inn before, they're about a million dollars in debt, and they have all winter to brood over it in a closed-for-the-season Victorian inn on an island where the winter population drops to about 800.


Battling Neighbors
Fordham University has a very big problem: a radio transmitter that, once built, will be 480 ungainly feet tall.
The New York Botanical Garden also has a very big problem: The antenna is directly across the street and all too visible from much of this essentially sylvan site.
There is no doubt how this squabble between neighbors needs to come out.
Common sense, esthetics and the importance to the city of this botanical jewel virtually dictate that Fordham find another site for its tower.
Fordham asked for a construction permit to build a new transmitter in 1983, three years before new Federal Communications Commission regulations made one mandatory for a license renewal for WFUV-FM, the university's radio station.
The old transmitter, a discreet antenna atop the school's Keating Hall, does not meet the new guidelines, which are designed to reduce public exposure to radio waves.


Goldman Wins Big Role in German Sale
Ending months of speculation and intense competition among the world's leading investment bankers, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company was named today to coordinate the sale of Deutsche Telekom, the state telephone monopoly, to investors outside Germany.
The appointment will mean huge investment banking fees for Goldman as the sale of Deutsche Telekom, valued at up to $60 billion, will be the largest privatization in Europe and the second largest globally, after the $70 billion privatization of Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone.
The deal will also solidify Goldman's position as one of the leading sellers of telecommunications securities at a time when the industry in Europe is undergoing great change, as governments sell off large holdings.


Public &amp; Private; Sex For Sale
There's something quaint about the prosecution of Heidi Fleiss.
And it's not only that being accused of making money by selling sex in Hollywood, home of the casting couch and the gratuitous nude scene, is so rich with irony that it's a better subject for a comic novel than a column.
It's the strange prospect of law enforcement types blazing in to save our society from getting caught in the dangerous crossfire of genitals for hire.
On one coast the cops are busting sex workers on Eighth Avenue, dragging them downtown to night court where they pay the fine and go right back to their corner; on another they're charging Heidi Fleiss with pandering in a town in which the verb is a term of art.


Low-Cost Dwellings Helping Bluebirds
ON an Indian summer day, scores of brilliantly colored Eastern bluebirds perched in a long line along a telephone wire.
The wire ran across the front of an open field deep inside Ward Pound Ridge Reservation, a county-owned park in this rural village.
On warm fall days, Westchester residents can see this remarkable environmental success story for themselves.
It is remarkable because many Americans have never seen a bluebird.


Journal; The Victory Rush
Of all those saying "I told you so" to the Democrats this month, no one is louder than Rush Limbaugh, whose latest best seller is conveniently titled "See, I Told You So" and whose voice reaches some 20 million Americans each week.
Like any good masochistic liberal, I started listening to Mr.
Limbaugh immediately after Nov. 8 -- curious to hear how he'd sound in full gloat instead of rabid attack, certain to find him overplaying his post-election hand by indulging in the boorishness of the sore winner.
Mr.
Limbaugh outwitted me.
While his opponents stumble about in disarray, still waiting for firm leadership from the White House, he is already with the next Republican program, advancing his armies of loyal "dittoheads" toward '96.


Accessible Broadway: The Cheap Seats

Sending Marines 'Prudent'
Three Navy ships carrying 2,000 marines headed toward the Adriatic Sea today in what the Pentagon called a "strictly precautionary" response to increased fighting around Bihac, in northwestern Bosnia.
When the move was announced on Friday, a statement issued by the United States European Command called the deployment "a prudent measure to enhance the capabilities of our forces supporting the United Nations." The Pentagon declined to elaborate, but the marines, who have helicopters, would presumably be able to rescue any NATO pilots who might be shot down or to evacuate United Nations peacekeepers.


Versatile Butternut Squash A Cook's Favorite Standby
OF all the varieties of hard-skinned winter squashes, butternut appears to have emerged as the cook's favorite.
And with good reason.
Within the smooth beige shell that covers this oddly shaped vegetable is dense, deep-orange flesh that is richer-tasting and less watery or stringy than most of the sturdy cold-weather squashes.
It is a versatile vegetable, good for baking as well as for cooking.
And because it holds up well at room temperature for weeks, it can be kept on hand to use whenever it is needed.

Nepali Rivals Are at an Impasse Over Forming a Government
More than a week after elections produced a divided Parliament, the two main political groups, the Communists and the centrist Nepali Congress Party, are at an increasingly tense impasse over which will form the new Government.
Neither party has been able to line up a coalition partner to assure a majority in the 205-seat Parliament.
The uncertainty has created a new constitutional crisis for King Birendra, who was forced by mass protests into ceding his ruling powers to Parliament in 1990.


And Tonight's Party Is in Honor of . . .
The social calendar this month has been a whirlwind of people, places and events.
Now sampling nine parties, Nov. 10-21.


Elissa Williamson, Richard Scogland
Elissa Haywood Williamson, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Phillip Williamson of Westport, Conn., was married yesterday to Richard William Scogland, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Richard E. Scogland of Marblehead, Mass.
The Rev.
Jane Brendel, a minister of the Church of Religious Science, officiated at Waveny House in New Canaan, Conn.
Ms.
Williamson-Scogland, 25, is a teacher at the Theater Workshop and Enrichment Program of Davenport House in Marblehead.
She and her husband graduated from Bentley College.
She received a master's degree in education from Harvard University.
Her father is a senior director for Alamo Rent A Car.
Her mother, known professionally as Betty Jinnette, is an actress.


Neutral-Site Visitations Urged
JEANNIE T. had a restraining order against her ex-husband, who had beaten her repeatedly during their marriage and continued to threaten her during their divorce proceedings.
The couple had a 2-year-old child, and -- because of the husband's history of violent behavior -- the judge ordered that the father's visits to his daughter be supervised.
Mrs.
T. was grateful that her daughter was to be protected, but her relief was short lived.
The judge, who himself had granted the order of protection for Mrs.
T., also named her as the supervisor of the visits.
"It was awful," said Mrs T., whose last name is being withheld because she fears further repercussions from her ex-husband.
"I had to be in the same room with him, in the car with him and oversee everything that went on with the baby. I did it because I had to protect my daughter. But it was terrible."


School Prayer Can Both Exclude and Coerce; No Amendment Needed
To the Editor:
"Prayer in Public School? It's Nothing New for Many" (front page, Nov. 22) exaggerates the extent to which schools are defying the First Amendment's ban on governmental establishment of religion.
More disturbing, you lump impermissible activities with practices that are constitutionally tolerated and might also be constitutionally protected.


Out, Damned Spot!
Ray and Louise Barnes of Baltimore recognized that murder, suicide and other sudden deaths can leave a terrible mess.
So they set up Crime Scene Clean-Up Inc., a service specializing in getting out those damned spots, and marketed themselves to funeral directors, insurance companies and the police.
"Most cleaning services usually don't want to mess with anything having to do with a body," says Ray, a forensic investigator with the state of Maryland.
"But I'm used to it." Since May, the Barneses have scrubbed away the blood, other bodily fluids and odors of 30 of Baltimore's more untimely deaths.
Typically, the scene of a death takes about three hours to clean; cost, about $400.
The Barneses have fielded several calls from New Yorkers who want to set up franchises.


English Rentals
To the Editor: Following up on your article "In Cornwall, a Castle of One's Own" (Aug. 21), I wanted to add that for a number of years my husband and I have rented houses, cottages or flats through the National Trust in England.
It is the only way to go.
You unpack and get settled for a whole week and take day trips.
Each one we had was fascinating and perfect in every way.
Our favorite was a little place in Yorkshire.


Wall Street; Mothers-to-Be and High Fashion: They Don't Mix
IF your pregnant pals have been looking a little frumpy lately, it would come as little surprise to the sellers of high-fashion maternity clothes.
A Pea in the Pod, the Irving, Texas-based maternity retailer that operates 68 stores, said Wednesday that it would be closing ten stores over the next nine months, taking a one-time pretax charge of $1.25 million.
Net loss per share for the fourth fiscal quarter ended Oct. 23 was 12 cents, the company said, compared to a 4 cent gain in the same quarter the year before.
The stock tanked on the news, closing at 2 3/8 on Friday, down from $3 at Tuesday's close and $12 when Pea in the Pod went public in September 1993.
Pregnant women apparently aren't as anxious to deck out as maternity rag peddlers would like.
Mothers Work Inc. has been suffering similar setbacks.
News of layoffs and plunging earnings this fall sent the stock from $20 a share on Aug. 19 to $9.75 Friday.

Hesitant Norway to Vote on Europe
The meeting was billed as a discussion on whether Norway should join the European Union, but judging from the number of "no" buttons, most of those crowded into the tiny hall in rural Os this week had already made up their minds.
They listened politely while Ranveig Froyland, a member of Parliament, told them that they would be better off and their children's future more secure inside Europe.

F.Y.I.
The Legality of a Honk Q. Automobile horn blowing seems unnecessary in a city.
I believe it is prohibited in Paris, for example.
Is it against the law here?
A.
Now, don't panic.
But right now, all over the city, thousands of New York City residents are flouting the authority of Section 24-221a of the city's Noise Control Code: "No person shall operate or use or cause to be operated any claxon installed on a motor a vehicle except as a sound signal of imminent danger."
While losing your job for being late or suffering a nervous breakdown in midday traffic may fit many people's idea of "imminent danger," technically it still doesn't justify using your car horn.
But, luckily for cacophonous car owners, the city does not pursue offenders rigorously; generally, the Environmental Control Board levies fewer than 10 fines a year for car horn violations.
To register complaints about noise pollution, call the New York City Department of Environmental Protection's 24-hour complaint line, (718) DEP-HELP.
Sheriff Fetches Fines Q. I saw a white car marked Sheriff holding up traffic in Central Park.
Who is the New York City Sheriff, and what does he do?
A.
Despite its folksy moniker and long history, the New York City Sheriff has more to do with tow trucks than with gunfights.
Established in 1626, the Sheriff's office in Manhattan and its equivalents in the other boroughs served as a major part of the patchwork of law-enforcement agencies that existed before the city's consolidation in 1898.
After that, the new New York City Police Department took over the responsibility for criminal investigations and arrests.
As recently as 1942, the Sheriff was also responsible for manning and administering the city's jails, a duty now carried by the Department of Correction.
Today, the sheriff's primary duties are enforcing court-ordered judgments and fines, including unpaid parking tickets and littering fines, and collecting judgments from reluctant losers in private lawsuits, said John George, the Sheriff's executive assistant.
Sheriff's deputies, outfitted in dark blue uniforms and state-trooper style Stetsons, carry guns and can make arrests if they see a crime in action.
In recent years, the Sheriff's office, though small in comparison to the City Police Department, has been no stranger to attention.
The previous Sheriff, Philip A. Crimaldi, found himself in hot water with the City Council and city marshals (who also collect fees for the city) for his tough tactics with parking-ticket scofflaws, which included seizing their cars.
Some residents also accused Mr.
Crimaldi's deputies of using tactics reminiscent of the Old West, including brandishing weapons to collect unpaid fines.
Mr.
Crimaldi denied his deputies acted improperly.
But now there's a new Sheriff in town.
Kerry John Katsorhis, a Queens lawyer, was appointed on June 2 by Mayor Giuliani as the 108th Sheriff of New York City.
And as for weapons, Mr.
Katsorhis said shortly after his appointment that, frankly, he doesn't like guns.
But does he wear a star?
More Lawyers, by Far Q. My friend and I (he a litigious drone, I an artist) got into an argument that you might be able to settle.
Are there more lawyers or more actors in New York City?
A.
The drones have it.
As of Sept. 1, the State Office of Court Adminstration shows 63,823 registered lawyers doing business in New York City.
By comparison, actors seem practically scarce.
According to Alan Eisenberg, executive secretary of Actors Equity, the professional actors and stage managers union, there are about 16,000 professional actors registered with Equity in the New York City area.
This figure does not, however, include legions of nonunion actors or actors working only in film or television.
Though more lawyers means more competition, they can take solace in the fact that they're at least registered as "doing business"; the average weekly unemployment rate for Equity actors runs at about 83 percent.

Ban the Ban?
Call it chemical correctness.
The School of Social Work at the University of Minnesota has adopted a "scent-free policy" to protect three people who suffer from multiple chemical sensitivity.
There's no ban, but students are requested to, well, refrain from Ban.
"This is a medical mine field," says Claudia Miller, an allergist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.
Some small percentage of the population suffers from multiple chemical sensitivity.
Even a whiff of some chemicals can cause them cardiac and respiratory problems, memory loss and dizziness.
But Miller says rigorous double-blind testing needs to be done to establish the nature and causes of the condition.


Where Trite Is True, 'Hip' Rings Phony
IN EDNA FERBER'S BEST-SELLING 1926 NOVEL, "Show Boat," Magnolia, once the leading lady of the Cotton Blossom, boasts to her actress daughter about the good old days when the Mississippi was crowded with giant floating theaters: "In the audience strong men wept and women fainted." Her daughter, Kim, thinks that Magnolia's tastes are dated and that she may have spent too much time on the river for her own good.
"Now listen, Nola, darling," Kim says in the smart-set style of the 20's.
"One of your old-day gals would last about four seconds on Broadway. . . . If the sentimental old dears were to come back in an all-star revival today the intelligent modern theatergoing audience would walk out on them."
Well, as anyone can see by attending the latest revival of Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's 67-year-old musical based on the novel, strong men are indeed weeping as in Magnolia's day, and at least at the performance I attended, nobody showed any inclination to walk out on any sentimental old dears.
In fact, audiences at the Gershwin Theater are cheering, and even sober-minded critics more used to unamplified voices in grander-styled music dramas have been swept away in the musical currents.
What a difference from Leonard Bernstein's "Wonderful Town," which just finished its run at the New York City Opera; that musical may be three decades younger than "Show Boat," but it seems as creaky as a dilapidated steamship.
On its opening night earlier this month, many presumably intelligent modern theatergoers did just what Kim predicted.

New Tunnel Eases Trip: Toulouse to Barcelona
Crossing the Pyrenees between Toulouse, France, and Barcelona, Spain, has been made easier with the opening of the Tunnel du Puymorens last month.
The two-way tunnel took four years to complete and cost about $186 million.
Cars and trucks can now drive through the three-mile tunnel in five minutes, avoiding the 20-minute, twisting climb over the 1.2-mile mountain pass on a road that is often snowbound in winter.
The toll for cars is about $8 one way.
The tunnel, which is open 24 hours a day, all year round, is the fourth of its kind under the Pyrenees.


On Sunday; 'Old Sparky': It's Not Just A Punch Line
AT a time when David Letterman gets a pretty good laugh with references to the expected return of "Old Sparky," New York State's electric chair, Bob Gangi is not amused.
He quoted Churchill: "The mood and temper of the public in regard to the treatment of crime and criminals is one of the most unfailing tests of the civilization of any country."
If so, then the public temper of our civilization is clearly for more of Old Sparky.
And Mr.
Gangi, as executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, one of the nation's earliest do-good watchdog organizations, can only groan in the minority with his risque insistence that felons are human, whatever problems of disposal they present to law abiders.
Mr.
Gangi talks of "the ignorance of history and the thirst for retribution" ruining all attempts at political debate about crime and punishment in America.


Two Acts: 'Figaro/Figaro'
THE double bill at Yale Repertory is being called "Figaro/Figaro." Sans Rossini.
Sans Mozart.
And yet, it's not so much a double bill as a, well, marriage.
For the playwright Eric Overmyer has attempted a one-night fusion in two acts of the Beaumarchais classic "The Marriage of Figaro" (1776) and what will be inevitably perceived as a sequel of sardonic but contemporary logical consequence: "Figaro Gets a Divorce" (1937) by the Hungarian playwright Odon von Horvath. (Performances begin Thursday and run through Dec. 17 at the University Theater, 222 York Street, in New Haven; 432-1234).

I've lived in various cities where I had to gauge the level of danger in the areas where I chose to run.
And I have accepted that, as a woman, there is no safe place for me to run at night.
I hate that I can't listen to music while I run.
Yet, being raped is too high a price to pay to hear a good beat while I sweat.
Night is a glorious time to be outside and work out, but I would rather rework my schedule than end up a statistic.

New Captain Alters Buildings Department's Course
PROFESSIONALS in construction and allied fields who have been forced to deal with a Buildings Department buried in the administration of the city's burgeoning rules for 25 years may be pardoned for skepticism when talk turns yet again to reform.
But in 10 months as Buildings Commissioner, Joel A. Miele, a civil engineer and former City Planning Commissioner from Queens, has left no doubt that change is afoot.
From a staffing standpoint, a reduction has already begun.
Marching to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's downsizing drum, the staff has already shrunk 22 percent -- to 595 employees from 758.

Woodall Wakes Up and Finds It's True: He's Really a 49er
If he stopped to think about where he came from and where he is now, Lee Woodall's head would probably spin off his shoulders.
How often does a football player from a small Division II school, who played three positions in college and flunked out of school for a year, come to be drafted in the next-to-last round and wind up starting at linebacker for a Super Bowl contender?
But that's exactly how things happened for Woodall, a rookie the 49ers drafted in the sixth round out of West Chester University, a Division II college outside of Philadelphia where the Eagles hold training camp.
He is the right outside linebacker for the 49ers, who play New Orleans on Monday night for a chance to clinch the National Football Conference West division.


Phoning Home
To the Editor: And then there's the phone company that has pay phones installed in the Portsmouth Abbey school in Rhode Island.
A company called Operator Assistance Network has its name on top of the bills, but the company is called American Telecom.
All Elderhostelers called home at least once from this private school in August.
Bet that was our biggest learning experience.


The Nation; New Economy Dashes Old Notions of Growth
EVERYWHERE, companies are telling the same sort of story, whose message is this: The American economy may be capable of generating more production and prosperity -- without inflation -- than either the statistics or conventional theory acknowledge.
Chase Manhattan Bank in New York is one of the storytellers.
It once had 100 data-processing centers in Europe and the United States.
There are two now, in New York and London, that turn out more work than all 100, with far fewer people, says Craig D. Goldman, Chase's chief technology officer.
If the New York center is overloaded, work is shifted to London, where the computers are idle during Europe's nighttime.
"When we need extra capacity, we can get it rapidly overseas," Mr.
Goldman said.
From 6 Seconds to 3
The Eaton Corporation's factory in Kearney, Neb., which manufactures engine valves for auto companies, also stretches production and capacity in ways the Government doesn't measure.
For Stephen R. Hardis, Eaton's vice chairman, "capacity is a very fluid kind of thing that keeps growing." Each month, Eaton gets a little more production with the same number of workers.
The packing of valves in boxes was automated recently, and the chrome-plating process was redesigned so that each valve is plated now in three seconds instead of six.

Why Women Remain At the Back of the Bus
CARNEGIE HALL'S "WOMEN IN Jazz" concert on Thursday is one of those fine ideas, part marketing and part do-goodism, that inadvertantly underscores a deep and rarely registered problem in jazz.
The concert, which is meant to give an overview of women's contribution to jazz, will feature the music of historical figures like Mary Lou Williams along with the music of and performances by Melba Liston, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Carla Bley and Maria Schneider.
It will allow some of the better female arrangers and improvisers working in jazz to display their wares before a large audience.
Taken as a group, they yet again make the case that women can and do play the music well.
Two things are disturbing about the concert.
In its packaging, the concert implies that women need special ways of being marketed, a kind of Women's Night, suggesting that musicians, promoters and audiences haven't supported women enough.
More insidious is the lingering perception of women as anomalies in jazz.
The Carnegie Hall program is nothing less than the continued, systematic ghettoization of female performers and begs the most obvious question of all.
If these women are good enough to be featured on stage together and audiences are charged up to $55 to hear them, why aren't they good enough to appear regularly in the presence of their male peers with no reference made to their sex?


Chinese Cheetos

It's All in Boomer's Hands; Jets' Quarterback Is Pitching Leadership and Responsibility
Through all the championship games Boomer Esiason has played in, there was only one that his father, Norman, worried about.
It occurred years ago at East Islip High School on Long Island, and it involved baseball, not football.
With East Islip up by a run over Connetquot in extra innings and a division title at stake, young Norman (Boomer) Esiason was summoned from first base to take over the pitching chores for the final three outs.


Technology; Coast-to-Coast Radio Without Squawk or Fade
IMAGINE dozens of channels of CD-quality music of every conceivable genre, plus dozens more offering talking books and foreign language services -- all at the touch of a car radio button.
Imagine that the crystal-clear signal would be available anywhere in North America, broadcast from a satellite.
If CD Radio Inc. or any of the three other companies designing the systems have their way, such signals may start beaming earthward as early as 1998.


An Embassy Job in Moscow Would Make Any American Testy; Rudeness in Budapest
To the Editor:
While living and working in Budapest for the Soros Foundation for the last year, I had numerous occasions to visit the United States Embassy (news article, Nov. 18).
Virtually every time, I was struck by the insensitivity of United States personnel.
I witnessed verbal abuse of non-Americans and a general attitude of disdain, disrespect and indifference.


Q. &amp; A.
A Leak From the Unit Above Q I have owned a co-op in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn since 1988.
During this time I have had several problems with leaks from the apartment above into my bathroom and bedroom.

After inspecting my apartment, they notified the building's co-op board of the situation.
Damage from the leak has made my bathroom unsafe, unsanitary and unsightly.

It's too much to stomach in the National Football League: just ask John Elway.

The World -- The New Trade Treaty; A Quick Ramble in a Thicket of Rules
IT'S a scary thing, this GATT, if only because its name sounds so unfriendly and its details are so obscure.
The treaty sets new rules for international commerce by revising the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
It is so enormous that President Clinton needed 4,004 pages to explain to Congress what he was asking it to pass, with no amendments allowed.
The number of people who have read, and understood, all those pages is no doubt small.

Raising a Chimp in a Suburban Setting
THE experiment was a great success, but all the participants were devasted, and the subject died soon afterward.
When an ambitious scientist diverges from his customary objectivity and loses his way in a jungle of human emotions the repercussions are profound for himself and his family.
"A matter of love" is how Jane Orttung today describes the preternatural relationship between her father, the explorer and mammologist Henry Raven, and her sometimes "sister" Meshie, who would obey no one else but him.
This singular child, as loved and loving as any other growing to adolescence in the Long Island suburbs, rode tricycles and a kiddie car, played with the neighborhood children, indulged at ice-cream parties, went sledding and splashed about in a backyard pool.
Meshie, however, was anything but a regular child; she was a chimpanzee.


After Years of Talk, Trade Pact Now Awaits Congressional Fate
It may be the most confounding acronym in American foreign policy: GATT, shorthand for a vast international trade agreement that has been negotiated for so long that the founder of one of the world's great trading centers, Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, once called it the General Agreement to Talk and Talk.
In the coming week, the talking about the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will yield to decision-making.
Congress, meeting in a lame-duck session that initially threatened to be the setting of the first power struggle between the Clinton Administration and a Republican opposition that will be in the Capitol Hill majority come January, is to vote up or down on a sweeping, 124-nation overhaul of GATT.


Lost in Yonkers? An Olds Option Could Be a Guide
TIRED of trying to unfold, read and refold road maps in heavy traffic while looking for an unfamiliar location?
Oldsmobile is offering navigational help for buyers of 1995 Eighty Eight models in the form of Guidestar, a computerized system that calculates the most efficient route to a destination and provides visual and audio information on how to get there.
The help does not come cheap.
Guidestar is currently a $1,995 dealer-installed option in California, the only place where the highway data base is sufficiently complete to permit full operation of the system.
Olds plans to introduce Guidestar next month in the Michigan-Illinois-Indiana region, and coverage of the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut-Rhode Island area is expected by early 1995.
All of the United States is due for inclusion by the first quarter of 1996.


From Photographer to Historian
In 1958, Jacques Lowe was a fairly inexperienced 26-year-old photographer when he met the young Senator John F. Kennedy, and almost without realizing it found himself a member of a campaign in those early days when few people bothered to turn out for Kennedy appearances.
Only slowly, he recalls, did he come to realize that "we" were running for President.
The 1960 election won, J.F.K. asked Lowe to stick around and record his Administration.
Given carte blanche to roam the White House, Mr.
Lowe amassed, in the end, some 40,000 negatives of the Camelot years, what he calls "the most complete photographic record of any Administration in American history" in his selection of these shots, JFK REMEMBERED (Random House, $37.50).
His commentary, witty and just a bit offbeat, accompanies stunning photographs, some familiar, some never before published.
Mr.
Lowe lends a new dimension to some of the era's most historic moments: the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Bay of Pigs discussions, the Paris meeting with Charles de Gaulle when the French leader used every ruse to keep the photographer away, the Khrushchev summit in Vienna with the Russian leader totally charmed by Mrs.
Kennedy while the President looked miserable with Mrs.
Khrushchev.
Always at Kennedy's heels, the photographer was inevitably drawn into the private moments; the President insisted that Mr.
Lowe take pictures of his daughter, Caroline, knowing that her mother did not want the children photographed.
We have finally a personal retrospective on Kennedy history, private and public.
In his foreword, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. writes that he recognized in Lowe a fellow historian "with a passion to record actualities -- not to reconstruct for the sake of a prettier photograph." LYNN KARPEN


Zurich
Zurich's lucrative function as one of the world's financial crossroads may suggest it is nothing more than a place for nursing numerous anonymous bank accounts.
Yet this rich city of 360,000 residents boasts great cultural wealth as well: an ambitious opera house, many concerts and interesting theater.
Its Kunsthaus is internationally renowned, principally as a trove of modern art, and a score of other museums also deserve visits.

Racing Stripes at the Ready


Josh White Liked It, Too
To the Editor:
Eric Weisbard's discussion of the folk song variously called "In the Pines," "Where Did You Sleep Last Night?" and "Black Girl"  [ "A Simple Song That Lives Beyond Time," Nov. 13 ]  omitted an important contributor to the song's endurance.
The folk singer and guitarist Josh White established a career as a cabaret performer well before the popular folk revival inspired by Pete Seeger and the Weavers.
White's rendition of "Black Girl" gained far more notice than any of the other early versions.
Playing on the song's theme of duplicity, White infused it with heavy irony and adopted it as a signature song.

Facile Versifying
To the Editor:
Regarding Linda Gregerson's review of John Ashbery's "And the Stars Were Shining (Oct. 23): Again we are treated to panegyrics -- "national treasure," "part of a larger provisionality," etc., etc. This championing of Mr. Ashbery -- a facile versifier at best and an overrated verbal meanderer at worst -- is simply unsupportable. Why isn't it obvious that this writer writes the equivalent of cotton candy? Bite, swallow and there's nothing there.
Having read Mr.
Ashbery and having come to the aforementioned candy conclusion, I thought that listening to him read his own work would show me what I was missing, and as director of the International Poetry Forum I invited him to Pittsburgh some years ago.
Mr.
Ashbery in person gave me the same impression as he did on the page.
Here was seemingly sophisticated dullness raised to new heights.
Why then this cavalcade of praise for such an opaque writer when there are poets like Galway Kinnell, W. S. Merwin, Mona Van Duyn, Linda Pastan, Hayden Carruth, Derek Walcott, Seamus Heaney, Barton Sutter, Brendan Galvin, Peter Makuck, Philip Levine, Charles Causely, Philip Booth, Miller Williams and Naomi Shihav Nye -- writers of genuine talent and vision with something to say -- unignorably among us?
I have heard Mr.
Ashbery's prominence attributed to everything from another example of the tale of the emperor's new clothes to the influence of a friendly cabal on the East Coast.
Who knows and who cares?
The result is that we have pseudo-poetry passed off as the real thing.

CONNECTICUT GUIDE
CONSIDERING SUBURBIA
Connecticut's suburbs and the towns that have become or are becoming suburbs with the spread of development will be the subject of a conference called "Between City and Country: Preservation and the Suburbs," to be held by the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation on Wednesday in Waterbury.
This will be the first time that the suburbs have been considered by the trust as a focus for preservation.
Examination of the issue has revealed concern for the loss of many small town Main Street environments and the construction of megastores in rural areas where they tend to alter the character of the landscape.


A 19-Year-Old Carries the Hopes of a Culture
The promoter Julio Pabon would like to sign Felipe Lopez to a contract with his company, Latino Sports.
Coach Brian Mahoney would like Lopez to lift him from coach class to first class.
And the scout Jim Thomas would like to squint through the Lopez limelight to spot something about one of his St.
John's teammates that might someday help the Toronto Raptors.
It is far too early in the season to cast Pabon, Mahoney and Thomas as three wise men bringing gifts to a child who will save them or as the protagonists in the Chaucerian tale of three robbers finding treasure.
But the saga has clearly begun, and in a time when multiculturalism and shoe dreams are scrambling under the same hoop, it is a saga worth following, especially when the subject has a Magic Johnson smile and is willing to declare himself a role model.


HOW I GAVE UP MY ALIAS
Her 26-year marriage ends in divorce and the issue of dropping her married name "overshadowed all others"?
Personally, I would have thought that other things -- the effect of the divorce on her daughters, her own financial security, the prospect of life alone or with another partner -- would have loomed somewhat larger.
When will women stop exaggerating the importance of superficial issues?

Laurie B. Milder, Robert Firestone
Laurie Beth Milder, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.

The bride is the special counsel to the New York City Bar Association.
She graduated from Brooklyn College and received her law degree from Yeshiva University.
Her father is a cardiologist at the Sephardic Home for the Aged in Brooklyn and a clinical assistant professor of medicine at the State University Health Science Center at Brooklyn.
Her mother, Hilda Milder, is a painter and poet.


Lopez Gets A's for His Second Effort
Contrary to published reports, the Felipe Lopez era at St.
John's didn't begin with Friday night's season-opening victory over Dartmouth.
That was just a bad warm-up act.
The first real Lopez sighting worth remembering actually occurred with 15 minutes 47 seconds left in the second half of yesterday's championship game of the 20th annual Joe Lapchick Tournament.
That's when Lopez brought a sold-out crowd at Alumni Hall to its feet by displaying the first true evidence of a mega-talent ready to explode.


BENNINGTON MEANS BUSINESS
While I understand your reasons for choosing the cover photo depicting four spike-wearing, cigarette-smoking students, dyed hair blowing in the breeze, apparently beamed up to Vermont from Avenue A, I believe that you have done a disservice to the Bennington College community by visually misrepresenting us.
And your cover line, "Reality Bites," is the title of a mediocre film that portrays my generation as a trendy, unimaginative, lazy and consumeristic lot who are interested only in sponging off our parents, watching television and smoking -- hardly an accurate description of Bennington students.

UNDER MY SKIN: Volume One of My Autobiography, to 1949, by Doris Lessing. (HarperCollins, $25.) A remarkable life in Britain's declining African empire, told by a novelist who has never conceded anything to political, psychological or literary fashion.


How He Kept 'Em in Stitches
AT THE HEIGHT OF Richard Pryor's fame in the late 1970's, he was the undisputed king of stand-up comedy.
Considered a genius by many, he was recognized for his brilliance even by those who were offended by the content and candor of much of his material.
But his near death by fire, his several heart attacks and the gradually disabling effects of multiple sclerosis have almost ended his career as an active comic performer.
In his absence since the early 80's, some outstanding black comedians have emerged.
Eddie Murphy, Whoopi Goldberg and, more recently, Martin Lawrence top the list of those who dominate the field.
Others, like Damon and Keenen Ivory Wayans, Sinbad, Marcia Warfield, George Wallace, Robin Harris and the up-and-coming Dave Chappelle and Paul Mooney, have also carved out respectable niches as comedians.
And, of course, the legendary and indefatigable Bill Cosby remains a formidable comic presence, largely through his popular television series "The Cosby Show," which is now in syndication.


Danya M. Rogers, Evan S. Cohan
Danya Merrill Rogers, the daughter of Lydia S. Rogers Freifeld of Nyack, N.Y., and Bruce A. Rogers of Grandview, N.Y., was married on Wednesday to Evan Scott Cohan, the son of Charlotte D. Cohan of New City, N.Y., and the late Albert I. Cohan.
Rabbi David E. Fass officiated at the Essex House in New York.
Mrs.
Cohan, 28, is an area sales manager in Port Washington, L.I., for Hoffman-LaRoche Inc., the pharmaceuticals manufacturer.
She graduated from the State University at Buffalo and is studying for a master's degree in psychology at Hunter College.


When Shaped Like a Basketball, the World Is Her Oyster
As girls' basketball has changed, so have the girls themselves.
In the 1950's, girls' basketball was like a hand-cranked silent movie.
Very slow and very jerky.
A girl dribbled twice, and then stopped, looking around like a frightened deer.
If someone ran toward her, she dropped the ball.


New High School Is a Study in Green
From the composting of cafeteria waste in the basement to the roofing made of recycled tires, the High School for Environmental Studies is living up to its name.
The school, which started at the old Stuyvesant High in 1992, moved this fall to its permanent home in a three-building complex at 444 West 56th Street.
Practicing what it teaches, the school set an earth-friendly example in designing the $23 million renovation of the buildings, formerly a 20th Century Fox studio and headquarters.


Park Slope Experiment Takes Recycling to Its Outer Limits
How much trash are New Yorkers capable of recycling?
If the experience of about 6,000 families in Park Slope, Brooklyn, is any indication, there is virtually no limit.


Marni P. Stiftel, Jonathan Frankel
Marni Paula Stiftel, a daughter of Fredrick and Helaine Stiftel of Wayside, N.J. was married last evening to Jonathan Joshua Frankel, the son of Eric and Lynn Frankel of Ocean, N.J.
Rabbi Jacob Friedman performed the ceremony at the St.
Regis in New York.
Mrs.
Frankel, 25, is a budget analyst for the District of Columbia.
She graduated cum laude from Bryn Mawr College and received a master's degree in public policy from Georgetown University.
Her parents own Walton Management Serices, a management consulting concern in Ocean.

The World; Who Can Save Arafat? Arafat.
YASIR ARAFAT is in trouble.
Yes, you've heard that Jeremiad before.
But this time there is a twist.
In the past, somebody else always saved Mr.
Arafat when he was tottering on the brink -- the Russians, the Saudis, the Lebanese Muslims, the Jews, the United Nations, the world media, or simply Lady Luck.
But this time things are different, because this time the only one who can save Mr.
Arafat is himself.
A lot of governments are now asking what they can do to rescue Mr.
Arafat, and they will be meeting in Brussels next week to discuss just that.
No doubt, the Israelis can help him.
The United States, the Europeans and the World Bank, too.
And they will have to help.


At Work; A Plan Even Democrats Could Love
THINK "harmonic convergence" and what images materialize?
Mount Shasta at dawn perhaps.
Druids and Californians in saffron robes humming the Windham Hill backlist.
Imaginative would be the person who immediately thought, "Ah, employment policy, ah, enlightenment."
Yet scholarship and the Zeitgeist did converge recently in the Republican landslide and the near simultaneous publication of a proposal to overhaul workplace law, leaving two bemused policy experts unexpectedly enjoying a world-historical moment.
They are Edward E. Potter and Judith A. Youngman, authors of "Keeping America Competitive: Employment Policy for the 21st Century" (Glenbridge Publishing, $27.95), a compendious excursion through employment law that was surely destined only for the seminar tables of policy Washington until the people spoke on Nov. 8.


Pro-Russia Rebels Enter Chechyna Capital
The civil war in the secessionist Russian republic of Chechnya intensified today as rebels seeking to overthrow the Government entered the capital city and attacked the presidential palace with tanks.
There were conflicting reports on the extent of the rebels' advance.
Both the Government and the opposition claimed to be in control of the Government's headquarters.


Jill A. Freeberg, James M. Gartenberg
Jill Ann Freeberg, the daughter of Frank and Ferne Freeberg of Melville, L.I., was married last evening to James Michael Gartenberg, the son of Irving and Lois Gartenberg of New York.
Rabbi David M. Posner officiated at the Tam O'Shanter Golf Club in Brookville, L.I.


The Widow Gets Her Verdict
ON LABOR DAY MORNING, Myrlie Evers, 61, widow of Medgar Evers, the slain civil rights legend, stood on a platform in Jackson, Miss., and cut ribbons dedicating the Medgar Wiley Evers Post Office Building.
A church choir sang "He's So Wonderful." Mississippi politicians, black and white, made speeches.
Two blocks away, Byron De La Beckwith, 73, who was convicted in February of the Evers murder in 1963, sat at the Hinds County Detention Center.
"I chuckled at the thought that the jail was so close," Myrlie Evers said after the festivities.
She is a handsome woman, tall, with a spark in her chestnut eyes.
"I hope he heard everything," she went on.
"I want him to understand how much he's motivated me all this time."
The journey that brought Myrlie Evers to this sweet moment of justice took her 31 years to complete.
In June 1963, her husband, the field secretary of the Mississippi N.A.A.C.P., was gunned down in front of the family home in Jackson.
The killing was among the first of that decade's political assassinations and a turning point in the civil rights movement.
President John Kennedy dedicated his ground-breaking civil rights legislation to Evers's memory.
Within days of the funeral, Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist, was charged for the first time with the murder.
He was tried twice in 1964; both times, all-white juries deadlocked, creating mistrials.
Though strong evidence linked Beckwith to the killing, and though he himself dropped hints of involvement, the Hinds County prosecutor eventually dismissed the murder charges.


For Giants and Skins, Something's Not Right
Giants-Redskins was once one of the most heated rivalries in football.
Joe Gibbs and Bill Parcells were roaming the sidelines.
John Riggins was playing behind the Hogs.
Lawrence Taylor sent Joe Theismann's life into an entirely different direction with a crushing hit.
John Madden would roll up in his cruiser to the stadium and help broadcast the game.
Now, Madden would probably just as soon take the bus to a Washington Bullets game and watch Chris Webber dunk a basketball than go to today's Giants-Redskins clash at R.F.K.
Stadium.


Sound Bytes; Sybase's Quiet, Steady Hand
IN the software industry, where flamboyant chief executives like Bill Gates of Microsoft and Larry Ellison of Oracle garner much of the attention, Mark Hoffman has studiously avoided the limelight.
The quiet and unassuming West Point graduate and former triathlete has nonetheless built one of the fastest-growing software companies in the world as chairman and chief executive of Sybase Inc., an Emeryville, Calif. data base software maker.
With the acquisition this month of Powersoft, the leading client-server application development tool company, Sybase became the seventh-largest software company in the world, with revenues expected to surpass $1 billion in 1995.
Mr.
Hoffman, who engineered the $940 million deal, cofounded Sybase in 1984 (with Robert Epstein) after brief stints at Amdahl and Britton-Lee.


Three Patients Are Missing After Escapes at Psychiatric Hospital
Two patients at the Kingsboro State Psychiatric Center in Brooklyn escaped through an unlocked ward door on Friday, state officials said yesterday, and four others failed to return after spending Thanksgiving Day with their families on day passes.
Three of the six were still unaccounted for yesterday afternoon, said Robert Spoor, a spokesman for the State Department of Mental Health, including a man who was being held involuntarily for observation after a sexual assault charge.


Bruce L. Campbell, Cannon L. Quigley
Cannon Louise Quigley, a daughter of Lynn and Leonard V. Quigley of Forest Hills, Queens, was married yesterday to Bruce Loren Campbell, the son of Rilla and Larry E. Campbell of Riverside, Calif.
The Rev.
Edward Scharfenberger performed the Roman Catholic ceremony at the Church of St.
Vincent Ferrer in New York.
Mr. and Mrs.
Campbell, both 27, received their law degrees from Harvard University and are associates in the law firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers, she in Los Angeles and he in Newport Beach, Calif.
The bride graduated from Stanford University, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
The bridegroom graduated cum laude from Princeton University.


Fall Cleaning for a Better Spring Show
IT'S time.
Cleanup of the garden should be well under way.
End-of-the-season tending helps make the spring garden spectacular.
All those reminders of the previous year will be gone.
The bulbs, trees and early wildflowers can have the scene all to themselves.
A proper fall season tidy-up also reduces wintering hideouts for many insects, which like to snuggle down in garden debris.
Some insects also lay their eggs in plant detritus and removal of it makes their reappearance less likely.


A Fuel Tank In Projects Raises Fears
For six months, a fuel tank has sat outside the Bland Houses.
Over the summer, said residents at the Flushing housing project, children climbed atop the 13-foot-high tank and, after prying open a trapdoor and soaking rags inside, they coated one building's lobby with oil.
Last week, one of the tank's pipes broke and spewed oil for several hours before it was repaired.
Many residents believe the latest incident was caused by vandalism, said George Gardner, who has lived for 27 years in the project.
And now the onset of winter has raised residents' fears that freezing temperatures will burst more pipes, endangering passersby and leaving hundreds of apartments without heat or hot water.


Jet Evacuated After a Threat
Forty-two passengers were evacuated from a Delta Air Lines jet at La Guardia Airport yesterday after officials received a bomb threat from a caller who identified the flight by number, a Port Authority official said.
The passengers were taken off the plane, flight 792, and asked to claim their luggage at about 7:45 P.M., said Gwen Williams, a Port Authority spokeswoman.


'The Size of the World,' By a New Playwright
THE Penguin Rep, the gutsiest little theater just north of New Jersey, is wrapping up its 17th season with a new play, "The Size of the World," by a new playwright, Chuck Evered.
Having primed a loyal audience for the risks and rewards of what might be called potluck theater, Joe Brancato, the artistic director, keeps on presenting plays that nobody -- well, hardly anybody -- has ever heard of.
Except for a random anomaly like "Love Letters," which opened the season with alternating performers.


Nov. 20-26: A Revolution Stalls; Berlusconi Is in Trouble, Politically and Otherwise, And So Is His Country
Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, the tycoon-turned-politician who promised his land a revolution of prosperity and clean dealing, is in trouble.
Last week, only eight months after the won power as the harbinger of a new Italy, the country's crusading magistrates told him that he was under investigation for corruption.
And this week, unless he is able to reach some last-minute compromise, the labor unions are threatening a general strike to protest budget cuts, further underscoring the difficulties of beating Italy's debt-ridden economy into any kind of shape.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
On the Open 'Road'
THOSE who like to put their pedals to the metal will appreciate how Stuart Hayim of Kings Point spends his spare time.
Imagine, he says, finding a piece of open road on Long Island. (Imagining may be the only way to accomplish that feat.)
As you start to speed, you're surrounded by 50 other drivers doing the same.
And every five seconds the cars hit giant speed bumps.
"All you can do is steer," he said, "while your passenger keeps the gas pedal to the floor."


Nov. 20-26: New Missions in Mind; Reservists and Guardsmen May Get Bigger Roles
One weekend a month and two weeks a year, often at the local armory.
That's what the annual drill routine has been for the one million members of the National Guard and Reserves.
But under a plan approved by Defense Secretary William J. Perry and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, many of the nation's weekend warriors would serve in several peacetime jobs now performed by active-duty forces.


Nov. 20-26; 80 Years Old? Say It Ain't So, Joe!
The words in the song voice this yearning: "Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio, a nation turns its lonely eyes to you."
We know the answer to the first: Joe in fact is here, still with us, because on Friday he celebrated his 80th birthday.
But while he has not played a baseball game in 43 years, the nation still turns its lonely eyes to him, or to what he symbolizes: excellence, elegance, goodness and, to be sure, gentleness.


World Markets; Eastern Europe as a Reasonable Risk
A YEAR ago investing in Eastern Europe was the craze.
A flood of foreign capital moved into these emerging free-market economies and pushed stocks to euphoric levels.
Poland's stock market, for example, rose more than 800 percent in 1993.
Hungary's market was up 200 percent in February of this year over a year earlier.
Then reality set in, with rising interest rates, profit taking and a flight of capital from these risky, barely regulated markets.
Since March investors have seen values plunge.
Hungarian stocks are off 30 percent.
Polish shares are down 57 percent from their March peaks, and the Czech stock market index has lost 35 percent.


Everglades Now Suffers Water Excess
Duane Osceola stood on the reservation dock here, boot deep in water, as he prepared to launch an airboat into the Everglades.
"Not all my life I haven't seen this much water," said Mr.
Osceola, a 20-year-old Seminole who is a land surveyor for the Miccosukee tribe.


Getting Angles
To the Sports Editor:
Being a motor racing fan, I have found it difficult at times during the Formula One season to find timely reports.
Joseph Siano's articles the last two weeks have not only been timely but they offered an interesting angle: contrasting Michael Schumacher's successful bid for the championship despite penalties and suspensions with Damon Hill in close pursuit of his father's legend.

From Art Deco Chrome to Indian Eatery
EVIDENCE of the organic changes that occur in a city is the metamorphosis of the Elm City Diner, a longtime New Haven landmark, into an Indian restaurant called Tandoor.
Everything that endeared the downtown site to Art Deco fans is still in place: the gleaming chrome and glass interior, the booths (now covered with pink tablecloths and Indian designs under glass) and the diner configuration.


SERVICE WITH A SNEER
I read with disgust your article about the discrimination encountered by many black Americans at various Denny's restaurants.
But I have to admit to mixed emotions when defending their "right" to be served the kind of fat-and-cholesterol-laden platter depicted on your cover.
To eat such a meal is to pay dearly indeed for the right to be served.
Our minds don't necessarily conform to "The Bell Curve." Our bodies shouldn't either.

Nov. 20-26; Amber Tsunamis of Grain


Happy Hanukkah? A Guide for the Perplexed.
HANUKKAH begins tonight at sundown.
It almost slipped past me this year, so soon after Turkey Day, almost a month before Gift Day.
Even when the calendar isn't playing tricks, Hanukkah is confusing, one of those holidays that tend to induce a spot of seasonal existential angst in secularized New York Jews.
I called my kids.
They refused to be interviewed.
Then could I at least say, I said, that this was their way of loading on new guilt for old gelt?
One of them said I couldn't even say that until she had her own major media outlet in which to reply.


Nov. 20-26; Paying Germans to Have Germans
Many experts believe that over-population is one of the greatest threats facing humanity and the earth on which we live.
Governments around the world are seeking ways to stop population explosions that threaten to overwhelm their economies and social structures.
Germans, however, have precisely the opposite concern.
Women have all but stopped having children, especially in states carved from the former East Germany.
The birth rate in Brandenburg has fallen by more than two-thirds since 1989 -- the state had 38,000 births that year, 12,000 last year -- and the drops in other eastern German states are almost as dramatic.

Nice Knees
As the advertisements for the Hospital for Special Surgery show, you can have surgery and still be sexy.
Real patients posed for the striking series of three print ads, each of which shows a joint that was reconstructed this year at the hospital in Manhattan.
The two women (the one with the knee is in her late 30's and the one with the hip in her mid 40's) are attractive enough to be good advertisements for cosmetic surgery.
The man in his mid 60's looks so-so.
Why is a hospital that specializes in orthopedic surgery running sexy ads?
Kathleen McGovern, director of marketing, says the market is "more competitive" than ever, although the sexiness was unintended.


Camp in Northern Minnesota a Haven for the Deer Hunter
Orion's belt was low in the southwest when I awakened a few hours before dawn and wandered outside, barefoot on the frost-covered stubble surrounding our deer camp.
Back inside, I debated whether to lie back down for the half hour that remained before all hands would be stirring.
Being somewhat past the age when one vibrates with excitement on the opening day of the hunting season, I chose the sack.
"Camp" is something of a misnomer for the establishment in which my companions and I spent a week in this thinly-populated section of northern Minnesota.
A large house trailer owned by David Tilton of Rye, N.H., and located in a field beside a small river, our accommodation can sleep nine in a pinch and has a full range of gas and electrical appliances, including a gas furnace and a microwave oven.
Water is toted in jerry cans from an ever-flowing artesian well 60 yards away, and the oversized and heated outhouse is equipped with a warm-water shower.


Spain's Olive Growers Seek Their Day in the Sun - in the U.S.
THIS provincial Spanish town, snug at the base of a mountaintop medieval castle, likes to think of itself as the Riyadh of olive oil.
Fields hereabouts that the Spanish poet Antonio Machado once described as "a sea of olive trees" -- there are 52 million of them, spread over 1.2 million acres -- yield fully 22 percent of the world's olive oil.
So Jaen's olive growers cannot understand why they are being pushed around by the likes of France, Italy and Greece.


It Costs Taxpayers Plenty to Police the World
To the Editor:
"Taxpayers Are Angry" (Week in Review, Nov. 20), on why major budget cuts cannot be made without hitting the middle class, omits a large issue.
The Defense Department budget is some $250 billion this year, down perhaps 15 to 20 percent.


Correction
An article on Oct. 30 about living in Florham Park, N.J., referred incorrectly to the tax status of property used by the Sisters of Charity of St.
Elizabeth.
The religious order pays taxes on part of the property used by the College of St.
Elizabeth and the Academy of St.
Elizabeth.

From Diversity Come Struggles
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT EVERYONE who is not an American Indian is an immigrant or the descendant of one, so it can scarcely be denied that this country has been immeasurably enriched by the diverse groups of people that have populated it.
Think of the artists who have been immigrants: Albert Bierstadt, Thomas Cole, Arshile Gorky, Willem de Kooning and Louise Bourgeois, among others, and among photographers, Timothy O'Sullivan, Eadweard Muybridge, Jacob Riis (who was so poor at one point that he lived on the street), Robert Frank.
These few came from the acceptable places -- Great Britain, northern and central Europe (although Gorky, an Armenian, barely qualified) -- and made their way up mainstream paths.

The bride, 28, is a physical therapist at Healthwest Regional Medical Center in Phoenix.
She received bachelor's degrees from the State University at Binghamton, N.Y., and New York University.


HOW TO GET A MAN PREGNANT
LAST WEDNESDAY, "JUNIOR," THE NEW MOVIE STARRING Arnold Schwarzenegger, opened in theaters around the country.
The film centers on the experiences of Dr.
Alex Hesse (played by Schwarzenegger), a scientist who has developed a wonder drug, called Expectane, that insures healthy pregnancies.
The crux of the movie is that when Hesse loses financing for his research, he has a fertilized egg implanted in his body, takes his own wonder drug and becomes pregnant.
From a scientific point of view, the plot of "Junior" is preposterous.
You don't need a science-fiction drug.
You may not need any kind of drug at all.
We have all the technology we need right now to make a man pregnant.
In fact, we had it all nine years ago, and we almost used it.
MY ADVENTURE IN MALE PREGNANCY BEGAN WITH A KINSEY INSTITUTE symposium in 1984.
At that meeting, John Money, a professor of medical psychology and pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University, and Roger Gorski, a professor of anatomy and cell biology at U.C.L.A.
Medical School, discussed technology that was already in place to create in a man the hormonal milieu of a pregnant woman.
I joined forces with another writer, Kathleen McAuliffe, and we researched and wrote an article that ran in Omni magazine, the gist of which was that there was no insurmountable biological or technical barrier to a man carrying a baby to term.


The Devil Is Tough, But Cigar Is Tougher
Devil His Due gave his farewell performance in his typical, driving way when he ran the 38th and final race of his career yesterday at Aqueduct.
But he was upstaged by a long shot named Cigar, who not only outran the great son of Devil's Bag but also beat him by seven lengths in the N.Y.R.A.
Mile.
Cigar?
On a track filled with star older horses, he buried them all: the Devil, who ran second; American Chance, fourth; Brunswick, fifth; Itaka, seventh; Storm Tower, eighth; Bertrando, 10th, and Harlan, 11th.
It was only the second time in 15 months that Cigar had made the winner's circle, and only the third time in his career.
But after he was switched from grass racing to the dirt last month, he won an allowance race by eight lengths and he came back to beat some big ones yesterday by seven.


Phoning Home
To the Editor: This summer I called Rhode Island directory assistance twice from a pay phone at Crane Beach, Mass., north of Boston.
The Oncor phone company charged me approximately $10 for these two calls.
Shocked at this amount, I checked with the Trustees of Reservations, the nonprofit group that operates the beach, a group for which I have great respect.
Peter J. Pinciaro, the superintendent of the beach, responded that the long-distance carrier at the beach phones had always been AT&amp;T.
After my letter, Mr.
Pinciaro wrote, he called his AT&amp;T representative and learned that AT&amp;T had received a computer-generated communication from Oncor shifting long-distance service at the beach to Oncor.
Mr.
Pinciaro said this did not have his approval and Crane Beach was switched back to AT&amp;T on Sept. 15, he wrote.


Sports of The Times; In College Basketball, The Mind Games Begin
JOHN CALIPARI has a theory, which he telegraphs with a wink and a smile, just in case you're a little slow.
When you open your season against the defending national champions, it's only a big game if. . . .
But let his players tell you.
"What do I always say?" Calipari asked a trio of his University of Massachusetts players late Friday.
"It's only a big game if. . . .' "


Resorts Revamped On Paradise Island
The piece of Paradise Island in the Bahamas that once belonged to Merv Griffin -- about 80 percent of the hilly, 826-acre island, -- has undergone dramatic changes since it, along with three resorts, was purchased last May by Sol Kerzner, who built the Sun City complex in South Africa.
Next month two of the properties are scheduled to officially open, following extensive refurbishments.
The former Paradise Island Resort and Casino, renamed Atlantis, Paradise Island, is scheduled to open fully on Dec. 22.
The resort has been partly closed since last May when its $125 million refurbishment began.
The property will include a 14-acre water park with a 3-million-gallon saltwater outdoor aquarium stocked with 100 species of fish, including sharks, rays and barracuda.
There will also be fivepools, waterfalls, water slides and a quarter-mile-long "river ride." The hotel's 1,150 rooms and casino have been redone, and two new restaurants have been built, for a total of 12; one of the restaurants will be entered via a 100-foot-long clear tunnel through the aquarium.
Double rooms will be $130 to $325 a night, depending on date and location.
The Ocean Club, a 71-room resort that once belonged to Huntington Hartford, is being restored at a cost of $7.5 million and is scheduled to reopen Dec. 20.
It has been closed since October.
Double rooms will be $200 to $575 a night, and suites and villas will be $500 to $975.


What Horrifies Roaches and Grows on Trees?
THIS is the time of year when the Osage orange tree drops its fruits to the ground and people go scurrying about city parks and country roads to gather them up.
These yellow-green balls are as big as grapefruits, as bumpy as brains, a little sticky to the touch and oddly perfumed, with an astringency somewhere between those of cedar and citrus.
People love them -- because roaches hate them.
The Osage orange ball is a time-honored organic cockroach repellent.
I know because I've tried it.
I bought a few bumpy balls (for $1 apiece!) two years ago at the Union Square Greenmarket.
I was living in a roach-infested building in the Village and holding the line against exterminators bearing poisons.
Boric acid was fairly effective, but the lone survivor always seemed to scuttle across the kitchen counter just as guests arrived.


Ancient Stories Amid Candle Lighting and Spinning Tops
AT sundown today, as Hanukkah begins, Roxanne Coady will begin her usual celebration.
On each of the holiday's eight days, she will light another candle on the menorah in the window of her store, R. J. Julia Booksellers in Madison, and say a traditional prayer.
"We just do that. People outside can see it," said Mrs.
Coady.
Next Sunday afternoon she will invite people inside for a party, and on other afternoons she will invite them to smaller events featuring Hanukkah stories and traditions.
The events, geared to families, are open to all.
The party was launched in 1990, the year Mrs.
Coady opened her store.
Organizers of Madison's annual Christmas Festival and Parade -- sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce -- asked if she would have a story hour for children as part of the festival.
Mrs.
Coady said she would, but she noted that the 1990 festival occurred during Hanukkah.
"I'd also like to do Hanukkah stories and candle lighting," she said.


RUNNING LATE
Andrea Todd's reckless disregard for her own safety strikes me as fatalistic (Hers: "Running Late," Nov. 6).
Yes, violence is everywhere, and a woman is most likely to be its victim.
This is precisely why we shouldn't simply "get on with . . .  life in spite of it," anymore than we should forgo safe sex in the age of AIDS.


What's Bad for Politics Is Great for Television
WITH REPUBLICAN hopefuls already showing up in Iowa and New Hampshire, and with Democrats scrambling to position themselves for 1996, television gives signs of becoming the toxic-waste dump of politics.
Most of the criticism of the wretched campaign that the nation just endured has been directed at the candidates and their hirelings who turned out those noisome 30-second spots.
They deserve it, but negative advertising is only the tip of the sludge heap.
Television, as it has developed in the United States, is not merely a passive instrument of the cheap-shot gang.
The media manipulators are themselves controlled by the medium's conventions, and the audience is an accomplice to its own exploitation.


Commercial Property/Park Avenue; Landlords, Too, Hold Out for Mr. (or Ms.) Right
PARK AVENUE -- the very name connotes elegance.
Park Avenue doctor, Park Avenue lawyer, the Buick Park Avenue -- all are intended to convey high value at high cost.
Park Avenue landlords are not about to relinquish such name-association lightly.
And therein lies their dilemma.

Saving Books From the Paper They're Printed On

New Concern for St. Clare's Future
St.
Clare's Hospital and Health Center has had a roller-coaster of a decade, pulling itself out of bankruptcy and making plans for a modern new building on Eighth Avenue.
But today, the building plans are dormant, and some hospital officials fear that the center, whose largely poor clientele includes AIDS patients, the elderly and recovering addicts, may face a greatly diminished future.
Last month, doctors, employees, unions, neighbors and patients formed the Save St.
Clare's Committee, aimed at retaining the center as a full-size, full-service community hospital.
They say they have gathered more than 50,000 signatures on petitions to Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo and John Cardinal O'Connor.
The state regulates hospitals, and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York owns St.
Clare's.


Giuliani Rejects City Council Budget Plan
As promised, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vetoed the City Council's alternative spending plan to close a $1.1 billion gap in New York City's budget yesterday, calling the Council's proposal "blatantly illegal" and "fiscally irresponsible."
The Council's Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, a Democrat, said immediately that the Council would override the veto, setting up a legal confrontation over whose revision of the city's $31.6 billion budget would go into effect.


Versatile Butternut Squash A Cook's Favorite Standby
OF all the varieties of hard-skinned winter squashes, butternut appears to have emerged as the cook's favorite.
And with good reason.
Within the smooth beige shell that covers this oddly shaped vegetable is dense, deep-orange flesh that is richer-tasting and less watery or stringy than most of the sturdy cold-weather squashes.
It is a versatile vegetable, good for baking as well as for cooking.
And because it holds up well at room temperature for weeks, it can be kept on hand to use whenever it is needed.


Snob Appeal
The urge to go browsing in dictionaries, which comes over me often and only when I've got something else that I ought to be doing, has been brought on lately by a book on loan from a friend -- a slim paperback, first published in Paris in 1958, called "Dictionnaire du Snobisme," edited and illustrated by Philippe Jullian.
A whimsical compilation of entries that run the gamut from Anglomania and Bourgeoisie through Pronunciation and the Ritz to Versailles and Yachting, this is a book that has lost none of its charm over the past thirty-some years, though most of the names dropped in its pages now seem a little dated.
A writer by the name of Charles Morgan is quoted, defining snobs as those who invent arbitrary distinctions in place of the real ones.
What's most striking about snobbery as it's delineated here is the seemingly universal impulse behind it, the need not so much to identify oneself with some people as to disassociate oneself from others.
The forms that impulse takes are intricate and various, establishing the superiority of the aristocratic to the merely rich, of the longtime rich to the newly rich, of the newly rich to the bourgeois, of the bourgeois to the hoi polloi.
And then there's reverse snobbery, by which the down-home and the downtown come out in front.


A Wish List for Gadget Lovers
THE gift-giving season is before us, and some of the most interesting travel gadgets this year are refreshingly no-tech.
Perhaps it's the surfeit of batteries in gift packages that make basics seem welcome, or perhaps it's the monotonous rows of airline passengers poking at their laptops and Game Boys.
A favorite new item, the Aquis super-absorbent hair towel, weighs five ounces, uses roughly the luggage space of a T-shirt and makes a spur-of-the-moment swim feasible.
Compared with a luxury towel, this one, of nylon and cotton, seems skimpy, but it blots efficiently and can be packed damp in its own plastic envelope.
The standard version, 18 by 36 inches, is available by mail or phone for $17 plus $4.50 shipping from Traveler's Bookcase, 8375 West Third Street, Los Angeles, Calif. 90048; (213) 655-0575; (800) 655-0053 outside California.
This version and a larger 6-ounce one, 18 by 44 inches are sold at Bed, Bath and Beyond in New York for $16 and $20.
Worry-Free Winter Driving
The prettiest new gadget is the Ice Device, a sculptured-looking clear plastic windshield scraper designed to keep the user's wrist out of the action.
The stout scraper, said to be unbreakable, flows into a large loop handle that the user puts an arm through, taking pressure off the wrist, putting it on the lower arm.
Sixteen inches long, it probably will not fit into the glove compartment.
It was designed by Jonathan Hamilton of Ashland, Ore.; (503) 482-6407.
The Northwest Passages catalogue, which offers it at $12 plus $4.95 shipping, calls it the ergonomic ice scraper.
Northwest Passages, Box 1548, Medford, Ore. 97501; (800) 727-7243.
Last winter's weather has spurred the creation of devices to help drive the car out of snow.
One, the Bear Claw traction mat, is a pair of heavy-duty plastic pads, 6 inches wide and 22 inches long, with studs on both sides.
The pads are forced under the tires to give them something to grip.
A pair is $19, plus $4 shipping from Traveler's Checklist, Cornwall Bridge Road, Sharon, Conn. 06069; (203) 364-0144.
The homeliest item is called a Ranger Vest, which looks like those worn by photographers and is really just a vehicle for 11 pockets.
Maps can go into the big back pocket of the vest; cameras or lenses, small water bottles, jackknives, wallets or passports go into ones inside and out that zip or close with Velcro.
A khaki model, made in China, in small to extra-large sells for $35 at Barson Hardware, 35 West 44th Street, New York, N.Y. 10036; (212) 944-8181.
Michelin's big new tourist map of the United States reaches as far south as Monterrey, Mexico, and as far north as Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
Alaska and Hawaii are cut in.
The scale on this highly legible map is one inch to 55 miles, making the map 40 by 56 inches -- useless for the car but good for papering a wall, although that would rule out using the index on the back.
Land contours are indicated and roads down to the numbered state level are shown, as well as distances.
For a change, this was made in the United States.
Rolled or folded, it is $8; a laminated version is $30.
The map is at bookstores, or it may be ordered by calling Michelin at (800) 423-0485.
The popularity of impromptu picnics has spurred designers to rethink travel utensils.
Zelco, in Mount Vernon, N.Y., is importing Mangia, a full-sized stainless-steel utensil set with a knife that is certainly too sharp to be used by a child, but would deal with apples and roast chicken in short order.
The fork and spoon handles slide into the knife handle; a plastic cap, available in four colors, snaps over the working parts, allowing used utensils to be thrown into a pack unwashed.
The 6-ounce set costs $11 at Landmark Stationers, 330 Madison Avenue in New York; (212) 687-5885.
In the Attitudes catalogue from Sunnyvale, Calif., a set of six is $50 plus $7 shipping: (800) 525-2468.
Shedding Light in Dark
A good safety device for travelers who jog in twilight, or for children who walk home on one-lane roads, is a flattish flashing light three inches in diameter that clips to a backpack, belt or pocket.
Turned on, the six little bulbs light in rotation, creating a spinning effect that is said to be visible from half a mile.
It uses two AA batteries.
The Super Flashing Light is $14 from Barson or Northwest Passages, both listed above.
Fluorescent bulbs, which go easy on batteries, are appearing more often in portable lights.
The Micro Fluorescent Lantern, 6 inches long, 1 1/2 inches wide and 1 inch thick, has a three-inch fluorescent wand that folds out straight or can be set at a 90-degree angle to cast light while the case rests on a flat surface.
This is a fine hide-under-the-covers light for children, but would also help adults read maps in darkness.
The gadget has a flashlight bulb, too.
It weighs 5 1/2 ounces empty and uses four AAA batteries.
By Zelco, it is available for $30 from the Civilized Traveler in New York or the Brookstone catalogue: (800) 846-3000.
Zelco also makes Lumifier, a tiny pop-out magnifying glass with a red light for reading programs in the theater or phone books on the street.
The Museum of Modern Art Design Store in New York carries it, at $20, and it can be ordered by phone from Rand McNally for $15, plus $5 for shipping: (800) 234-0679.
Radio Shack's 6-in-1 Multi-Purpose Lantern, 11 1/2 inches tall, has a fluorescent lamp that casts enough light to read by.
It also has yellow and amber flashers to use by the roadside, a spotlight and a steady red light.
It stands on end and allows various lights to be operated in combination.
This uses six D batteries, or it can be plugged into a cigarette lighter in a 12-volt auto with a plug and cord that are included.
It costs $20 at Radio Shack stores.
Phone orders should refer to item 61-2743; (800) 843-7422.
Shipping costs $4.
Bibs and Talking Frames
If humans had been designed to eat from a tray wedged against their belt buckles, arms locked to their sides, there would be no need for Big Bib, but here it is.
Using a bib that protects chest and lap looks silly, but it may be preferable to walking the plane aisle with a tomato sauce boutonniere.
The five-ounce bib is 17 by 36 inches, terrycloth on top, vinyl underneath, with a Velcro closure.
It is $12.85 plus $3.75 shipping from Magellan's, Box 5485, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150; (800) 962-4943.
Well, technology cannot be avoided forever, and Magic Memories makes it seem worthwhile.
This 2 1/4-inch, 1 1/2-ounce folding plastic picture frame has a button to press to play back a 10-second message that the giver has recorded.
Traveling parents can hear a greeting or gurgle from the child whose photo is in the frame.
Magic Memories, distributed by Machina in San Francisco, is $20 plus $4.50 shipping from Traveler's Bookcase, at the address given above, or Casual Living in Tampa, Fla. ($4.95 shipping).
It costs $22.95, plus $6.85 shipping, from the Potpourri catalogue in Medfield, Mass.: (800) 388-7798.


The Lion King
Problems with a tattered tiger skin?
A moth-eaten moose head?
Who are you going to call?
Wild Bill's Trophy Hospital in west Los Angeles.
The owner, Bill Ornellas, says: "Game trophies and skins have a number of enemies, including dogs, cats, rodents and insects. Sunlight and dry air also take their toll." Some of Ornellas's repairs are difficult because living relatives of his "patients" are scarce.
"I no longer have tiger or polar bear fur to do repairs with. You can't get it legally." So Himalayan or Tibetan goat doubles for polar bear, and calfskin can pass for tiger.
Some of his projects are small -- fitting rabbit fur tails to Playboy Bunny costumes or replacing glass eyes pried from museum polar bear mounts by screwdriver-wielding youngsters.
Other jobs are big.
Ornellas once restored a prized tiger rug for Sylvester Stallone after the actor's guard dogs mangled it, no doubt mistaking it for a critic.


NY '94
To the Editor: I was amazed to see the letter from Thomas Di Domenico (Sept. 25) about the article by Susan Spano, "New York in a Package" (July 17).
I wrote a letter to Mr.
Di Domenico on July 5, and have yet to hear from him.
In my opinion, Mr.
Di Domenico is guilty of misrepresentation in saying that the Best Western President is a first-class hotel; my friend and I found the room (which we changed once) cramped, beastly hot, with inadequate air-conditioning in the New York heat wave.
Continental breakfast and free-parking were not included, as promised in the NY '94 brochure.


Wall Street; Honor Roll of Honest Companies
PUBLIC companies have been known to fudge, hide, and flat-out lie when it's time to file those irritating Federal disclosure documents.
The big and small fibs provide grist for the mills of everyone from regulators to short sellers to idle financial columnists.
For all the ink spilled on Corporate America's obfuscators, though, scant attention is paid to the players who tell investors honestly -- and in decipherable English -- whether business is up, flat, or about to hit the skids.
So here are some of the companies that supposedly do it right.


Islamic Militants Draw 20,000 in Show of Power at Gaza Rally
The Islamic group Hamas showed its political muscle to Yasir Arafat's self-rule government today, drawing as many as 20,000 supporters to one of the bigger rallies held in the Gaza Strip.
With tensions still running high after deadly battles eight days ago between the Palestinian Authority police and street protesters, all sides tried to keep the gathering from spinning out of control and igniting fresh violence.
They succeeded.


Coming Fiercely to the Defense of Social Security
A Post Office poster of the 30's, promoting the new Social Security system.
The Market Watch column on Nov. 6, "Social Security: The Issue They Chose to Ignore," drew a large, angry response from many readers.
A sampling follows: To the Editor:


PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
Brooklyn Botanic Garden To Bask in Holiday Light
Behind 30-foot glass windows, 1,000 white, red and peppermint poinsettias and hundreds of trees and ferns will glow with white lights starting Saturday at a holiday show in the Steinhardt Conservatory at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.


Inquiry Finds A Researcher Faked Work
In what would be one of the strictest punishments ever levied against a scientist, Federal investigators have recommended that a former researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology be barred from taking part in any federally financed research for 10 years.
The inquiry found that the researcher had faked data and falsified evidence for a 1986 scientific paper.
In a final appeal, the researcher, Dr.
Thereza Imanishi-Kari, has asked the Department of Health and Human Services appeals board to review the findings by the Office of Research Integrity, a department agency.
The appeals board is expected to act quickly on the matter.


Erwin P. Bottinger, Lynne V. Perry
Dr.
Lynne Valencia Perry, an interventional cardiologist in Washington, was married yesterday to Dr.
Erwin Paul Bottinger, a physician-scientist in nephrology at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.
The Rev.
Clifton Labbe performed the ceremony at Annunciation Roman Catholic Church in Houston.
Dr.
Perry-Bottinger, 33, graduated cum laude from Harvard University and received her M.D. degree from Yale University.
She is a daughter of Drs.
Levi and Eula Perry of Houston.
The bride's father is a cardiologist and her mother is a pediatrician.
Both practice in Houston.


Erin Kelly and Charles von Simson
Erin St.
John Kelly, a daughter of Norma L. Cummins of Cortland, N.Y., and Sean Kelly of Brooklyn, was married on Friday to Charles Burke Edward von Simson, a son of Kate F. Racine of North Smithfield, R.I., and Ernest von Simson of Manhattan.
The civil ceremony was performed by Walter Curtis, an officiating clerk, at the Brooklyn Municipal Building.
Ms.
Kelly, 31, is keeping her name.
She is the assistant to Anna Quindlen, the columnist, at The New York Times.
She graduated from Concordia University in Montreal.
Her father, a former senior editor of The National Lampoon magazine, is an author and television and film writer.
Her mother is a paralegal in Cortland.
The bride is a stepdaughter of Thomas Cummins and Patricia A. Todd.


Counting the Contribution of the Arts
WHICH statement is true?
Support for the arts comes at the expense of economic development.
Or, the arts are an industry that provides jobs that generate substantial revenues to local, state and Federal governments.
"The first statement is definitely false," said Janet T. Langsam, executive director of the Westchester Arts Council.
"For almost five years we have been researching the role played by the arts in community development, and our findings emphatically dispel any misconceptions about the value of the arts."


School Prayer Can Both Exclude and Coerce
To the Editor:
As a child in New York City in the 1950's, I found myself confused by the contradictions between the prayers permitted in the public school I attended and what I was learning in Hebrew school and my Jewish home.
I sought counsel from my pragmatic mother.
She advised: "Just move your lips. They'll never know."


WESTCHESTER GUIDE
THE FUTURE OF DANCE
An opportunity to review contemporary dance trends will be offered at the Dance Theater Lab at Purchase College on Friday at 8 P.M. and Saturday at 2 and 8 P.M.
The Saturday matinee will be followed by a discussion among dancers, choreographers and the audience.
The event is called "A New Generation of Dance in Westchester," and the featured dancer-choreographer is Wally Cardona, soloist with the Ralph Lemon Dance Company.
Mr.
Cardona will appear in the American premiere of a work he created on commission by Danscentrum in Stockholm.
All the remaining works, created and performed by emerging choreographers and dancers from Westchester and Rockland Counties, were selected by auditions on Oct. 30, or commissions awarded during the year by the Dance in Education Fund, a nonprofit advocacy organization based in White Plains.
Judges at the auditions were Bessie Schoenberg, dance educator; Carol Walker, dean of Purchase College's dance department, and Kevin Ward, choreographer and teacher.
Dawn Watson's "Solas na Gealaigh," drawn from traditional Irish music and dance themes, will be presented along with Karen Schatten's "Haircut," Tim Martin's "Small Feats," Caroline Oxenham's "Driftwood" and Carl Flink's "Doodle for Bunny Boy," a segment of his "Field Songs" scheduled in its entirety at the 92d Street Y in Manhattan next month.
Works by Steven E. Williams, Lea Kraemer and Eun Me Ahn will also be performed to music ranging from Vivaldi to Dave Brubeck and Duke Ellington.
Tickets are $15, $10 for people 62 and older, $7.50 for students and $40 for patrons.
Call 761-1118 for reservations or more information.
ALL ABOUT STAMPS
Michael Endres, owner of the Coin and Stamp Exchange in White Plains, will speak Thursday about stamps, the world's No. 1 hobby and the preferred investment for many collectors.
The lecture is scheduled at 7:30 P.M. in the Greenburgh Public Library, 300 Tarrytown Road, Elmsford, and admission is free.
Mr.
Endres is a certified philatelic appraiser and a member of the American Philatelic Society.
He has been a dealer in White Plains for two decades and a stamp collector for 29 years.
"It's not a short-term investment," Mr.
Endres said, "and to have a good long-term investment you should collect classical material in very good condition, not large quantities of modern issues."
He observed that good buying conditions have existed since 1988 when people started selling their holdings at discount prices during the recession.
"Now we are seeing an increase in price and a shortage of supply," Mr.
Endres said, because what was purchased in the recession "is being held by the buyers for future appreciation."
The Pacific Rim countries, especially China, are the hot spots for stamp collectors today, Mr.
Endres said.
"Some 1970's Chinese issues are extremely desirable," he said.
"They were illegal to own or to use as postage in China because they contained inflammatory political slogans. The Government issued other stamps at the time with which to mail letters." A MUSICAL UPDATE
Victor Herbert's "Babes in Toyland," produced as a touring holiday show by Troupe America under the direction of Curt Wollan, will be presented at Lehman College in the Bronx next Saturday at 2 and 7 P.M.
Decked out in new sets and costumes and accompanied by an ensemble, this version was written by William Mount-Burke and Alice Hammerstein Nathias.
Performances will take place at the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, at 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West.
Tickets are $20, $22.50 and $25; children will be admitted for half price at the 7 P.M. performance, and discounts for the elderly are available.
Call (718) 960-8833 for reservations or more information.
HOLIDAY BAZAAR
The Christmas ornaments that will be for sale next Saturday at the St.
John's Episcopal Church Holiday Bazaar in Larchmont can be embellished by Grace Coughlin, a calligrapher who will inscribe them with names or messages.
From 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. the church's Parish Hall on Fountain Square will be filled with gift items handcrafted by parishioners, including knitwear, jewelry, stenciled place settings and topiary.
In addition, there will be books, toys, antiques, textiles, electronic and sports equipment, a white elephant table and home-baked apple and pecan pies.
Children will be kept occupied from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. in a special corner with arts and crafts, games and a confidential chat with Santa, and lunch will be served from noon to 2 P.M.
For more information, call 834-2981.
JOHN JAY CHRISTMAS
The re-creation of Christmases past at historic sites provides a major source of entertainment, and the John Jay Homestead in Katonah, a New York State Historic Site, always puts on a first-rate show.
It will begin next Saturday with tours of the Federal-style mansion from noon to 5 P.M., continuing Sunday and the weekend of Dec. 10 and 11 at the same hours.
The house will be decorated from top to bottom, and a full complement of antique crystal, china, silver and replicated 19th-century foods will be set up in the dining room.
The parlor, where it was customary to adjourn for the last course of the Christmas dinner, will display desserts, and in the study, a punch bowl filled with citrus juices and Madeira will stand at the ready.
The decorations and foods have been carefully researched from notes left by the Jay family, and visitors who do not wish to be part of a tour may stroll through the house at will, guided by a descriptive brochure.
Special programs include Paul Peabody and his puppets on Dec. 10 at 1 and 3:30 P.M.
Children may sit on the floor at the foot of the stage, but chairs will be available for parents.
After each show, cookies and apple cider will be served.
On Dec. 11 the Bedford Bell Ringers will perform at 1 and 3:30 P.M. in the ballroom, and downstairs in the kitchen a costumed cook will talk about preparing Christmas feasts on an open hearth.
Visitors will be offered samples from 19th-century recipes.
More than 5,000 come to the homestead holiday celebrations, and it is wise to arrive for the puppet and bell-ringer performances at least an hour early.
Daily admission is $6, $5 for children and people 65 and older.
Proceeds help maintain the historic site on Route 22 off Exit 6 of I-684.
Call 232-5651 for more information.

Expand NATO -- And Split Europe
At this week's meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, the Clinton Administration is planning to push the alliance to begin the process of extending security guarantees to the new democracies of Central Europe.
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are the most vocal in pressing NATO to fulfill its promise to admit new members.
Visiting Warsaw in July, President Clinton said the Partnership for Peace, NATO'S program of military cooperation with its former adversaries, would lead to an expansion of NATO, and added that it was "no longer a question of whether, but when and how."


A Vote of No Confidence In Spread of Superstores
To the Editor:
I have been watching with dismay the superstores' invasion of New York, discussed in the Nov. 20 article, "Shop Big." It used to be one of the attractions of this city that the huge, homogenized, plasticized, boring chains were not to be seen.


A Long Battle Against Lead Contaminants
Throughout the spring and summer of 1987, a vacuum cleaner-like instrument perched on a factory rooftop here took readings that alarmed this still rustic town a two-hour drive from Manhattan.
Lead -- a cause of brain damage in children -- was drifting in the air.
An investigation by the state's Department of Environmental Conservation quickly focused on Revere Smelting and Refining, a plant that crushes old car batteries, melts down the scrap and salvages the lead for resale.
Over the following months, state officials also found lead in much of the 65-acre plant's soil and in groundwater just a mile from the water supply of this town two miles outside Middletown.


Versatile Butternut Squash A Cook's Favorite Standby
OF all the varieties of hard-skinned winter squashes, butternut appears to have emerged as the cook's favorite.
And with good reason.
Within the smooth beige shell that covers this oddly shaped vegetable is dense, deep-orange flesh that is richer-tasting and less watery or stringy than most of the sturdy cold-weather squashes.
It is a versatile vegetable, good for baking as well as for cooking.
And because it holds up well at room temperature for weeks, it can be kept on hand to use whenever it is needed.


Talk Radio Bulldog Is Really Just a Pussycat, Friends Say
IT'S another wonderful day in the neighborhood, Robert Gigante's neighborhood, and from the postman to the waitresses who serve him his morning pie and coffee, almost all say they are proud to be his neighbor.
Mr.
Gigante is better known to millions in the region as Bob Grant, host of a highly rated -- and sometimes highly criticized -- afternoon talk radio program.


Nov. 20-26: USAir Tries for Turnaround; Committed to Safety And Telling the World
Fighting to stanch a hemorrhage of passengers and avoid bankruptcy, USAir has hired a retired Air Force general in a new position as chief of safety operations and spent more than $1 million on a nationwide advertising campaign stressing the airline's commitment to safety.


Word for Word / Jesse Helms; The North Carolinian Has Enemies, But No One Calls Him Vague
SENATOR JESSE HELMS burst onto the public scene in 1960 as a hard-hitting, hard-right television commentator, and his recent verbal thunderbolts show that he has changed little.
The North Carolina Republican's attacks last week on President Clinton were hardly more vitriolic than those he has made on other favorite targets: homosexuals, Communists, Martin Luther King, leftists in Congress, bureaucrats and diplomats.
While slashing his foes during his 21 years in the Senate, Mr.
Helms has also used his rhetoric to champion values he holds dear.
The Senator, 73 years old, will no doubt get more attention now that he is in line to become chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
He is already off to a Helmsian, if not a diplomatic, start.
First, he said that President Clinton is not up to the job of Commander in Chief; then -- in a remark he later called a mistake -- he said the President is so unpopular that he "better have a bodyguard" if he visits North Carolina.


The Executive Life; Brokerages Building Women's Strengths
IN the dog-eat-dog world of selling stocks, bonds and other investments via mostly cold calls to a wary public, the competition facing brokers who are women is only getting greater -- and many of them like it that way.
Having long labored at a disadvantage in a business dominated by men, women who are stockbrokers have worked hard to distinguish themselves to their bosses and customers.
But at a number of brokerages, they have been getting significant help in recent years from the firms.
Advest Inc., Dain Bosworth Inc. and Raymond James &amp; Associates, for example, have all established support and networking groups for women that the members hail as an important forum for determining their own style and, in turn, markedly improving their sales.


Republicans Oppose Deal With Koreans
Asserting that President Clinton gave away far too much in the deal to halt North Korea's nuclear program, Republican leaders in Congress say they will seek to overturn the agreement by blocking funds to carry it out.
Republican lawmakers said in interviews this week that they were upset that $4 billion in international aid had been promised to North Korea even though it was not expected to permit inspections of several of its nuclear sites for five years.


Elizabeth Tao, B. E. Scheckowitz
Judge Elizabeth Jacqueline Yalin Tao, the daughter of James C. Tao of Palm Beach, Fla., and the late Margot H. Tao, was married on Friday to Bruce Evan Sheckowitz, the son of Myra and Jack Scheckowitz of Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
Associate Justice Israel Rubin of the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court, performed the ceremony in his chambers in Manhattan.
The bride, 33, is keeping her name.
She is a judge in the Housing Part of the New York City Civil Court in the Bronx.
She graduated from George Washington University and New York Law School.
Her father retired as a vice president of Citibank in Manhattan.
The bride's grandfather, T. Y. Tao, was the head of the Shell Oil-Asiatic Petroleum Company in Shanghai.


Fall Cleaning for a Better Spring Show
IT'S time.
Cleanup of the garden should be well under way.
End-of-the-season tending helps make the spring garden spectacular.
All those reminders of the previous year will be gone.
The bulbs, trees and early wildflowers can have the scene all to themselves.
A proper fall season tidy-up also reduces wintering hideouts for many insects, which like to snuggle down in garden debris.
Some insects also lay their eggs in plant detritus and removal of it makes their reappearance less likely.


Business Diary: November 20-25
THE ECONOMY The Stock Market Crumbles: Round Up the Usual Suspects Why, exactly, did stocks unravel Tuesday afternoon, with the Dow industrials losing 91 points, mainly in the last hour?
No one really knew.
There was the usual doubletalk about "support levels" and "corrections," but the only reasonable explanation seemed to be that investors suddenly grasped the idea that with interest rates rising, they could get better yields in bonds.
If so, they were a bit slow on the uptake -- it had been a full week since the Federal Reserve gave its latest shove to rates.
There was also talk that weakness in "cyclical" stocks -- the ones that rely on a strong economy -- yanked the wider market down.
But a lot of it is probably just trigger-happy traders: no economy is as bumpy as this market.
Sure enough, on Wednesday the market steadied, and on Friday the few traders who showed up sent the Dow to a 33-point rebound.


A Landmark Leaves San Francisco


Pharmacy Dean Opposes Tobacco
THE dean of the College of Pharmacy at Rutgers University has come under sharp attack from many drugstore owners for his calls for pharmacies to stop selling tobacco.
But that has not silenced the dean, Dr.
John L. Colaizzi, who leads the 900-student school here that trains the majority of the state's pharmacists.


Believe in Miracles? Well, Try 34th Street
For a few minutes tonight, a light, misting rain fell on the Orange Bowl.
The University of Miami was struggling and Boston College was driving and to many of the assembled crowd of 60,579 and some of the players on the field, it must have conjured images of that eerie night 10 years ago when Doug Flutie threw "The Pass" and Gerard Phelan caught it and B.C. shocked Miami and the country with the upset of the year.
But there were no miracles this time.
The rain stopped, and so did B.C., and Miami stormed back from a halftime deficit to defeat the Eagles, 23-7.


Jessica A. Feder, Alan H. Mentle
Jessica Ann Feder, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Jonathan M. Feder of Cincinnati, was married yesterday to Alan Harris Mentle, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Sam Mentle of Bellmore, L.I.
Rabbi J. Leonard Romm officiated at Tappan Hill in Tarrytown, N.Y.
The bride, 31, is an associate at the law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy in New York.
She graduated from Rutgers University and received her law degree from George Washington University.


Enter Galliano
THE HOTTEST TICKET IN town was an invitation that arrived tucked inside the front cover of an old leather-bound book, wrapped in parchment and tied with twine: a rose had been pressed between the pages.
And so what had perhaps been the library of some illustrious chateau was dispersed among a few hundred fashion editors and buyers, in Paris for 10 days in October to see the spring collections.
The volume addressed to me turned out to be "Principes de la Litterature," published in 1774 with the "approbation" of the king.
A loving attention to detail, a fascination with the artifacts of the past -- all this was no less than what we'd come to expect of John Galliano, the 32-year-old English designer who for years now has been routinely described as "promising."


Increased Free Agents Will Come With Cap
If major league clubs don't like the selection of pitchers currently available as free agents, they need only be patient.
More are on the way.
When the owners, as expected, declare an impasse and implement their salary cap proposal, they will also eliminate salary arbitration, establish a salary scale for players in their first four years in the major leagues and create a new class of free agents -- players who have been in the majors at least four years but fewer than six.


Where Mistrust Dies Hard
The meeting was meant to be an open forum for West Harlem residents to voice their concerns about the corruption scandal that racked the 30th Precinct this fall and to meet the new beat officers who have replaced some of the arrested ones.
And on the surface, that's what Tuesday night's gathering at the Convent Avenue Baptist Church looked like, with a smattering of polite questions from the 150 people in the audience and polite responses from five police officers and one sergeant.
But on a deeper level, fear and skepticism dominated, and those feelings were almost never expressed out loud.


2 Days From Pilgrims to Maccabees; Jews Do a Lot of Celebrating in a Season of Multiple Holidays
Somewhere between the time she popped her turkey in the oven and the time she wiped the crumbs off the table, Suzanne Farber managed to whip up a few latkes and freeze them.
"It's annoying," she said. "But you do it."


Sports of The Times; The N.F.L. Is Asking For Tragedy
YOU'VE seen it too often.
Quarterbacks stretched out as unconscious as a throw rug before wobbling to their feet after having been sacked or slammed.
Wide receivers as limp as a dishrag after having been blind-sided.
In the National Football League, it's known as the chance you take as a target.
Or is it as a trophy?


Are 20 Years Of Market Joy About to End?
IF there is one thing that 1990's investors have had pounded into their heads, it is that stocks are the best long-term investment.
Over the long stretch of history, we are told, stocks produce an average return of about 10 percent a year.
The academic studies prove nothing else does as well.
That belief in this is growing can be seen in the mutual fund industry's boom.
The stock market may have done nothing this year, but three of the four best months ever for stock mutual funds -- in terms of net cash flow from investors -- were in 1994.
Investors have put more money into stock funds than they took out for 48 consecutive months.
To put that in perspective, the industry's old record was 12 months, a string that ended with the 1987 crash.


Homeless Agency Still Dependent on Hotels, in Violation of Law
In yet another sign of the city's inability to provide enough housing for families seeking shelter, the agency responsible for the homeless has not been able to give up the use of commercial hotels for emergency housing despite a city law that restricts it.
On Sept. 1, the city's Department of Homeless Services placed 97 families in four hotels because all of the approximately 5,700 places for families in the homeless system were filled.
A 1993 law prohibits the use of hotel rooms without kitchens for more than 60 days, but last week the agency still had 76 families in three hotels.


Jennifer S. Motz, Garrett L. Going
Jennifer Susan Motz, a daughter of Mrs.
Francois P. Louis of Garden City, L.I., and George M. Motz of Quogue, L.I., was married yesterday to Garrett Leonard Going, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
James P. Going of Westhampton Beach, L.I.
The Rev.
Richard Delaney performed the ceremony at St.
Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in Garden City.
Mrs.
Going, 23, graduated from Rosemont College and is an interior designer for Jeanne Leonard Interiors in Westhampton Beach and Palm Beach, Fla., an interior design firm that is owned by the bridegroom's mother, Jean Leonard.
The bride's father is the executive vice president of Melhado, Flynn &amp; Associates, an investment management firm in New York.


The Electric Bulb
Like Persephone, fennel traffics between the darkness and the light.
Eaten raw, as crudites in the Italian manner, the white bulb with the pale green stalk has the sweet, sunny flavor of anise.
When fennel is cooked and served with fish or lamb, its aura becomes dark and mysterious, its licorice taste more pronouced.
Fennel is a giving ingredient, behaving like the vegetables it most resembles, onions and celery.
With its subtle, pervasive power, fennel can lend nuance to almost any dish.
But it need not be obtrusive.
Rather, it can serve as the unexpected bright note in a season of rich, heavy foods.


Ideas &amp; Trends; Sharper Image: The N.Y.P.D. Dresses for Success
ARRIVING from Boston last January to become the New York City Police Commissioner, William J. Bratton looked at his 31,000 officers, their two-tone uniforms, 25 pounds of equipment dangling from drooping gun belts, and saw service repairmen.
As a result, the New York City Police Department, will no longer look as approachable as it has for the last 22 years.
It will soon look like the Los Angeles Police Department.
Less Mr.
Goodwrench, more Terminator 2.
By next October the N.Y.P.D. will abandon its medium-blue shirt, putting on navy to match the trousers.
The dark style creates a more militaristic and, yes, more intimidating appearance.
Thus does N.Y.P.D. blue become L.A.P.D. blue (bare bottoms optional).


Diary Of an Urban Priest
"NEW YORK CITY, are you kidding?" the newly ordained John Flynn thought in 1958 as he contemplated his assignment to St.
Raymond's parish in the Parkchester section of the Bronx.
The son of a freight company executive, raised in Westchester and upstate New York, he knew little of the city except its air of danger.
"I knew the grass," he says.
"I knew mountains. I knew fields." A few years later, he took a confession at St.
Raymond's: "Someone said he committed a sin: walking on the grass. I wondered, how could it be a sin to walk on grass?"
Now at age 65, having spent his career ministering to the city folk, he sits in the rectory of St.
Martin du Tours on Grote Street in the central Bronx, the bright-eyed soul of youth not completely extinguished but alternating with the burden of the years.
There is no summing him up: He is a man whose spirit can at one moment leap joyously at the faith of the three women who bothered to attend Friday Mass, and at the next wonder helplessly at a drug operation across the street that delivers the ultimate insult: retailing a brand of crack, St.
Martin Green Cap, named after his church.

"Creating a garden full of color and interest throughout the year takes both planning and knowledge," Ms.

A Museum Space That Has Found a Museum Idea
IN ALMOST EVERY GREAT CITY IN the Western world, subliminal hunting horns have lately been heard.
They are the sound of a museum idea in search of a museum space.
In London, the Tate Gallery has found such a space on the south bank of the Thames, just across from St.
Paul's Cathedral.
In New York, the Museum of Modern Art is scouting for an additional new space.
In Paris, the Musee National d'Art Moderne is distinctly underhoused in the Pompidou Center.
In St.
Petersburg, since the downfall of the Soviet regime, the Russian Museum has been allotted new spaces all over town.


Lindsay de Wolf, Mitchell McKell
Elizabeth Lindsay Colt de Wolf, the daughter of Mrs.
Francis Colt de Wolf Jr. of Washington and the late Mr. de Wolf, was married yesterday to Mitchell Todd McKell, a son of Mrs.
Radames Pierantoni of Louisville, Ky.
Msgr.
Joseph H. Mundell performed the ceremony at St.
Matthew's Cathedral in Washington.
Mrs.
McKell, 28, is known as Lindsay.
Until recently, she taught ballroom Latin dance in Falls Church, Va.
She and her husband graduated from the Savannah College of Art and Design.
Her father was an insurance broker with Sun Life of Canada in Washington.
Her mother, Doda de Wolf, is an associate broker and vice president at Begg, Long &amp; Foster, a real estate company in Washington.
The bride is a descendant of Samuel Colt, the inventor of the revolver.

The Peculiar Dialect Of Sitcomese
A man is in bed, he has just turned out the light when he hears a suspicious noise downstairs.
What does he do?
Turn to his wife, sound asleep beside hime, and say: "Good thinking. I'll go check, see what that is. You stay here, guard the pillows."
He doesn't?
Maybe that's because unlike Harry Anderson, who spoke those lines in a recent episode of the CBS series "Dave's World," this man does not live in Sitcom World.
It's a peculiar planet, one where people sit on only three sides of the dining room table and have a language all their own.
In other words, no one in his right mind would ever say such things in such a situation.
But in Sitcom World, people say all sorts of improbable things, supposedly because they're funny.
Here are some guidelines for speaking elementary sitcomese, with examples from the current season.

What if her marriage hadn't ended?
There's a fair chance she would still be Walker today.

Memo on Chrysler Door Latches
Lawyers involved in lawsuits against the Chrysler Corporation have circulated a corporate document that indicates that the latches on the rear door of the company's popular mini-vans may be less safe than those of competitors.
The release of the memorandum this past week comes amid dozens of lawsuits as well as a yearlong investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration involving rear lift-gate latches on four million Chrysler mini-vans produced between 1984 and 1994.
The models include the Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager, and Chrysler Town and Country.

A Western Via Switzerland
To the Editor:
In his article "How the Nazis Created a Dream Factory in Hell"  [ Nov. 16 ] , Tom Reiss describes "Der Kaiser von Kalifornien," directed by Luis Trenker, as "a singular achievement: a Nazi western." But the film's singularity must be qualified by the fact that it was adapted from "L'Or" ("Gold"), a 1925 novel by the Swiss Surrealist Blaise Cendrars, who was in turn recounting the true-life story of the Swiss emigrant John Sutter.

Woo-Woo Philosophizing
To the Editor:
Karen Karbo's review of Tom Robbins's novel "Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas" (Oct. 30) begins by assailing Mr.
Robbins for his "Cuckoo plots, woo-woo philosophizing, overwrought metaphors and cheerful misogyny" and states that anyone who wasn't imprinted with his work when "19 and stoned" will find him "forever unreadable."
These statements, which precede any discussion of this particular novel, set the stage for a completely nonobjective review by a critic who obviously disliked this author's body of work before even picking up this new book.
Ms.
Karbo, true to this introduction, describes the novel as "vintage Robbins, a recommendation for those of you who can stand it."
Ms.
Karbo has an obvious intolerance for the elements of comic fantasy in Mr.
Robbins's works, and she is not averse to using bias and exaggeration to sway her readers to her point of view.
For example, she says that the cure for colon cancer portrayed in the book "cannot be described in a family newspaper." I'm betting that The Times will not shrink from printing the word "enema" if this letter appears.
I'm also betting that Ms.
Karbo wished her readers to think that Mr.
Robbins had used some "overwrought metaphor" too disgusting for general consumption.
Finally, Ms.
Karbo shares with us that she performed at least part of her critic's task with "a good 'Valley of the Dolls'-style buzz on." Feeling obliged to mix Xanax and chardonnay to "calm my nerves" because of an airport layover, she picked up"Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas" and found it both incomprehensible and "brilliant." Maybe Mr.
Robbins's work is simply beyond her grasp, especially if she insists on working while under the influence.
May I suggest that the editors find an objective and sober critic to review this comic and erotic novel, and consider referring Ms.
Karbo for professional help for her substance abuse problem.

Another View Of Slavery
In an otherwise encouraging article ("The Civil War Draws a Crowd," Nov. 13) two misleading observations were made about slavery that deserve re-examination.
The first was the assertion that there were no slave revolts during the Civil War even though it would have been easy since Southern men were off to war.

STRANGER THAN FICTION
On Jan. 1, 1992, I retired to pursue my dream of writing a novel (Endpaper: "Stranger Than Fiction" by Richard Liebmann-Smith, Oct. 30).
I spent six months in preparation -- reading, studying, thinking (and learning how to type and use a computer).
But the most helpful thing I did during those months was to get Sol Stein's WritePro.
I found the rules and questions most helpful.
And, unlike your writer, I have finished my novel.
It seems strange that someone who is still "working on a novel" after 19 years has the nerve to make fun of this outstanding instructional tool.
Liebmann-Smith should have put his energies into following the rules instead of making fun of them.

From Pizzeria to Red-Sauce Italian Fare
FROM a glorified pizzeria to an Italian palazzo," a reader wrote describing the recent renovations at Umberto's of New Hyde Park. The 29-year-old landmark made an Island-wide name for itself with its hearty Sicilian pizza.
It is still possible to stop by Umberto's for a slice of that pizza or a homemade dessert and cappuccino in the spacious, dolled-up pizza parlor.
The scene is glitz and bustle, red-and-white checked wipeable tablecloths, green-marble columns and ornate brickwork that alone is worth the trip.


After Growing in Success, Recycling Faces Obstacles
When the city with the world's largest garbage dump embarked five years ago on the nation's most ambitious recycling program, many said it would fail.
It was fine for the suburbs, the skeptics said, but in a city as complex as New York, it was the stuff of dreamers and crackpots.
At first it seemed they were right.
Recycling was expensive, the city was short of money, and the effort got off to a rocky start.
Steven M. Polan, the Sanitation Commissioner at the time, says it was put together piecemeal, "with strings and rubber bands."

Almost immediately though, he began listing all the good qualities about George.

Let's Go to Press!
To the Editor:
A postscript to your review of Neal Gabler's biography of Walter Winchell (Oct. 23):
Unable to find a job in New York in 1940, a B.A. from a respectable college notwithstanding, I enrolled in the Therese Aub Secretarial School in the Upper West Side.
I could type, but knew no shorthand.
Our assignment every evening was to take down Wichell's radio talks to all the ships at sea.
When we could do this successfully, we could hold down a job anywhere in Manhattan.

A Library's Historic Treasures in Tight Spaces
A GIFT of gold cloth reportedly from Captain Kidd, a 300-year-old Indian deed and a 200-year-old atlas from the days when Bay Shore was called Penataquit and Commack spelled Comac are samples of the past in three Suffolk County libraries.
But preserving the past does not come easily, especially in Smithtown, where space and finances are concerns.
Although it has one of the oldest and most extensive collections about Long Island history, the 87-year-old Smithtown Library has been beset with financial problems for several years, quashing any plans for expansion and causing complaints about the housing of its archives.

Editorial Notebook; East Germany's Last Laugh
In outworn cliche, Germans are as heavy as their national diet, bereft of a sense of humor.
A visitor here quickly learns this is not true of Germans in general, or in particular of Ossis, the former citizens of the Communist East.
This was readily apparent in Berlin this November, the fifth anniversary of the demise of the wall that scarred the city.
The sober German of stereotype was indeed visible in seemingly endless and earnest television talk shows on "die Wende," shorthand for the great change attending unification.
But in bookstores, there was a less formal observance, marked by the dry, even grim humor at which Berliners excel.


School Prayer Can Both Exclude and Coerce; Invasive Government
To the Editor:
The reinvigorated campaign for a school prayer amendment by political and religious conservatives points to an important assumption: that American parents are inadequate to teach their children about the power of prayer at home.
Lacking faith in real family values (that is, the ability of parents to instill values in their own children), conservatives quickly turn their backs on families and instead place their faith in the institutional power of government to do the job.

Paperless Publishing
To the Editor:
While reading Leigh Hafrey's essay "At Cyberspace University Press, Paperless Publishing Looks Good" (Oct. 30), I had the feeling of "Plus ca change." In 1492, Trithemius, a German Benedictine, wrote "In Praise of Scribes," in which he maintained that the new technology of print was merely novel, unlikely to last and, compared with copying by hand, not morally edifying.
Trithemius's optimism for manuscript production and pessimism for typography were both exaggerations, and many views on the computer revolution evoke this same ambivalence.
Traditional books will always be printed, and in good quantities, for the simple reason that when it comes to actual reading, they are vatly easier to use than a computer and monitor.
It is inconceivable that anyone would want to try to read "The Great Gatsby" (much less "Ulysses" or "Moby-Dick") in any form but a printed one.
On the other hand, as the essay points out so well, computer technology has already radically transformed the character of research, information management and publication.
When it comes to technological innovation, intellectual evaluation often yields to emotional anxiety.
Trithemius was wrong: by itself, print destroyed neither book production nor morality.
It did not even eliminate writing by hand.
If computerphobes take heart in this, computerphiles might take caution from the fact that the technology they seek to replace was itself once trumpeted as the ultimate solution to problems cognitive, pedagogic and economic.

Luxury Train Ride Back in Time
AS the world rocked gently beneath me, I felt as if I were still on the train.
But I was actually standing on a geological high diving board that jutted out from the rim of the Copper Canyon in the state of Chihuahua in northern Mexico.
Looking down, I could see what appeared to be a trickle of water -- really a river -- winding some 7,000 feet below.
I was perched on a boulder known as Balancing Rock because it balances precariously on a tiny stem high above the vast abyss.
It looks like a giant golf ball teed up for flight.
I was an ant on that golf ball.
Shifting my weight from one foot to the other, I could feel the great stone moving beneath me, and I could hear its great, low-pitched rumble of protest.
"Rock and roll!" shouted a member of my party.


The View From 61
WHAT DO YOU do when you're 61 and haven't rehearsed for it?
Well, to take an example, though I've cut my own hair for 30 years, this spring for the first time I put the trimmings out on the lawn for the various birds that search for hair to weave into their nests.
Using an audio tape, I've learned to identify many more bird calls than I knew at 50, and 10 times as many as when I was 20.
I'm up before 6 and when the dawn's chorus ceases I play other music, knitting an aural nest of Bach for organ, Beethoven for piano, Louis Armstrong, "My Fair Lady," Edith Piaf, "Peter Grimes," each day's menu impromptu (my dogs bark sharply when the whale songs come on) -- seldom much that I didn't listen to decades ago, but I pay more attention because after a spell of eye trouble, music and visual color seem central now.
I'm more moderate, gentler in judgment, less self-conscious, though quite cranky, yet recognizing other people's right to be cranky too.
For the sake of harmony I take more for granted and skim over more.
I'm still astonished, ineradicably so, by my generation's failure to push past token gestures to change the world for the good and to be less greedy and violence-prone than the generations before.
But money is old-hat to me, unexciting, although essential, neither of which it seemed in the past.
I used to despise money, which could have made my old age frightening, except that writers do not retire and my earning power has increased.
Sex has become like driving a car with 95,000 miles on it.
You don't go fast or dwell on the details but you do get there.
I know more about children, food, answering mail, theories of health, conversational tact, variants and staples of religious thought, highlights of art, and where I might like to be if a helicopter pilot were willing to lift me anywhere in the world.
When I walk in the woods I carry a stick to part the brush and lend me footing in crossing a stream, but this only reminds me of African spearmen I have hiked with and makes me feel young.
Beyond the memories I have, the balance and heft of a stick in my hand is primeval, as young as mankind can get.
It's a shorter journey back to my early teens, where I'll dawdle a while with Nat King Cole.
I've got the 1949 World Series on tape, Yankees versus Dodgers, the civilized banter of Red Barber and Mel Allen and the suspenseful feats of Tommy Henrich, Yogi Berra, Jackie Robinson, Preacher Roe.
When I need to leave the room, I re-experience that moment of panic that I'll miss DiMaggio's next at-bat -- and can remember the silent tears filling my eyes when the Yankees would lose a game.
I had a friend who grew equally teary on behalf of the Red Sox, so I suggested we call a truce and quit teasing each other about our grief, which just made it worse.
But he said no, that wouldn't be baseball.
I'm still loath to believe he was right, yet the evidence sits right here on the table.
Besides the violin partitas and "Goldberg" Variations that occupy some of the best of my days, I've acquired a radio scanner that plugs me into the muffled shouts of out-of-breath firemen, ambulance attendants, sheriff's deputies chasing a thief, state police zeroing in on a bank robber's flight.
Presumably these emergencies would hold no interest for me if gloating over another person's disappointment when his team loses were not also part of the appeal of sports.
There's malice in us till we die.
I've never met an elderly person fit in his faculties who was completely benign.
But the obverse of that is the incongruous picture we keep of ourselves as remaining forever around the age of 18.
Though closer to death, I am more reconciled, having seen my father, my ex-wife and four or five intimate friends die rather slowly -- events that were, of course, sadly cryptic but because of painkillers were no longer a terrifying mystery, scalding like hellfire, as they would have been hundreds of years ago, when hellfire was a buzzword.
I don't expect to rejoin or "miss" these people in the hereafter, yet, having spent a great deal of my personal and professional life riding a surf of wind-song, wolf howls, elephants snuffling, trees soughing, grasshoppers buzzing, frogs croaking, I do think I'll mix in somehow with all of the above, the wine of human nature blending with the milk of outdoor nature in a mulligatawny soup of soil, rainwater and pondy chemicals, with infinite possibilities once again.
Reincarnation or a heavenly life is the ultimate comfort offered by every religion I am familiar with, and I don't want to be me for more than another 20 years anyway.
Neither eternal oblivion nor me, but something else.
Maybe moss.
One could do worse.
Moss, if left alone, seems to live about as long as people do; then it goes back to mulligatawny soup again.
Having witnessed the Sudanese famine in 1993, I expect to see other scarifying tragedies that will ease me into a grateful grave.
But during my 61st year I also saw India on a first visit, and Antarctica -- tigers and ice.
As Renaissance men of a new kind, we should feast our eyes.
Instead, we fret about civilization.
Civilization is with us to stay.
I worry more about the toads' and the tree frogs' songs.
I want that stew to be yeasty with tadpole, muskrat and otter bones, loons' bills, lady-slippers, skunk cabbage, jack-in-the-pulpits and moose and bear pies, not just an ossuary of human relics.
Otherwise my moss is not going to thrive.


A Glittering 'Sunset' Rises
IT'S HERE AND IT'S A STUNNER.
IF YOU HAVE TO ASK what "it" is, you haven't been paying attention.
It's "Sunset Boulevard," Andrew Lloyd Webber's grand, sometimes to the point of grandiose, musical reincarnation of Billy Wilder's comparatively spare, satiric 1950 melodrama about a titanic Hollywood legend.
She's Norma Desmond, the epitome of camp, a forgotten but not gone silent-film star.
As played and sung by Glenn Close, the Dracula-like Norma is now shaking the I-beams and testing the acoustics at the Minskoff Theater on Broadway in a manner to set precedents.
Never has someone undead been so alluring, so entertaining and, finally, so crazily tragic.
Yet "Sunset Boulevard" is something more than a bizarre Broadway spectacle scored with some of Mr.
Lloyd Webber's loveliest melodies and designed with an extravagance of mind more usually evident at a theme park.
In adapting the classic film for the stage, the composer and his collaborators haven't only pumped up and inflated the Wilder work.
They have also created something original.


Taxes, Vouchers And Parochial Schools
Re: "Schundler Continues to Press Voucher Plan for Jersey City," Oct. 16:
The article on Mayor Bret Schundler's campaign for education vouchers in his community says that if the program is adopted, this would be the first time the nation has allowed public funds "to be spent on parochial education." One recalls that when Virginia attempted an "experiment" in public financing of church education, James Madison fought it, arguing that "it is proper to take alarm at the first experiment with our liberties."

NATO AND THE U.N. QUARREL IN BOSNIA AS SERBS PRESS ON
The United Nations and NATO, confronted by Bosnian Serb forces occupying part of a Muslim enclave the allies had vowed to protect, bickered today as the Serbian assault continued.
Favoring restraint, Lieut.
Gen.
Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, scrambled to avoid further NATO air strikes against the Serbs.
He enraged the Muslim-led Bosnian Government by blaming both sides for the fighting in the enclave, centered around Bihac town, and insisting that only negotiation could resolve the conflict.

Sighting Beauty On the Far Side Of Fear
WHEN HITCHCOCK'S "Vertigo" first came out, I was so scared by that silly spiral revolving out of the woman's eye during the movie's opening credits that I wanted to run out of the theater.
How could I just sit there in the dark and be willingly engulfed by all the creepiness foretold by that image and by Bernard Herrmann's creepy music?
But I stayed, and absorbed what became my earliest memory of art's power to extract pleasure from fear.
Two recent events in architecture brought that memory back to mind.
The first was the death last month of John Lautner, the Los Angeles architect whose dramatic hillside houses, designed over the past four decades, helped define the southern California life style.
The second was the opening of the Rem Koolhaas show at the Museum of Modern Art, an exhibition of public buildings that introduce a rich array of urban images for our time.


The Guns Of Davenport Avenue
WILLIE THOMPSON and Jose Santiago grew up together around Davenport Avenue in New Haven and thought of each other as brothers.
They often played football in nearby Evergreen Cemetery with another close friend, Elvis Crnkovic.
A star pupil and athlete, Elvis was well respected and urged his buddies to try to make something of their lives.
Three and a half years ago, Elvis, 16 years old, was shot dead in a drive-by attack in front of Willie's house.
"Elvis," Willie told a reporter, "was the man who kept me out of trouble."
Early last month, Willie Thompson, 17 years old, was charged with killing Jose Santiago, 21 years old, a few feet from the Crnkovic home.
After hearing the first of a dozen gunshots, Zdravda Crnkovic, Elvis's mother, ran screaming into her house.
Gino Crnkovic, her 22-year-old son, stood stunned, watching his friend bleed to death.
A few minutes before, Willie and Jose had been arguing over a bicycle and Gino had said, "Don't worry, Ma. In a few minutes they'll be best friends again."

Perfection: Penn State And Carter
There are no worn stone portals to reflect the passage of time at Beaver Stadium, no faded bricks to hold the memories that other Big Ten schools display, reminders that Red Grange played here, or Tom Harmon, or Howard Cassady.
But these Penn State Nittany Lions, led by the greatest day in Ki-Jana Carter's career, took their place as one of the most successful teams in Big Ten history today with a 59-31 victory over Michigan State that completed a perfect regular season.
With the swiftness and apparent ease that has marked this season from its beginning, Carter ran for 5 touchdowns and 227 yards to lead the Lions to their fifth 11-0 record under Coach Joe Paterno and their seventh undefeated, untied season in his 29 years as head coach.
Five of Penn State's eight touchdowns were scored on drives that were completed in less than two minutes against a Spartan team that began the game with the best pass defense in the conference.


Owners End Up on Opposite Ends of the Ice Over Solution to the Labor Dispute
Howard Baldwin and Ed Snider operate National Hockey League teams in the state of Pennsylvania, but they are coming from different directions in terms of the current labor lockout.
The postponement of the season passed through Day 57 today as talks recessed with no solution in sight.
They could resume as soon as Monday.
In separate telephone interviews recently, Baldwin of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Snider of the Philadelphia Flyers discussed the labor stalemate.


BENNINGTON MEANS BUSINESS
Mark Edmundson's gallant defense of innovative Bennington leaves out one crucial fact: Bennington's target audience is drying up.
No longer does the well-to-do young woman assume that her appropriate calling is a lifetime in the arts.
The woman's movement and changing mores make it likely that Bennington's students will want a more marketable, preprofessional degree.


Wasteland


The Nation; Deciding Who Gets What in America
UNDER the House Republicans' "Contract With America," certain groups, like unwed teen-age mothers and able-bodied unemployed men, are deemed undeserving of the Government's largess.
Both groups were excoriated in campaign rhetoric and cut off from public assistance in the contract's sketchy budget proposals.
But these same budgetary figures reveal something the rhetoric did not.
Among the ranks of the undeserving, by implication, is a group that has played by the rules, paid taxes, and demonstrated family values: legal immigrants.
These are not people who sneaked across the border.
They were granted visas to rejoin family members, to work, or, often, both.


SERVICE WITH A SNEER
I would not be surprised to learn that Charles Murray, co-author of "The Bell Curve," likes to eat at Denny's, when he's not sipping Champagne at 30,000 feet.
Although the menu might not be up to the standard of food served at those private dinner parties where he expounds on the correlation of race, economic status and criminal behavior, his ideas would be equally welcome at Denny's.
Murray might not even be disturbed that some Denny's patrons receive more prompt and courteous service than others.
He'd probably attribute it to differences in I.Q.

'The Coming Plague'
To the Editor:
As the New York City Health Commissioner, I would like to respond to Stephen S. Hall's perplexing review of "The Coming Plague (Oct. 30), Laurie Garrett's excellent study of the threat posed by new and re-emergent microbial diseases. Mr. Hall accepts the importance of the issues raised by Ms. Garrett, yet he complains about her thoroughness and attention to detail.
The matters discussed in "The Coming Plague" are serious and of significant concern, not only to scientists and public health professionals but also to the broader public.
The emergence of new infectious disease threats (like AIDS, Legionnaires' disease, Lyme disease, toxic shock syndrome and the newly recognized hantavirus syndrome), as well as the resurgence of old diseases (like tuberculosis, cholera, malaria and, most recently, plague), often in new and drug-resistant forms, should be a powerful warning that we remain extremely vulnerable to the microbial world.
With increasing urbanization, international travel, agricultural manipulation and environmental disruptions, these worrisome trends will only worsen in the years to come.
Indeed, as the AIDS epidemic reminds us, the possibility of lethal viral diseases for which we have no treatment is not science fiction, but an unfortunately real possibility that demands our focused attention.
The subject is well deserving of the comprehensive, sober approach it has received in Ms.
Garrett's hands.

Population Trends Hold Surprises
A REPORT issued earlier this month on the county's population has broad implications for educators, health-care workers and taxpayers, demographers and planning officials said last week.
The report, "Westchester County and Municipalities: Population Estimates for Jan. 1, 1993," found that last year's count of 885,731 follows moderate increases since 1990 and reverses a downward trend of the 1970's and 1980's.


POSTINGS: Chez Place des Antiquaires: Daffy's; Antiques Out Off-Price In
"Off-price" was an unwelcome phrase in the elegant subterranean precincts of the Place des Antiquaires, a collection of nearly 100 antiques dealers that dwindled to a handful over its six-year life before closing this year.
But by next fall off-price merchandise will set the tone for the two 27,000-square-foot floors beneath the curved facade of 135 East 57th Street, at Lexington Avenue.
"But we sell upscale off-price stuff," insisted Vance Wilson, the owner of Daffy's, the glitzy New Jersey-based discount clothing outlet that plans to occupy the space.
Daffy's, which already operates three stores in Manhattan, has signed a 15-year lease valued at well over $20 million for the now-vacant antiques showroom, with its artificial skylight, marble walkways and wood paneling.


Political Memo; DEMOCRATIC PARTY STRUGGLES TO FIND NEW EQUILIBRIUM
Three weeks after their top-to-bottom electoral wipeout, Democrats remain uncertain over what to do next and virtually leaderless beyond a President whom many in the party see as a big part of their problems.
Division, of course, is traditional among losing parties, and among Democrats even in the best of times.
But their current disarray has left a near vacuum for triumphant Republicans that is compounding the Democrats' midterm disaster.


The Gentle Art of Creating a Family Film
THE DIRECTOR JOHN Pasquin is well aware that at some point during "The Santa Clause," the new film that stars Tim Allen as a reluctant replacement for the man in red, children may be bored.
"There's a definite ebb and flow in the movie in terms of attention span," he explains.
"The kids are sort of hooked all the way through the North Pole, and then they drift, and then they come back toward the end, when Santa gets in trouble. But the very parts of the film where they start to pull back are exactly the points in the film where the adults start to lean forward."
Mr.
Pasquin made a conscious decision to use lines and situations that would make adults laugh.
Apparently, he succeeded.
Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, called "The Santa Clause" "a clever, entertaining children's film with a realistic edge and a minimum of seasonal mush." It opened to $20 million of business the first weekend and could be considered a model "family film," one that hooks all audiences.

School Prayer Tactics
"We can't be here suggesting the social engineering of the right will be more clever than the social engineering of the left."
Thus spake none other than Representative Newt Gingrich.
He was trying to reassure the Republican governors and governors-elect in Williamsburg that he had heard their message.
That message, put simply, was that Mr.
Gingrich should first secure Republican goals on taxes, the budget and welfare before scaring away voters by pushing the social-control agenda of religious conservatives.

Mutual Funds; Reader's Mail: Enduring the Rate Rise
Question.
I own shares in the Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund, which comprises about one-third of my individual retirement account.
The fund has an excellent track record; however, with the rise in interest rates and fluctuation in the bond market, I'm getting nervous.
I do not plan to become wildly rich with this fund, but neither do I wish to lose principal.
Please advise.
Answer.
Wellesley Income has performed exceptionally well during the last 10 years because of generally declining interest rates.
When rates rise, however, Wellesley's relatively static allocation of 60 percent bonds leaves management with few options to protect investors' capital.


Security Council Again Tells Serbs to Halt Attack
The Security Council tonight condemned the assault on the Bosnian town of Bihac and demanded the withdrawal of the nationalist Serb forces, but shied away from ordering any further military response.
The Council endorsed a statement that reiterated past positions demanding that the Bosnian Serbs stop the fighting and accept the peace accord agreed to last summer by all other sides in the Balkan conflict.


A Celebration of Women With an Independent Streak
MOST of the personalities celebrated in "Setting the Style: New Jersey Women Past and Present" made their marks in the 20th century.
Yet the show seems very much of the 19th century, and not just because it is staged in Macculloch Hall, the manse erected in 1810 by George Macculloch, a well-to-do Scotsman.
Nor does it have much to do with the furnishings of the house, which was bequeathed to the town in 1950 by its last owner, W. Parsons Todd.
The show's atmosphere is, rather, determined by its 17 women, whose feminism seems to have been more individualistic than that practiced today.
None were a Florence Nightingale or even a Mrs.
Beeton (who produced her foot-thick cookbook in 1861 only to perish from tuberculosis while still in her 30's).
But each warrants attention for accomplishments (or a personality) going against the grain of her time.

Dinosaur Site Is Made a Landmark
Unlike the fictional denizens of Jurassic Park, Hadrosaurus foulkii does not inspire terror.
But when its fossil was dug up in 1858 in Camden County, it caused a sensation: it was the first virtually complete dinosaur fossil found in modern times.
Now, with interest in dinosaurs rekindled even as they fade deeper into history, the site of the discovery has been declared a national historic landmark.


Torture by Army Peacekeepers in Somalia Shocks Canada
The snapshots, entered as exhibits in court-martial proceedings, show Canadian soldiers at a desert outpost in Somalia posing with a blindfolded, bruised and bloodied Somali teen-ager, who was tortured until he died a few hours later.

Streetscapes/320 West 55th Street; Neglected City Backyard Comes Alive Once Again
ONLY the exceptional owner can muster the will, the cash and, most of all, the vision to keep an urban backyard from deteriorating into littered hardpan.
So it would be unfair to single out the Rota Holding Corporation simply because it has neglected its once lovely back garden at 320 West 55th Street.
But the good news from the tangled back lot of this little 1920 apartment complex is that it is being reclaimed, inch by inch, by Joy Duchon, who makes a two-and-a-half-hour commute from Connecticut to fix up a part of New York that New Yorkers can't even take care of themselves.


A Benefit of Street Fairs: Freedom From the Auto
To the Editor:
Judging by his Oct. 30 Coping column, Robert Lipsyte doesn't like street fairs.
Community boards and city officials have been hearing a lot from the relatively small number of people who, like Mr.
Lipsyte, claim to be inconvenienced by street fairs.
They rarely hear from the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers and visitors who enjoy attending them.
In fact, with hundreds of well-attended events annually, street fairs are the single most popular outdoor activity in the city.


Becoming the Next Bernstein? (Or Boulez?)
Esa-Pekka Salonen IS IN THE BELLY OF the beast.
The brilliant young Finnish conductor has begun his third season as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the city of eternal celebrity is making its ominous presence felt.
A few blocks away, at the Los Angeles County Superior Court, the self-styled "trial of the century" creeps forward; endless banks of satellite dishes beam the epic trivialities of Judge Ito's courtroom into space.
The orchestra's home is the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, better known to billions as the historic arena of the Oscars.
Where Sally Field shrieked and Jack Nicholson smirked, where John Williams accepted an Oscar for his score to "Star Wars," Mr.
Salonen spent a day recently rehearsing Witold Lutoslawski's intricate, ambivalent Piano Concerto.
A decade ago, Mr.
Salonen was organizing sparsely attended avant-garde concerts in Finland.
Now, at 36, he holds the most important musical post in the most media-intense city in the world.
And he has made his task more difficult by maintaining a commitment to 20th-century repertory.
Rather than vanishing in the middle of the season, the Lutoslawski concerto appeared defiantly in the orchestra's gala opening concert, flanked by Prokofiev's "Classical" Symphony and Stravinsky's "Sacre du Printemps." A bias toward the modern also infuses the Los Angeles Philharmonic programs Mr.
Salonen will conduct this afternoon and tomorrow evening at Avery Fisher Hall, with music of Lutoslawski, Ravel, Schoenberg, Bartok, Sibelius and, the odd man out, Beethoven.


Taxes, Vouchers And Parochial Schools
I am afraid the recent article on tax financing of parochial schools dwelt on details of school tuitions and attendance and ignored the broader dangers of forcing citizens to support parochial schools against their wills and religious convictions.
Many deeply religious Americans, Catholics included, are greatly disturbed by the push to obtain public tax funds for New Jersey parochial schools.
It is wrong to demand tax financing for parochial schools when there is now tax exemption for the same schools.
Involuntary tax financing for parochial schools that are contrary to the religion of millions of other Americans will polarize the community along religious lines.
It will endanger the tolerance and religious peace we have enjoyed in America for over 200 years.
Religion is taught in the churches and Sunday schools, in absolute freedom.
That is what they are for.
The public school system, which has helped make America the greatest nation on earth, bar none, will be destroyed in time.
The public simply cannot support multiple high-quality school systems.
The average citizen just can't pay his regular taxes and support his church and support someone else's church, against his will.
Let's be very clear and honest about it: this radical plan means stupendous new taxes.
If the idea is such a panacea, and people are so supposedly for it, put it on a statewide ballot.
If the people vote "yes," fine.
If they vote "no," forget it.
And this is a lay, nonteacher citizen talking. JOHN TOMASIN West New York


The Moon, How Lovely! The Wit, How Elsewhere
BROOKLYN -- Pale and wispy as a trail of smoke, Pina Bausch, the German choreographer, dropped a cigarette with a long European-style ash onto the sidewalk.
Then, with the posture of the dancer she once was, she boarded the bus for Manhattan that was waiting by the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
The seats in front were full.
And so, without a word, she made her way to the back, past her international company of performers from the Tanztheater Wuppertal, who had just been behaving on stage as if they were psychotic in the sold-out matinee of "Two Cigarettes in the Dark" on Nov. 20.

The False Promise of Competition
To the Editor:
"Now, It's the Rick Scott Health Plan" (Oct. 30) includes evidence usually overlooked by policy makers and the media -- your writer included -- especially with regard to the myth that competition drives down costs and prices.

Let's Go to Press!
To the Editor:
Sitting at the counter of Al's Sandwich Shop on 23d Street in Miami Beach in the 1950's, I noticed Walter Winchell sitting right next to me.
I had a sealed letter addressed to my mother that I intended to mail after eating lunch.
"Would you mind signing on the back of this envelope?" I asked him.
"My mother would love to have your autograph." At frist he said no. but then he asked for the envelope, signed his name and drew lines around his signature.
He preceeded to talk endlessly all through lunch.
Among other things, he told me the difficulties of being a celebrity.
Everywhere he went, people expected him to pick up the check.
He was going broke by doing this.
I sat, entraced, listened as he spoke for more than 30 minutes and hardly uttered a word.
When the waitress tried to hand me my check, he grabbed it and said it was a pleasure for him to pay for my lunch, as I was the most interesting person he had met in a long time.

The Spies Who Stayed Out in the Cold
THE STATE WITHIN A STATE The KGB and Its Hold on Russia -- Past, Present, and Future.

A Family Intact, a Promise Fulfilled
In Rebecca Anderson's corner of the South Bronx, families are fragile in the face of poverty and crime.
But despite illness and need, Mrs.
Anderson has fulfilled a promise to keep her family intact.
Just before Mrs.
Anderson's mother died in 1983, she begged her oldest daughter to watch over their growing family.
Now, 30 years after her only child was born, Mrs.
Anderson is a full-time mother again.
At 54, she shares her cramped apartment with five nieces and nephews who otherwise would be in foster homes.


No No. 4, and Don't Even Think of Giving Him a Green Hat
How do you advertise to the thousands of Chinese immigrants in Flushing?
Some simple tips, to begin with.
Avoid the number four, which means death.
Just as many buildings here have no 13th floor, many Chinese high-rise elevators jump from the third to fifth floor, says Roger Lo, an advertising agent in Flushing.
But lucky numbers, like six and eight, are sprinkled liberally in ads.


Sikh Temple Helps to Bind A Community In Mourning
In the quiet Queens neighborhood of Richmond Hill, inside a nondescript brick building, is the heart of the borough's small Sikh community.
It is a Gudwara, or temple, where people isolated by geography, language and religion practice their faith, share a meal or exchange information on jobs and news of their native India.
They are something of a bachelor society.
Many came to the United States without their families, hoping to make enough money to bring their wives and children, siblings and parents from India, and most share apartments with other Sikhs whom they met through the temple.


Holiday Treat: A Turnaround, a Turning On
As the season's first snow fell faintly in downtown Flushing last week, holiday lights were turned on for the first time in a decade, red and green strings of lights crisscrossing Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue.
What had been a holiday tradition fell victim to the area's economic downturn in the early 1980's, said Regina Colletta, manager of Community Board 7.
Funds could not be raised from the new businesses trying to gain a toehold in an area that was changing economically and ethnically.

The Neediest Cases
Generosity comes naturally to Rebecca Anderson, but not always easily.
Despite a debilitating illness, she has struggled for years to keep her extended family together, taking in five nieces and nephews, including Omar, who is just 8 weeks old.
Her story is one of good intentions overwhelmed, a problem that the charities served by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund know all too well.

In America; Starve the Weak
The elderly woman was moving slowly up Lexington Avenue in East Harlem, her face ashen and her eyes tearing against the sudden wind and the cold that had rolled in on the day before Thanksgiving.
By the end of the day there would be snow showers, but the snow hadn't started yet.
The sun was still shining on a cold autumn morning that felt like winter.
The woman had a long brown scarf draped over her head like a hood.
Her steps were painfully slow.
She was heading north on Lexington, in search of a meal.
An old man had directed the woman toward Emmaus House, at Lexington and 124th Street, which provides a bit of food for the destitute and the working poor in a setting reminiscent of the Great Depression.

KURT MASUR
ALTHOUGH I'VE BEEN AN ex-New Yorker for 15 years I still root for the New York Philharmonic.
Like the Mets, it had seen glory days in the 60's, but by the 80's the orchestra had nearly lost its standing among the top five American orchestras to Los Angeles or St.
Louis.
It no longer had a long-term recording contract or regular radio broadcasts of its concerts.
In his 13 years as musical director, Zubin Mehta had appointed 42 new players but was unable to weld the orchestra into a disciplined team.
In 1991 the Philharmonic hired a new musical director, Kurt Masur, to restore its status.
Masur seemed a surprising choice.
He led the venerable Gewandhaus Orchestra, in Leipzig, but he lacked the renown of contemporaries like Klaus Tennstedt or Carlos Kleiber.
Ironically, Mehta's jet set image may have worked in Masur's favor; he was the least glitzy candidate on the Philharmonic's short list, which included Claudio Abbado, Bernard Haitink and Colin Davis.
With morale at the Philharmonic at a low point, players and administrators decided to replace easygoing glamour with dour precision.


Infra Rad
In the past, kids in school passed surreptitious notes on paper.
Now, companies like Sega and Casio are selling pocket communicator-organizers for $80 and up that let students send messages silently during class with the same infrared-light technology that is used in most television remote controls.
Some devices also allow kids to play a game called Battleship across the invisible link.
A spokesman for Sega insists that the company wants youngsters to pay attention in class and that the toys are meant for use out of school -- in tree forts, say, or at slumber parties.
Cool.


Time Warp
To the Editor: In "Essence of Maui: Quiet Upcountry" (Oct. 30), Lenore Magida reports on visiting the Kula Botanical Gardens.
When we were there the entrance fee was $3, but I see that it has gone up to $4 for adults, $1 for children 6 to 12.
At the time I thought $3 was a bit steep for what looked like a small botanical area.
I asked the woman behind the counter about discounts for us seniors.
I'll never forget how she looked me in the eye and said: "In Paradise we don't age." I paid.

School Prayer Can Both Exclude and Coerce; Back to the 50's
To the Editor:
The drive by Congressional Republicans for a constitutional amendment requiring school prayer should come as no surprise.


The Cry Was 'Workers, Unite!' (And Artists Too)
RUSSIAN POSTERS OF THE 1920's evoke in bold lettering and imagery the tumultuous period following the 1917 Revolution.
Among the most compelling are the news and propaganda posters -- intense, even witty bulletins that were printed daily on the cheapest paper and hung for all to see in the shop windows of Moscow.
While the political events pictured are as difficult to decipher as the Russian words describing them, the graphic power is unquestionable.
The broad appeal of this work can be seen in "Rosta, Bolshevik Placards: 1919-1921," an exhibition at the Sander Gallery, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, through Jan. 7. (Wall labels provide rough translations.)


New &amp; Noteworthy Paperbacks
SLEEPING BEAUTIES By Susanna Moore.
Vintage Contemporaries, $11.
This novel, set in Hawaii, traces the difficult maturation of a young girl, Clio, whose struggles to define herself as a woman are complicated by the odd behavior of her mother, her stepmother and her eccentric aunt Emma.
The book "expands a body of work that is eloquent and disturbing," Abby Frucht said here last year.


The Bad and the Ugly
Not every trip is a joy.
But that doesn't mean a bad trip can't be memorable.
In a new book, "I Should Have Stayed Home," 50 novelists, journalists and travel writers rhapsodize about their worst travel experiences.
The journalist Jeff Greenwald got dunked into an electric bath in Tokyo.
And the novelist Barbara Kingsolver was almost tossed out of New York's Rainbow Room (she violated the dress code).
Still, it's all perspective.
The novelist Joe Gores maintains, "Any trip you walk away from in one piece is a winner." The book, from Book Passage Press, is $13.95 at stores or may be ordered by calling (800) 999-7909.

End-of-the-season tending helps make the spring garden spectacular.
All those reminders of the previous year will be gone.
The bulbs, trees and early wildflowers can have the scene all to themselves.
A proper fall season tidy-up also reduces wintering hideouts for many insects, which like to snuggle down in garden debris.
Some insects also lay their eggs in plant detritus and removal of it makes their reappearance less likely.


A SENSE OF PLACE
DEAR Diary,
Looking back on it now, what a surprisingly delightful season it was, the winter of 1994-1995!
Hardly anything like last year's miserable New Jersey winter.
And certainly far from the predictions in the Farmer's Almanac, which forecast an even more extreme winter in the Garden State than that of 1993-1994.
Yes, of course, there were a few minor travails here and there.
And in truth, the season did present its share of annoyances.
But, Dear Diary -- here in the spring of 1995 -- how pleasant it is to review these pages and recall the bracing challenges of the winds of winter!
How satisfying to look back at the months we remember so well:


A Library's Historic Treasures in Tight Spaces
A GIFT of gold cloth reportedly from Captain Kidd, a 300-year-old Indian deed and a 200-year-old atlas from the days when Bay Shore was called Penataquit and Commack spelled Comac are samples of the past in three Suffolk County libraries.
But preserving the past does not come easily, especially in Smithtown, where space and finances are concerns.
Although it has one of the oldest and most extensive collections about Long Island history, the 87-year-old Smithtown Library has been beset with financial problems for several years, quashing any plans for expansion and causing complaints about the housing of its archives.


S-E-X Is the Talk of China (Well, Not All the Talk)
A sexual revolution of sorts is under way in China, not because the world's largest population has just discovered sex but because it is discovering how to talk about it.
In newspaper columns, on radio talk shows and over dinner, the Chinese are discussing sex, how to enjoy it and how to deal with its consequences more than at any time in this century.

Wide World of Food in the Capital
WASHINGTON has many faces, all seductive and nearly all reflected, one way or another, in the city's restaurants.
There is imperial Washington, city of monuments and imposing buildings, where the distinctive throb of political power is so different from New York's money and fashion power.
And there's the neighborly Southern town, a place of green parks, tree-lined streets and Georgian row houses.
And then there is international Washington, where the dress code covers everything from saris to sarongs, Mao suits to tribal robes.
Restaurant menus stretch around the world from the Middle East to Malaysia and back by way of West Africa, Central America and points in between.

POSTINGS: The Dix Hills Wall; Almost a Mile Long, It Gives a Project Privacy
"Something there is that doesn't love a wall" and "makes gaps," wrote Robert Frost in "Mending Wall."
His farm wall had to be mended every spring.
But a wall 7 feet high and 5,000 feet long running the full road frontage of a new Vanderbilt Manors West housing complex in Dix Hills, L.I., is going to remain intact "hopefully for a very long time," said the developer, Charles B. Mancini of the Park Ridge Organization in Ronkonkoma.


Should Historical Buildings Yield to Square Glass Boxes?
A GIANT metal claw started to rip away at the 100-year-old Laurel Street School in Branford one day late in October, only hours after a Federal judge in Hartford concluded that town officials had not acted unreasonably in deciding to demolish the school to make way for a new police station.
The destruction of the school was the culmination of a 10-month sometimes bitter battle between town officials and their supporters, who wanted to raze the school, and a citizens' organization known as SOS (Save Our School).
Eventually the battle also involved the Connecticut Historical Commission and the State Attorney General's office, both of which favored retaining the school building as a historically important structure.


83 Is His Age. His Golf Scores Are Lower.
IN a chance meeting outside the clubhouse at the Race Brook Country Club in Orange, Ed Silver feigned shock when, peering into George Dunham's golf bag, he found an outsized Big Bertha driver and a collection of other up-to-date graphite clubs.
"What are you doing using all of this state-of-the-art stuff?," Dr.
Silver, a retired dentist, asked with a smile.

Russia Admits to Accidents at Nuclear Plants During Soviet Years
In the early days of the cold war, explosions and fires at three plants in the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons manufacturing complex killed seven workers and injured a dozen others, a Russian newspaper has reported.
Western experts say the disclosures this month by Komsomolskaya Pravda shed light on Soviet efforts to boost nuclear production at all costs and a failure to adequately protect nuclear workers.


As Pope Inaugurates 30 Cardinals, He Condemns War in Bosnia
In a solemn ceremony at the Vatican, Pope John Paul II formally inaugurated 30 new cardinals today, using the occasion to inveigh against the "absurd fratricidal fighting" in Bosnia.
As if to underscore his message, one of the prelates elevated to cardinal was Archbishop Vinko Puljic of Sarajevo.
At 49, Archbishop Puljic was the youngest of those who were chosen to join the College of Cardinals, which will eventually elect a successor to John Paul.


Thrills and Chills of Marketing a CD-ROM Adventure

'The Coming Plague'
To the Editor:
As the New York City Health Commissioner, I would like to respond to Stephen S. Hall's perplexing review of "The Coming Plague (Oct. 30), Laurie Garrett's excellent study of the threat posed by new and re-emergent microbial diseases. Mr. Hall accepts the importance of the issues raised by Ms. Garrett, yet he complains about her thoroughness and attention to detail.
The matters discussed in "The Coming Plague" are serious and of significant concern, not only to scientists and public health professionals but also to the broader public.
The emergence of new infectious disease threats (like AIDS, Legionnaires' disease, Lyme disease, toxic shock syndrome and the newly recognized hantavirus syndrome), as well as the resurgence of old diseases (like tuberculosis, cholera, malaria and, most recently, plague), often in new and drug-resistant forms, should be a powerful warning that we remain extremely vulnerable to the microbial world.
With increasing urbanization, international travel, agricultural manipulation and environmental disruptions, these worrisome trends will only worsen in the years to come.
Indeed, as the AIDS epidemic reminds us, the possibility of lethal viral diseases for which we have no treatment is not science fiction, but an unfortunately real possibility that demands our focused attention.
The subject is well deserving of the comprehensive, sober approach it has received in Ms.
Garrett's hands.

BENNINGTON MEANS BUSINESS
It is no great surprise that schools like Bennington are having difficulty attracting students to fill classrooms.

Bosnian Ousts U.N. General From Talks
Bosnia's Prime Minister threw the top United Nations military commander here out of a meeting today, accusing him of blocking NATO air strikes that would help protect the Muslim enclave of Bihac from attacks by nationalist Serb forces.
After the meeting the Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, told reporters that the commander, Lieut.
Gen.
Sir Michael Rose, had told him explicitly that the United Nations would not order NATO air strikes against the Serbs.


Northern Ireland Hopes For a Brighter Image
BOMB-SHATTERED storefronts and British soldiers in full combat gear patrolling blighted neighborhoods are hardly images conducive to building tourism, but they have been the reality in Northern Ireland for decades, at least in Belfast and other cities across the province.
But now, with the terrorist organizations on both sides of the Northern Ireland conflict having declared cease-fires and pledged themselves to the peace process, the British Government has high hopes for promoting a more attractive image of Northern Ireland and stimulating a big increase in tourism.

The Nation -- Alamo? What Alamo?; Texans Want to Get Closer to Mexico
SOME 158 years ago, Texas firmly declared its independence from Mexico, and its citizens adopted an equally firm sense of self.
Whatever they were, they were not Mexican.
The image of a tall Texas Ranger, his six-shooters still smoking, standing over a stack of limp but conclusively disciplined Mexicans who were inevitably identified as banditos, made Texans feel that all was right with the world.
But now, Texas looks at Mexico and wants back in.
So badly that classes are springing up around the state, sponsored by community colleges, chambers of commerce and government agencies, to help Texans turn themselves into Mexicans.


The World; Begging for Mercy For Rwanda -- Earlier This Time
IT has not been six months since the end of Rwanda's bloodshed, a civil war in which hundreds of thousands of Tutsi were slaughtered and a million Hutu fled into exile.
Now the question is: When will the violence start again?
The President of neighboring Burundi fears that it will be before the end of the year.
United Nations officials in Rwanda say no longer than two or three months.
These people have been observing the soldiers of the former Rwandan Government, who are well equipped -- artillery, mortars, armored personnel carriers, even three helicopters, according to a United Nations intelligence report -- and can buy more with millions of dollars looted from the country's banks.


Let's Go to Press!
To the Editor:
Sitting at the counter of Al's Sandwich Shop on 23d Street in Miami Beach in the 1950's, I noticed Walter Winchell sitting right next to me.
I had a sealed letter addressed to my mother that I intended to mail after eating lunch.
"Would you mind signing on the back of this envelope?" I asked him.
"My mother would love to have your autograph." At frist he said no. but then he asked for the envelope, signed his name and drew lines around his signature.
He preceeded to talk endlessly all through lunch.
Among other things, he told me the difficulties of being a celebrity.
Everywhere he went, people expected him to pick up the check.
He was going broke by doing this.
I sat, entraced, listened as he spoke for more than 30 minutes and hardly uttered a word.
When the waitress tried to hand me my check, he grabbed it and said it was a pleasure for him to pay for my lunch, as I was the most interesting person he had met in a long time.

Soccer Field Is a Gift, but Neighborhood Says 'Not on Our Turf'
It has long been said that Americans do not fully appreciate the joys of soccer.
By now, the Norwegian Government might be willing to leave it that way.
In a goodwill gesture during the World Cup last summer, the Norwegians gave an $80,000 field of artificial turf to the community of Red Hook.
Ten days after its dedication, neighborhood youths set it on fire and burned a hole in it.
The field was removed.

One of the world's great veteran players was on track to win yet another title at the American Contract Bridge League's Fall National Championship here today.
George Rapee of Manhattan, who won three world team titles four decades ago and is a youthful 79, is the captain of the team that led after Friday's qualifying stage of the prestigious Reisinger Board-a-Match Teams.
His teammates, all experienced professionals, are John Solodar of Manhattan; Bill Eisenberg of Boca Raton, Fla.; Richard Reisig of Delray Beach, Fla.; Sam Lev of Forest Hills, Queens, and Piotr Gawrys of Poland.


New Shock For Politics In Japan
The political earthquake last year that ended nearly four decades of one-party rule here had settled in recent months into quiet maneuvering over who would control the slow reconstruction of Japan's political order and how much the economy would be opened.
But the apparent calm has suddenly been broken, with the conservative rebels who brought down the old system voting to dissolve their new parties in a kind of parliamentary free-for-all and the Socialists, led by Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, on the verge of splitting because of a deep ideological rift.

A Family Intact, a Promise Fulfilled
In Rebecca Anderson's corner of the South Bronx, families are fragile in the face of poverty and crime.
But despite illness and need, Mrs.
Anderson has fulfilled a promise to keep her family intact.
Just before Mrs.
Anderson's mother died in 1983, she begged her oldest daughter to watch over their growing family.
Now, 30 years after her only child was born, Mrs.

Sports of the Times; Pass the Crawfish Pie, It's the Bayou Classic
BY the time Grambling kicked off to Southern to start the 21st annual Bayou Classic yesterday, the tone for this intense intrastate rivalry had already been set.
Friday evening, 40,000 fans jammed special sections of the Superdome for the annual battle of the bands between the two Louisiana schools.

Woo-Woo Philosophizing
To the Editor:
Karen Karbo's review of Tom Robbins's novel "Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas" (Oct. 30) begins by assailing Mr.
Robbins for his "Cuckoo plots, woo-woo philosophizing, overwrought metaphors and cheerful misogyny" and states that anyone who wasn't imprinted with his work when "19 and stoned" will find him "forever unreadable."
These statements, which precede any discussion of this particular novel, set the stage for a completely nonobjective review by a critic who obviously disliked this author's body of work before even picking up this new book.
Ms.
Karbo, true to this introduction, describes the novel as "vintage Robbins, a recommendation for those of you who can stand it."
Ms.
Karbo has an obvious intolerance for the elements of comic fantasy in Mr.
Robbins's works, and she is not averse to using bias and exaggeration to sway her readers to her point of view.
For example, she says that the cure for colon cancer portrayed in the book "cannot be described in a family newspaper." I'm betting that The Times will not shrink from printing the word "enema" if this letter appears.
I'm also betting that Ms.
Karbo wished her readers to think that Mr.
Robbins had used some "overwrought metaphor" too disgusting for general consumption.
Finally, Ms.
Karbo shares with us that she performed at least part of her critic's task with "a good 'Valley of the Dolls'-style buzz on." Feeling obliged to mix Xanax and chardonnay to "calm my nerves" because of an airport layover, she picked up"Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas" and found it both incomprehensible and "brilliant." Maybe Mr.
Robbins's work is simply beyond her grasp, especially if she insists on working while under the influence.
May I suggest that the editors find an objective and sober critic to review this comic and erotic novel, and consider referring Ms.
Karbo for professional help for her substance abuse problem.
STUART WITTENSTEIN Jersey City


Grand Dame of the G.O.P.
NEVER mind that it was late November and that Election Day had come and gone and that a victory had been won.
There was still work being done the other day at the Old Glory Republican Club, a small storefront on Myrtle Avenue in the heart of Glendale, Queens, Marguerite Adams's main turf, where she has lived since 1923.
"You never seem to have enough time," said Mrs.
Adams, as she studied the unofficial returns on oaktag posters along the wall.
"The day after an election you start to work all over again."


A Bold Work That Honors Survival
AT FIRST GLANCE, IT COULD have been a therapy session.
In a small theater in Madison, Wis., three men and two women sat in a semicircle, looking a little nervous.
But the graceful, powerfully built man seated at the end, the one with the wire-rimmed glasses and closely shaved head, spoke warmly, gently.
Soon people relaxed, even laughed, as they followed his lead.
"I want each of you to stand up and create a movement, a little picture of yourself," he said.
And one by one, the movements flowed.
A wiry young man slapped his chest, then thrust out his arms.
"I am sending myself out into the world," he said.
A little later, the man with glasses asked questions.
"Tell me about the day you learned you were ill. How would you imagine spending your last day?" Each person in the group answered thoughtfully, almost eagerly.
"When I learned I was H.I.V. positive," said an elegant young man, "I became a lot more appreciative of how fragile life is, how ephemeral beauty is, the pleasure in movement." A woman with a French accent spoke next.
"People looked at me and said 'How can you have cancer? You are so healthy.' "


Dolphins After One Thing: Momentum
Jeff Cross, the Miami Dolphins' defensive end, sat at his locker, cutting tape off an injured ankle and drawing hope from the fickle nature of momentum.
"One minute you've got it, another minute you don't," he said.
"Last month we had it going for us and the Jets had it going backward. Today, it's vice versa."


Christmas Eels
Americans like chestnuts roasted on an open fire.
Over in Italy, they like to cook up a mess of eels, which is fortunate for Maurice Bosse, below, of Montross, Va.
Up and down the East Coast, fishermen trap eels, but there's a minuscule domestic market.
In Asia and Europe, however, the slippery fish are smoked, barbecued and stewed.
As vice president and manager of George Robberecht Seafoods Inc., Bosse sends as much as 35,000 pounds of eels a week (and alive) by air -- "The eels are kept cool in waxed cardboard boxes" -- to Frankfurt, from which they're trucked to Holland, Belgium, France and Italy.
He also likes to sample his product.
"I prefer them stewed with greens and herbs," Bosse says.
"Stewed eels are a real treat."

Bugging the Family Car
It's the classic crime of American teen-agers: "borrowing" the family car for a furtive spin around town, preferably at 90 miles an hour.

Past Sheds Light on Clinton and School Prayer
State Senator Luther Hardin received a telephone call from the Governor one day in June 1985.
Bill Clinton wanted to talk about prayer in the schools.
Just days before, the United States Supreme Court struck down an Alabama law, almost identical to the one in Arkansas, that had provided for a period of prayer or silent reflection at the start of each school day.
In light of that ruling, Mr.
Clinton wanted to pass a new bill.


In White Plains, More Than Location
IN an area once barren of restaurants, Sweetwater's has for the last decade filled that void and often quite nicely.

But we are pleased to report that at the moment the kitchen seems to be on the rise once more.
Sweetwater's has advantages other than its location.
It fulfills the various dietary needs of the surrounding community by offering decent food ranging from lustrous entree-sized salads to hefty two-pound lobsters.
Another amenity, a daily specials menu tucked into the regular menu, lists the fresh fish of the day, and they are worth a look.
And although tight, the casual dining space is also attractive with prints of Parisian street scenes and cascades of greenery.

To the Editor:
Regarding the latest computer whiz kid, Michael Simmons ("Age 16, and Success Is Sweet," Sound Bytes, Nov. 6), it's a shame he couldn't find the motivation to finish Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath." Fortunately he had the electronic form and could still get an "A" -- after all that's the important thing.
It speaks volumes about our current society when we read of a 16-year-old, already earmarked for success, who has mastered the computer keyboard but is "bored" with the account of a family struggling through the Great Depression.
If only the Joad family could have traveled the information highway instead of Route 66, they may have merited more interest from the next Bill Gates.

Auctions Aboard Ship
Cruise passengers bored with the usual shipboard activities can now bid on a little culture.
Holland America recently initiated art auctions on two of its ships, the Westerdam and the Maasdam; the line plans to offer them on the entire fleet by early next year.
The art, framed lithographs -- signed and unsigned -- prints and silk screens by artists like Picasso, Erte, Chagall and Norman Rockwell, is mostly in the $500 to $600 range.
The auctions are being run by Concessions Services, based in Miami.
The line will hold four auctions during seven-day cruises and five auctions on 10-day cruises.

A GREAT SHROUD has been drawn across the mind of America to make it forget that there is a world beyond its borders.
Except when showing "Star Trek" or some imitation, the three main television networks obsessively focus their cameras on domestic tales and dramas, as if the end of the cold war rendered the rest of the planet irrelevant.
Their news staffs occasionally visit some massacre, famine or shipwreck and their star anchors may parachute into Haiti or Kuwait for a photo op, but these spasms of interest only emphasize the networks' apparent belief that on most evenings the five billion folks out there don't matter one whit.
Midst all the agitation about immigrants in California and Texas, have you seen even one good report on the 23 million refugees roaming the globe?
Or the response to immigrants in Germany or, if it could be found, Canada?
After all the hype given to Charles Murray's portentous I.Q. alarm, did you catch even a single network asking what other societies think about intelligence tests?
Or what they've learned about the relationship between talent and economic growth?

Jerusalem to Amman the Slow Way
PEACE had come to the Middle East, at least part of it, and all I had to do last October was travel from one of the countries signing the peace -- Israel -- to its new partner -- Jordan -- to write about it.
Easy.
After all, if two lands have just overcome a hurdle of history and faith, politics and war, surely travel between them must be part of the deal.
Not only that, on the map Jerusalem and Amman are only about 50 miles apart, so shouldn't it be simple to hop in a cab and cross one of the Middle East's great fault lines?


Janet Agoglia, Christopher Andolina
Janet Agoglia, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward Agoglia of Glen Cove, L.I., was married there yesterday to Christopher M. Andolina, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Salvatore M. Andolina of Amsterdam, N.Y.
The Rev.
Domenick Graziadio performed the ceremony at the Roman Catholic Church of St.
Rocco.
Mrs.
Andolina, 26, is an associate at the New York law firm of Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett.
She graduated magna cum laude from Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., where she was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
She received her law degree from the University of Chicago.
Her father is a consulting engineer at Han Padron Associates, an engineering firm in New York.


Martha Byrne and Michael McMahon
ON the soap opera "As the World Turns," Martha Byrne plays Lily Grimaldi, a young woman who wears Versace suits and tight-fitting gowns and is married to an Italian millionaire.
She lives on a yacht but is about to move into a mansion.
Her emotional life is a disaster -- she has two mothers (one biological and one adoptive) and a former true love who has suffered amnesia because of a car accident and now can't remember her.
Off the set, Ms.
Byrne, 24, is anything but a troubled diva.
She drives a four-wheel-drive Toyota truck, wears jeans and work boots and often spends Saturday nights singing in an Irish pub with friends, few of whom are celebrities.
And on Nov. 12, she married someone who is not at all a show-biz type, Michael McMahon, 27, a New York City police officer.


Paperless Publishing
To the Editor:
While reading Leigh Hafrey's essay "At Cyberspace University Press, Paperless Publishing Looks Good" (Oct. 30), I had the feeling of "Plus ca change." In 1492, Trithemius, a German Benedictine, wrote "In Praise of Scribes," in which he maintained that the new technology of print was merely novel, unlikely to last and, compared with copying by hand, not morally edifying.
Trithemius's optimism for manuscript production and pessimism for typography were both exaggerations, and many views on the computer revolution evoke this same ambivalence.
Traditional books will always be printed, and in good quantities, for the simple reason that when it comes to actual reading, they are vatly easier to use than a computer and monitor.
It is inconceivable that anyone would want to try to read "The Great Gatsby" (much less "Ulysses" or "Moby-Dick") in any form but a printed one.
On the other hand, as the essay points out so well, computer technology has already radically transformed the character of research, information management and publication.
When it comes to technological innovation, intellectual evaluation often yields to emotional anxiety.
Trithemius was wrong: by itself, print destroyed neither book production nor morality.
It did not even eliminate writing by hand.
If computerphobes take heart in this, computerphiles might take caution from the fact that the technology they seek to replace was itself once trumpeted as the ultimate solution to problems cognitive, pedagogic and economic.

In the Region/Westchester; Plans for Tara, an Irish Cultural Center, Make Gains
THE creation of Tara Circle, a multipurpose Irish cultural center in the village of Briarcliff Manor, moved a step closer to reality this month when the village Board of Trustees voted unanimously to approve a special-use permit, allowing the center to be established on the grounds of the 58-acre King's College campus.
This is the first and perhaps most difficult hurdle that faced the group seeking to build "the largest Irish cultural institution outside of Dublin," according to Edward A. Sheeran, chairman of Tara Circle Inc., whose executive committee comprises eight area businessmen.


The World; Bosnia Makes Atlantic Unity An Oxymoron
LIKE a slow cancer, the Bosnian war is eating away at the Atlantic alliance, laying bare a divergence of strategic interests so basic as to raise the question of whether France and Britain can truly be considered America's allies, at least in the way that they were in confronting Moscow during the cold war.
Last week the issue was Bihac, yet another small, hitherto unknown Muslim enclave in Bosnia under assault from Serbs.
The Clinton Administration wanted stronger action beyond the two selective NATO air strikes carried out last week against Serb positions in Croatia and Bosnia.
It proposed an immediate demilitarization of the Bihac area backed by the threat of new, more destructive NATO air raids.

TERRY TRUCCO


Spies &amp; Thrillers
Mark T. Sullivan, a former reporter for The San Diego Tribune and The San Diego Union-Tribune, has written an extremely deft first novel, THE FALL LINE (Kensington Books, 850 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022; $20).
Not many investigative journalists have the sensitivity and poetry that are exhibited in this book.
The central character is Jack Farrell, a successful investment banker in California who represents a powerful Central American businessman.
Farrell finds himself a hunted criminal because of what his job is really all about: laundering money for a drug cartel.
Mr.
Sullivan effectively interweaves flashbacks, stream of consciousness and, above all, exciting action.
Farrell is a daredevil skier, and heads to the mountains of Utah when he goes on the lam.
He accepts a job offer from a mysterious Frenchwoman who is making a documentary film about skiing.
Meanwhile, Government agents and drug lords are after him.
All of the characters in "The Fall Line" are believable.
The reader identifies with the flawed hero, with his wife, even with the smart, civilized drug kingpin who sets Jack Farrell on the wrong course.
The title of Ross Thomas's latest thriller, AH, TREACHERY! (Mysterious Press/Warner, $21.95), is adapted from Plutarch's characterization of Romulus: "He loved treachery but hated a traitor." And treachery is what this novel is all about.
Mr.
Thomas, a very skillful writer, lets us dangle for a while -- who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? -- as he unfolds his story in natural, free-flowing language laced with humor and sophisticated dialogue.
His protagonist is Edd Partain, a Vietnam War hero who is now a clerk in a Wyoming gun shop.
Partain is sitting on a secret that is political dynamite.
A figure from his past turns up and puts some pressure on him.
Suddenly Partain finds himself working for Millicent Altford, a smart woman who raises money for politicians.
A lot of money has been stolen from her, and she wants Partain to help her get it back.
Things get confusing.
Something very big is going on.
Powerful people want Partain out of the way.
The C.I.A.'s dirty-tricks division shows up.
Two generals try to outwit each other.
Unsavory politics and politicians are laid bare.
Mr.
Thomas makes some pertinent observations.
He is concerned about the ethics problem that has so many American voters convinced that their elected representatives are puppets on the payroll of lobbyists or the special-interest conglomerates.
Millicent Altford knows what to do.
This is her response to a Congressman who has asked for advice on how to reform campaign financing:
"Simple. . . . Do away with soft money. Provide Federal financing. Establish campaign spending limits -- proportional ones, of course -- so somebody running for the Senate in New York can spend more than somebody running for it in South Dakota. You know all the cures. It's just that most of you guys don't want to take them."
We have all read a great deal about the Mafia.
Now here's another crime family, this one from East India.
In Mitchell Smith's novel KARMA (Dutton, $22.95), we are introduced to some especially nasty types.
Evan Scott, an architect in New York, is examining the skeleton of a New York skyscraper his firm is constructing when a woman falls to her death from the building.
An accident?
Murder?
The police actually suspect the architect.
When he and his family find themselves in danger, he assumes the initiative.
The hunted becomes the hunter, and Scott, aided by a sweet, dignified, elderly Indian, uses the skills he acquired as an officer in the Vietnam War.
Mr.
Smith, the author of the thrillers "Daydreams" and "Stone City," is good at depicting mounting terror.
He has created a monster of a killer, an Indian giant working for the crime family.
Toward the end there is a chilling duel on the beams of the skyscraper, and there is a final shoot-out that pushes belief a bit too far.
But no matter.
"Karma" will keep you engrossed.
In IXTAPA (Donald I. Fine, $19.95), E. Howard Hunt brings back Jack Novak, now on special assignment for the Drug Enforcement Administration in Mexico.
Novak's objective is to penetrate a drug cartel, which he does in no-words-wasted pulp prose.
Everything is predictable, but it's fun in a junky, innocent way.
In STONE DANCER (Pocket, $22), the British writer Murray Smith concocts a computer scam that could involve the ruin of the American dollar.
The Israeli Mossad, the Sicilian Mafia and the United States Secret Service all make appearances.
The novel is unbelievable and cliche-ridden, but it's also lively and action-packed.

Slice of Post-Dinosaur Life
"Teeth, Tusks and Tar Pits" is the evocative title of the newly opened permanent exhibit on life after the dinosaurs at the Field Museum in Chicago.
The 7,000-square-foot exhibit picks up where the museum's "DNA to Dinosaurs" exhibit leaves off, with fossils, life-size copies, dioramas and videos exploring climatic change and mammal evolution during the ice age.
Fossils found in Wyoming and dating to 52 million years ago, when that part of the continent had a subtropical climate, include a lake community with water lily leaves, a turtle and a fish in the act of swallowing another fish.


Merchants Plan Gesture to Bridge the Gap With New Jersey
Fed up with what they say is a growing exodus of consumer dollars out of their neighborhood and across the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge into New Jersey, more than two dozen merchants in Bay Ridge are planning to stage a protest against New York State's sales tax.
The merchants, mostly on the commercial strips of Third and Fifth Avenues, have agreed to discount their prices by 8.25 percent, the same percentage as the state sales tax, for a single day.

In South Salem, a Pipe Organ Worthy of a Bach
IT might be called the Jessye Norman of pipe organs, custom designed and fitted and possessed of a powerful pair of lungs.
But its builder, Stephen J. Russell simply called the organ his Opus 27 as he supervised its recent installation at the South Salem Presbyterian Church here.
Organ experts talk in human terms about their instrument.
Organs have voices, their pipes have lips, ears, feet and toes, they inhabit rooms of their own.
Or, as the organist Robert Fertitta pointed out one recent morning here, the organ room is the instrument, because the chamber is filled with the pipes and wind mechanisms that produce sound.


Why Low-Price Steakhouses
THERE is nothing spontaneous or mysterious about restaurant trends.
They do not just happen.
There are reasons they occur and patterns behind them.
The current surge of budget steakhouses is typical.
They are the hottest ticket on the Island.
This wave of pubby, casual, inexpensive restaurants mmoving across Nassau and Suffolk is beginning to obscure other trends like Italian family style restaurants, California cuisines, tortilla storefronts and even brick-oven pizza spots.


Fall Cleaning for a Better Spring Show
IT'S time.
Cleanup of the garden should be well under way.
End-of-the-season tending helps make the spring garden spectacular.
All those reminders of the previous year will be gone.
The bulbs, trees and early wildflowers can have the scene all to themselves.
A proper fall season tidy-up also reduces wintering hideouts for many insects, which like to snuggle down in garden debris.
Some insects also lay their eggs in plant detritus and removal of it makes their reappearance less likely.


School Prayer Can Both Exclude and Coerce; Not Anti-Religious
To the Editor:
We are concerned that "Clinton Reaches Out to G.O.P. on School Prayer Amendment" (front page, Nov. 16) does not explain fully why a strict separation of church and state is important, thus perhaps leaving the incorrect impression that separationists are anti-religion.


Pataki Camp's New Orders: March in Line Or Not at All
The message sent by Governor-elect George E. Pataki's Thanksgiving purge of Ralph J. Marino as majority leader of the State Senate had all the ambiguity of a mobster's hit in a crowded restaurant.
As Mr.
Pataki and his Republican allies consolidate power after two decades of Democratic rule in Albany, they have sent clear signals that there will be little tolerance for dissent, and little forgiveness for those who gambled against them.
In Albany's new order, it seems, the newly powerful believe it is better to be feared than loved.
That may be because Mr.
Pataki won the governorship with only 49 percent of the vote, and because the driving force behind his victory was the deep disenchantment with his opponent, Mario M. Cuomo, rather than his own popularity.
Or it may simply be a matter of political style by a Republican hierarchy that has won time after time by playing relentless hardball.


If You're Thinking of Living In/Edgemont; Like Scarsdale, but With a Lower Profile
WHEN customers walk into Susan Synder's real estate office in Scarsdale they are usually looking for a house in that affluent village, known for its older-style housing and excellent school system.
"When I hear that their primary interest is the schools," said Ms.

Officer Hurt in Queens Standoff
A man in Queens opened fire on two police officers from his second-floor window yesterday, striking one officer in the left hand, and then barricaded himself in the apartment for about two hours before surrendering, the police said.
The man, identified as James Donikian, 47, of 58-24 43d Avenue, fired five times at the officers with a 9-millimeter pistol as they walked toward the apartment building to investigate a report of an emotionally disturbed man, said Detective Andrew McInnis, a Police Department spokesman.


Nov. 20-26: Defusing a Nuclear Threat; Uranium Brought to U.S. From Ex-Soviet Republic
It sounded like a plot of a novel.
More than half a ton of highly enriched uranium -- enough for dozens of bombs -- lay near a nuclear fuel fabrication plant in a remote area of the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan.
Afraid that the bomb-grade material might find its way to Iran, Iraq, North Korea or some other third world trouble spot, the United States began a project, code-named Sapphire, to bring it to America.
After secret negotiations, a team of American officials went to Kazakhstan and transferred the material into 1,400 stainless steel containers, each the size of a quart can of oil.
Then three huge American C-5 transport planes flew the uranium nonstop to the United States, completing the project just before the winter snows closed in.


Peace and Aid In the Middle East
To the Editor:
"In Israel, a Ho-Hum Response to Peace" (World Markets, Oct. 30) was salutary.

Dr.
Linneman, 32, is keeping her name.
She is a first-year fellow in pulmonary and critical care medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.
She graduated cum laude from Dartmouth College, and she received her medical degree from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, as did the bridegroom.


A Very Bad Year for the Neediest
A new administration at City Hall has begun the unpleasant task of making the city face fiscal reality.
No department, no program, however worthy, will be untouched by the cuts in funding needed to balance the city's budget.
For New Yorkers who have been just barely hanging on, these cuts will have devastating consequences.
For some people, it will mean the social services they have depended on to keep food on the table, to keep a home intact or to keep their adolescents out of trouble will disappear.
But New York's fiscal troubles will not only mean a reduction in services for the poor.
One of the preferred methods for cutting the city's expenses -- cutting jobs -- will create more poverty.
Many people who hold low-ranking city jobs are minority women.
When layoffs come, they are often the first to go.
For them, such jobs are the difference between self-sufficiency and welfare.
City payroll cuts will inevitably mean a swelling in the welfare rolls, just when the city can least afford it.

BENNINGTON MEANS BUSINESS
Elizabeth Coleman is a president any college would be lucky to have; through her leadership Bennington will achieve the best of its possible futures ("Bennington Means Business," by Mark Edmundson, Oct. 23).
But she is not responsible for the redesign of the college.
That buck stops on the board room table.
It was the board of trustees, responding to its legal and fiduciary responsibility, that conducted the symposium, assessed and developed ideas from every quarter and made the decisions set forth in our report, including the criteria that governed personnel decisions.

Little Smoke, Little Tar, but Full Dose of Nicotine
Faced with shrinking markets and mounting attacks by anti-smoking groups, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company plans to market a cigarette next year that produces little smoke or odor and no ash but still contains as much nicotine as regular cigarettes.
The company, which has spent about $500 million in the last decade developing the low-smoke cigarette, is gambling that such a product can bring new life to the industry.

A Crystal Ball
To the Sports Editor:
Less than 24 hours before the Dallas-San Francisco game, Thomas George predicted in "This Matchup Is All It's Pumped Up to Be," (The Times, Nov. 13) that the "unknown, unheralded, unhyped free safety Merton Hanks is a prime candidate to produce the big, game-swinging play." Actually, Hanks made two game-swinging plays by intercepting Troy Aikman twice at the goal line, thereby saving the 49ers from defeat.

Holiday Season Selling
EVERYONE'S so busy preparing for the holidays in the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas that it's gained a reputation for being the worst possible moment to sell a home.
Small wonder that the number of new listings tends to fall off dramatically.
So does the traffic.
At William Pitt Real Estate, a Connecticut brokerage, the number of binders typically drops by 30 percent in December compared with the rest of the year.


Phoning Home
To the Editor: I read with great interest the Practical Traveler article "What It Costs to Phone Home" (Oct. 23), in particular the explanation offered by Oncor Communications as to why their rates border on highway robbery.
In September I was traveling in Maryland and stopped for dinner at a fairly expensive restaurant in Frederick, a city that hardly struck me as the sort of backwater Oncor says it serves.
I made a nine-minute credit card call to New Mexico from the pay telephone in the restaurant, which, when I got my telephone bill, logged in at $18.09.
When I called Oncor and pointed out that I could have called Paris for what they were charging, I got the same story they gave your author.


The Executive Computer; Help for Users of Corporate Databases
SO you bought the relational database software; you bought the client/server paradigm; and you bought the pitch that this technology would make information broadly available across your organization, only to discover that you and your employees had to learn to speak fluent SQL?
That's pronounced "sequel," and it's short for structured query language, which is the lingua franca of all modern database management programs.
Unfortunately, SQL bears only slightly more relation to English than it does to Urdu or Klingon, so non-programmers need not apply.
In practice, this has meant that while information might be broadly distributed through an organization, users cannot get at it without the help of the management information systems staff, typically known as M.I.S.


Irish Parties Seem to Be Making Progress Toward New Coalition
Nine days after the collapse of Ireland's Government, party leaders seemed today to be making progress toward forming a new coalition, which would avoid the necessity of calling a general election to end the political confusion.
The turmoil began when Labor Party members protested an effort by Prime Minister Albert Reynolds to promote his Attorney General to President of the High Court.
The Attorney General, Harry Whelehan, had failed to extradite a Roman Catholic priest to Northern Ireland to face charges of child molestation.
Labor pulled out of the Government, and Mr.
Reynolds, a member of Fianna Fail, resigned as Prime Minister on Nov. 17.


'Muggers: Why Do they Exist?'
Crime statistics don't tell all.
In his poem "Muggers," Gabe Leibowitz, a 15-year-old sophomore at the Day School on West 88th Street, explored the toll of everyday fear.
He wrote it at the Poetry Center Schools Project of the 92d Street Y. Muggers -- Why do they exist?
Do they have fears?
Apparently not,  for they attack you Without a thought.
Grabbing hands, rough voices, Sometimes even weapons.
A knife put  to your throat, a gun Aimed at your head.
You think, "What's the point  of resisting?" Your money is gone.
Your bus pass is gone.
What is peace?
Why is it so hard to find?
If you run into a gang, you may As well empty your pockets.
"Hey kid! Give me your money!" "S-s-sure." Safety is hard to find in New York.
Walking the streets, you walk with a Friend, trying to avoid an attack.
Your friend leaves; just  3 more blocks.
But alas, You are mugged again.
When I see a group I feel scared.
I try to walk across the Street, if possible.
But once I didn't And it hurt.
A black kid and a white kid Came up to me and my friend.
They took my pass.
I was very frightened.
But my friend got the worst of it.
In 5 quick minutes His shoes were on the feet of one kid.
After that experience I learned a lesson.
In a flash, I'm across the street When I see a gang.
That is all.


Culture Should Know No Boundries

The two million Canadian receivers of CMT will get the Canadian Country Network instead.


Gun Is Brandished, Plainclothes Officers Fire and 2 Men Die
Two plainclothes officers were patrolling Crown Heights on bicycles on Friday evening, on the lookout for muggers and pickpockets, when they came across a crowd on a street corner that is a frequent outpost of small-time drug dealers.
A man pulled a BB gun from his waistband, prompting both officers to open fire, the police said.
Two people were killed.
One was the man said to have pulled out the BB gun; the police said he was hit nine times.
The other was 300 feet away, walking outside the grocery store where he worked, when he was hit by a stray bullet.


A Truly Swinging Version
To the Editor:
Here in outstate New York, Ken Van Etten, the mainstay of the Corning Grassworks, a local bluegrass band, has been wowing audiences for years with a unique rendition of "In the Pines." His version features a solo on the "sewer pipe" (a crinkled, blue plastic tube about five feet long and three inches in diameter), which, when swung furiously in circles around his head, enables Mr.
Van Etten to produce an eerie wail of varying pitch.
He does it for laughs -- and gets them -- but still, the weird sound combined with that tune and those old words is surprisingly effective.

All of Those Triple Axels Are Leaving the Skating World Dizzy
With the attack on Nancy Kerrigan, figure skating has lost its innocence while experiencing unprecedented popularity, opportunity and chaos.
Ice wars have broken out this fall between so-called amateur or Olympic-style skating and professional skating, which features such familiar and accomplished stars as Kerrigan, Kristi Yamaguchi, Brian Boitano, Katarina Witt, Viktor Petrenko, Scott Hamilton and Paul Wylie.
Promoters, television networks and big money have joined the fray.
Even fans have become embroiled in a sideline skirmish.
At stake is nothing less than control and legitimacy of the sport, the importance of the Winter Olympics and the direction of skating toward the future.


As U.N. Packs Bags, Fear Grows Among Aid Groups in Somalia
As United Nations peacekeeping troops prepare to withdraw from Somalia with no political settlement in sight, fears are spreading among aid organizations that their departure will open the way for looting, violence and the destruction of recently established relief programs that have improved life for many Somalis.
CARE has recently pulled all its workers out of outlying towns and cities, leaving only a small contingent in Mogadishu, the capital.
United Nations refugee and relief agencies met recently in Nairobi, Kenya, to plan a strategy for their widely scattered workers, who will have no international police protection or ready access to aircraft for evacuation after the peacekeeping troops leave.

The Gotcha! Gang
TO TEST READERS and to pull mail, I occasionally stud my political diatribes with mistakes in English.
These studied solecisms not only make me seem human, but also provide the basis for the annual review in this nonpartisan space of the "Uofallpeople" file.
"Et tu, Safire?" writes Klaus Perls of New York, adding, "Then, English, die!" What moved my corrector to this Caesarean mock-horror was this rhetorical question I posed in telling the Secretary of State how to deal with North Korea: "Which works best, the promise of reward or the fear of punishment?"


Facile Versifying
To the Editor:
Regarding Linda Gregerson's review of John Ashbery's "And the Stars Were Shining (Oct. 23): Again we are treated to panegyrics -- "national treasure," "part of a larger provisionality," etc., etc. This championing of Mr. Ashbery -- a facile versifier at best and an overrated verbal meanderer at worst -- is simply unsupportable. Why isn't it obvious that this writer writes the equivalent of cotton candy? Bite, swallow and there's nothing there.
Having read Mr.
Ashbery and having come to the aforementioned candy conclusion, I thought that listening to him read his own work would show me what I was missing, and as director of the International Poetry Forum I invited him to Pittsburgh some years ago.
Mr.
Ashbery in person gave me the same impression as he did on the page.
Here was seemingly sophisticated dullness raised to new heights.
Why then this cavalcade of praise for such an opaque writer when there are poets like Galway Kinnell, W. S. Merwin, Mona Van Duyn, Linda Pastan, Hayden Carruth, Derek Walcott, Seamus Heaney, Barton Sutter, Brendan Galvin, Peter Makuck, Philip Levine, Charles Causely, Philip Booth, Miller Williams and Naomi Shihav Nye -- writers of genuine talent and vision with something to say -- unignorably among us?
I have heard Mr.
Ashbery's prominence attributed to everything from another example of the tale of the emperor's new clothes to the influence of a friendly cabal on the East Coast.
Who knows and who cares?
The result is that we have pseudo-poetry passed off as the real thing.

One Golfer Does Not a World Tour Make
For any important professional golf event to succeed, it must have four elements: television, venues, sponsorship and players.
This equation is immutable in the golf world, and it can be applied to the current question of a World Tour to determine whether the grandiose plan to start one in 1995 is viable.
Let's begin the process.
Does World Tour Inc., the body that hopes to stage eight tournaments next season, have television?
Yes, resoundingly.
The Fox Television Network, hungry for spring and summer sports programming, has committed to televising all the tournaments.
Does it have venues?
Yes.
John Montgomery Jr., the executive director of the World Tour, has made assurances that many top golf courses are champing at the proverbial bit to play host to tournaments.


SERVICE WITH A SNEER
Kohn's contention that "there is a reform era at Denny's" because "employees must watch a 16-minute videotape about diversity" and "managers must attend sensitivity seminars" perfectly illustrates how the therapeutic mentality infests everything nowadays.


Ishmael Reed Takes On 'American Hypocrisy'
FOR Ishmael Reed, longtime literary provocateur, there may be no better place in New York to showcase his new play than the Nuyorican Poets Cafe.
Good sight lines, decent acoustics, exuberant outlaw clientele and a penchant for multicultural expression: just the right elements for "The Preacher and the Rapper," which runs through Jan. 1.
The play, directed by Rome Neal, examines the philosophical clashes between a rap star, an avaricious vegetarian President and a publicity-hungry minister and illustrates the potential for factionalism in modern society.
"It's about American hypocrisy," Mr.
Reed said after a recent performance.
"In this play we take on the hypocrisy of those who criticize rap for its misogyny and sexism when they belong to institutions that practice the same things themselves."

Surprising Rutgers Stays on Its Run
Rutgers played one of the toughest schedules on the college level during the regular season and it is now paying dividends in the playoffs.

Enola Gay Moves as Debate Goes On
After a 10-year, $1 million renovation, the front part of the fuselage of the Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, was moved early Wednesday morning from a warehouse in suburban Maryland to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.
Moving the 60-foot-long section of the plane was the quietest step thus far in the preparation of an exhibition, "The Last Act: The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II," a look at the decision to drop two atom bombs on Japan in August 1945.


In All-Male Revue, Art Meets Noise
It is a bland fact of nature that falsetto goes up, not down: men's voices can climb into mezzo-soprano or even soprano registers, while most women's voices cannot likewise descend.
The male transgression most often results in excruciating noise, but it can sometimes attain high art; there are several countertenors presently before the public who produce genuinely beautiful mezzo tone.
In the case of La Gran Scena's all-male opera revue, seen on Saturday night at the Kaye Playhouse (Hunter College, 68th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues), moments of high art and excruciating noise produced comedy of a sophisticated kind.
This is the company's 13th year -- what it likes to call its bar mitzvah season -- and it presented a gala array of maimed excerpts from various operatic genres: the "Ride of the Valkyries," the closing trio from "Der Rosenkavalier," the duet of the title character and Arsace from "Semiramide," the St.
Sulpice scene from "Manon" and the entirety, more or less, of Act II of "Tosca." The evening's host was Sylvia Bills (Joe Simmons), "America's most beloved retired diva," expertly sending up the gala chitchat of Beverly Sills.

Why Bosnian Serbs Fear Hostile Muslim Rule
To the Editor:
I am writing less in reply to "Dr. Esma's Lesson" by Anthony Lewis (column, Nov. 21) than to the general view of the tragic conflict in Bosnia in his columns.
As a graduate student in European history I find his view of the Bosnian civil war simplistic and distorted.


Liberal Groups Banking on Republicans for Renewal
In an unusual consequence of Election Day's vast conservative shift, liberal interest groups are anticipating a period of prosperity.
The main reason, their leaders say, is that Newt Gingrich, in line to be the Speaker of the House, is an ideal fund-raising tool.
Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, Public Citizen and assorted environmental lobbying organizations say they are almost certain to receive sharp increases in donations as a result of the shift in Congress giving the Republicans majorities in both chambers for the first time since the 1950's.
The liberal groups expect increases in their memberships as well.


Ballet Hispanico Finds Its Essence
"Fifteen million Americans speak Spanish," reads a Ballet Hispanico poster in the lobby of the company's headquarters on West 89th Street in Manhattan.
"Their dance speaks for itself." And that has always been the quiet message of the troupe, founded in 1970 by Tina Ramirez.
The dances that will be performed by Ballet Hispanico during its two-week season at the Joyce Theater, where it opens tomorrow night, incorporate ethnic, jazz and modern dance as well as ballet.
But the five premieres -- by Alberto Alonso, Susan Marshall, Amanda Miller, Vicente Nebrada and Ramon Oller, a Catalan modern-dance choreographer new to New York -- are all set to Spanish music, ranging from songs by Gloria Estefan and Willie Colon to flamenco to Catalan songs sung by Marina Rossell.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; For marketers with a cause, a venture by A+ America comes up with some new twists.
A START-UP company with the intention of putting more computer and electronic technology into classrooms has pulled together a group of national sponsors to underwrite the effort.
Similar technology-for-school ventures relying on corporate support are already in place in many parts of the country.
But what sets apart the venture begun by A+ America Inc. is that it does not rely on a single sponsor or a retailer in a specific region.


Hard-Fought Ground
The conflict over the Muslim enclave of Bihac has demonstrated the enduring unity of Serbian purpose in establishing a single, contiguous homeland stretching from Belgrade through western Bosnia to the southern heartland of Croatia.
The battle for this small town in northwestern Bosnia has also shown that despite endless resolutions and contortions, the United Nations and NATO have found no effective means and no acceptable peace plan to combat this Serbian nationalist vision that lies at the heart of the current Balkan war.


Washington Memo; A Balanced Budget: What One Looked Like
In mid-January, the House of Representatives will vote on a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget.
It will be, said Newt Gingrich, "our first smashing victory" -- a safe political forecast.
But then what?
If the Senate also passes the amendment, and it is ratified by 38 states and eventually becomes part of the Constitution, can the budget actually be balanced by early in the next century, as the Republicans promise?
And can they do it, as they say they can, without raising taxes or touching Social Security and with cuts in the military budget that are much smaller than those President Clinton has proposed?


One Blitz Too Many Helps Bears Nip Cards
The entire state bought his rhetoric and the defense bought his playbook, but Buddy Ryan is about to renege on his promise.
He told anyone who would listen that the Arizona Cardinals were a playoff team, but today he called the wrong defense at the wrong time and lost his most critical game of the season in overtime.
The Chicago Bears, the team that made him famous, defeated the Cardinals, 19-16, after Ryan blitzed one time too many.
Facing a third-and-7 at its 35-yard line, Chicago picked up Ryan's rushing middle linebacker, Eric Hill, and quarterback Steve Walsh had what seemed like hours to locate Jeff Graham, his undeterred wide receiver, upfield.


A Crusader Adjusts to Life After Apartheid
Through each of her books and across the trajectory of her days, Nadine Gordimer has wrestled with her political surroundings, chronicling for outsiders the personal echoes of life in a racist society.
With apartheid finally ended, the novelist waxes exultant over a sense of renewal in her homeland; the urgency is gone, but the turn of mind remains.
Small surprise, then, that in delivering the Charles Eliot Norton Lecture series this semester at Harvard University, Ms.
Gordimer, a 70-year-old South African, is again combining political commitment with literary insight to focus on Naguib Mahfouz, Chinua Achebe and Amos Oz -- "absolutely wonderful writers" of the developing world who, she contends, have been virtually shut out of Western literary discourse.


The Classic And the Neo As Partners In Motion
George Balanchine at his most ebullient can also be Balanchine at his best, as two Saturday performances by the New York City Ballet proved again with debuts in "Symphony in C" and "Stars and Stripes."
The evening program at the New York State Theater also recalled a truism: it isn't easy to be a choreographer for the City Ballet when your works are virtually framed by Balanchine masterpieces.


Bratton to N.Y.P.D.: Smile When You Say That
Where are you, Emily Post, now that the Police Department needs you?
Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, who in the last year has demanded that average New York City police officers be more aggressive in pursuing their duties and has even given them new dark blue uniforms in keeping with the tough image, wants still more.


RESULTS PLUS
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL  UConn Wins Event a Fifth Straight Time  Rebecca Lobo scored 21 points and 12 rebounds in leading No. 3 Connecticut to a 92-59 victory over Rhode Island yesterday in the Hartford Courant Connecticut Classic Tournament.
Lobo earned most outstanding player honors for the third consecutive year.
She added seven assists and five blocks.
Connecticut (2-0), which earned its fifth straight tournament title, shot 53.4 percent from the floor and held the Rams to 29.3 percent shooting. (AP)


A Firestorm for a District Attorney; Hail of Accusations Against Him by Officials Stirs Up Suffolk
In January of last year, a call unlike any he had ever received came into the office of Patrick Mahoney, the Suffolk County Sheriff.
The Suffolk District Attorney, James M. Catterson Jr., was on the line.
As the sheriff tells it, Mr.
Catterson delivered a warning to a deputy: If Mr.
Mahoney did not butt out of the Katie Beers case -- a high-profile case involving the kidnapping of a 10-year-old girl -- Mr.
Catterson would arrest the sheriff and bring him before a grand jury.


Treasury To Sell Bills
The Treasury's schedule of financings this week is limited to today's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills.
By the close of the New York cash market on Friday, traders said, the rate on the outstanding three-month bill was 5.27 percent and on the six-month bill, 5.73 percent.

Beyond Rent Control
To the Editor:
Your Nov. 22 article about the Massachusetts referendum on the issue of rent control reports inaccurately the outcome of the vote: "Only Boston, Brookline and Cambridge voted -- in large numbers -- to keep rent control legal. The rest of the state voted to abolish it."


CONGRESS RETURNS TO SELECT LEADERS FOR THE NEW TERM
With Republicans eager to take charge in the first Congress they have controlled in 40 years, senators and representatives come back to town this week to choose the leaders who will set the legislative tone for the next two years.
Ideology is only minimally involved in the leadership fights.
The competition is more over styles, conciliatory versus combative.
But the legislative record of the 104th Congress may depend more on such mechanics than on the substance of any campaign promises.


Timorese Worry World Will Now Forget Them
This seems like a sleepy place, a dirt-poor region that the Asian economic miracle has left behind.
Goats and pigs wander along the roads.
Vendors in the open-air markets stack their potatoes and peppers in neat piles on the ground and snatch naps in the shade.
Children and adults alike greet the relatively rare Western visitor with "Hello Mister," which seems to be as much English as people know.
"To the normal visitor who spends a couple of days here, it's not obvious that there's something going on," a resident said.
"But if you stay a little longer, you see there is this resentment."


In Guatemala, a New Repression Reigns
To the Editor:
Coverage of the efforts of Jennifer Harbury, a United States citizen, to learn from the Guatemalan Government the truth about her husband, a Guatemalan guerrilla reportedly seen alive in the custody of the Guatemalan Government in a clandestine prison, has ignored the abandonment of constitutional democracy by the Government in power in Guatemala, which underlies a deteriorating human rights situation.
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio was appointed as President of Guatemala by a Congressional vote after an attempted Presidential coup by his predecessor failed; the President was never elected by the people.


New York Starts Spinning Its Dross into Gold
Last summer's empty containers for bleach, spring water, dish detergent, antifreeze, baby wipes, cat litter and motor oil have come back to New York streets this fall as traffic barricades.
Con Edison has ordered 25,000, all white.
The city has bought 3,200 sets of legs made from fabric-softener bottles, all light blue.
The barricades, made by Utility Plastic Recycling in East New York, Brooklyn, use only a small part of the 600 tons of plastic, glass and metal the city recycles every day, but they are a visible sign that the city's recycling program is finding new uses for millions of residential and commercial castaways.


Britain's Civil Liberties Backslide
Britain, sometimes romanticized as the mother of some American liberties, is dismantling its own safeguards against compelled self-incrimination -- at a time when "Miranda rights" seem to enjoy new respect in the United States.
For years British police have been warning arrested suspects: "You do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so, but what you say may be given in evidence." That seems fair enough, though not as informative as the U.S. version.


DANCE
2 Titles Promise Stories But Deliver Portraits  Joyce Theater
Despite its title, Garth Fagan's "Telling a Story" doesn't tell a story, at least not in the usual sense.
Instead, this two-part piece, to recordings by Miles Davis, is a portrait of determined people.
It received a forceful performance when Garth Fagan Dance offered it on Friday night at the Joyce Theater.


A Magazine Contest To Promote Chicago
To help rid Chicago of unflattering images like mobsters and freezing temperatures, Chicago magazine challenged seven local agencies to create print advertisements that promote the city's features to outsiders.
The results, in the magazine's December issue, show a decided tilt to the humorous.
The ad from the Chicago office of Hal Riney &amp; Partners, for example, featured an apple pie in the shape of the United States with the headline "Flaky on the outside, soft and warm in the middle." And the ad by McConnaughy Stein Schmidt Brown carried the headline: "A group of German tourists recently remarked that Chicago was the most beautiful city they'd seen since Paris in the 30's. Should we be worried?"


A Momentous Occasion for Giants' Brown
In the rain and cold, on a field that had all the traction of Silly Putty, Giants quarterback Dave Brown went through another one of his moments.
He has been through plenty of them.
There was the moment when, after the Giants' 3-0 start, he earned the respect of everyone around him.
There was the moment he was benched and his pride was bruised.
There was the moment last week when he lay on the ground, unconscious, for 30 seconds.
And there was today's moment.
It may turn out to be a big one for this season, for his career.
Or it may be a blip on the Brown radar screen.
This moment put Brown back in firmly as the starting quarterback of the Giants, and with the 21-19 victory over the Washington Redskins at R.F.K.
Stadium, it kept the team's slim playoff hopes alive.


A Generation Transformed -- A special report.; Women in Their 50's Follow Many Paths Into Workplace
They were members of the last generation to come of age before the women's movement took hold in the 1960's.
Marrying early and in huge numbers, they had expected not to work.
But their lives have played out much differently.
Women now in their 50's have piled into the work force in big numbers in the last decade and a half.
Today the college-educated among them are as likely to hold jobs as any group of younger women.


Breaking Barriers With Laughter
I confess, the prospect had me wincing.
Watching people with physical disabilities tell jokes doesn't exactly sound like a laugh riot.
But "Look Who's Laughing," an hourlong documentary tonight on PBS, artfully tweaks preconceptions with profiles of six professional comics whose physical disabilities are, to varying degrees, worked into routines that aim, as one puts it, to break down barriers and build bridges.
These particular handicaps are decidedly upfront.
The performers are Brett Leake, who has muscular dystrophy; Chris Fonseca and Geri Jewell, who have cerebral palsy; Kathy Buckley, who is hearing-impaired; Alex Valdez, who is blind, and J. D. England, who is paraplegic.
Their stories are told in clips that include performance samples and interviews.

Market Place; Tiffany's new sparkle is seen in the eyes of investors.
WHEN Holly Golightly, the ingenue in "Breakfast at Tiffany's," was sad, she would walk through the Tiffany &amp; Company store on Fifth Avenue and the sight of jewels, crystal and silver would cheer her up.
Investors are finding that Tiffany is making them happy, too.
In less than a month, Tiffany shares rose 20 percent -- and there may be a little more upside yet to come.
After suffering in the early 1990's from sagging earnings, Tiffany has begun to turn around.
The end of the recession was good news as customers began to spend more.
Problems at Tiffany's Japanese outlets, which account for more than 25 percent of sales, have been straightened out.
And a rapid expansion in stores, which dampened earnings in the early 1990's, has paid off as those stores have now begun to fill with shoppers.


You Can't Even Trust a Postage Stamp

The Postal Service made more egregious errors in its "Legends of the West" series than depicting Bill Pickett's brother, rather than the rodeo legend himself, on the stamp (news article, Nov. 20).


METRO DIGEST
NEW YORK CITY SPINS ITS DROSS INTO GOLD
While collection is the most visible and expensive part of New York City's recycling program, officials say it is the reuse of those items -- as everything from traffic barricades to fishing piers -- that justifies the effort and may someday underwrite its cost, now $77 million a year for pickup and processing.
And beyond creating new ways to use old materials, recycling is also creating jobs.
In fact, New York's growing supplies of materials, combined with strong foreign and domestic markets, have spurred the establishment and expansion of so many private processing plants that the city, which contracts with 14 different companies, has all but abandoned a plan to build five city-owned plants.

A Sign of the Season


A Smooth Brazilian Blend
Marisa Monte, an exceptionally sophisticated and engaging pop singer from Brazil, exemplifies the quality in Brazilian music that might be called its all-inclusiveness.
Ms.
Monte, who appeared at the Supper Club on Monday and Wednesday evenings, is only in her mid-20's.
But in common with the most talented Brazilian performers, she displays a masterly blend of disparate elements.
In stirring many different echoes into a personal style that seems utterly uncontrived, Ms.
Monte, who was supported by a superb seven-member band, is a descendant of such Brazilian musical titans as Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso.
Aside from the fact that she writes only a small portion of her material, what distinguishes her from her forerunners is a more modernist taste in pop ingredients.


New Campaigns
*
Fortune magazine, New York, is changing themes in a campaign in newspapers and trade publications.
The campaign, by Ogilvy &amp; Mather New York, carries the theme "Put it to work," replacing a theme, "Inside the mind of management," which has run since 1988.
The campaign is aimed at readers and business executives as well as advertising decision-makers.
Spending is estimated at more than $2 million.


Harry Abrams Is Dead at 87; Ran Across the Country Twice
Harry Abrams, who twice ran between Los Angeles and New York City in the late 1920's, died yesterday in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.
He was 87.
Mr. Abrams discovered he had a brain tumor two months ago, said Dale Adams, a daughter.


On the Right Track
Thirty-one years ago, the shattered marble, travertine and granite columns, caryatids, gods and eagles of Penn Station -- modeled after the monuments of ancient Rome by McKim, Mead and White and built for eternity in 1910 -- were carted off to the Secaucus meadows, giving New Jersey undisputed title to the world's most elegant dump.
Of the eagles that crowned the station's walls, a few tokens were reinstalled in front of the new Madison Square Garden, making the contrast between classical and cheesy terminally (pun intended) clear.
Because what goes around comes around, usually so that you want to laugh or cry, there are plans for a new Penn Station.
The proposal is part of a program in which all of the facilities for Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Railroad will be coordinated for what is now fashionably called intermodal transportation but looks more like a railroad revival and great train station renaissance.


Marino Is at His Best When the Clock is Racing
The Dolphins were trailing, 24-21, and had a first-and-goal from the 8 with 30 seconds to play yesterday when Dan Marino gave a knowing glance to Mark Ingram, who had lined up wide to the right.
Marino, yelling "Clock! Clock! Clock!" made a spiking motion to the ground with his right hand and the deceptive die was cast.
There were 75,606 fans at Giants Stadium.
How could they know what was coming next when the 9 other Dolphin players on the team didn't even know?
The unsuspecting Jets relaxed, thinking Marino was going to spike the ball into the ground to stop the clock.
Instead, Marino fired a dart past Jets cornerback Aaron Glenn right into the stomach of Ingram for a touchdown.

Take a Realistic Look at Some of These Women on Welfare
To the Editor:
Congress and some of the people it represents must have got the idea somewhere that poor women and their children are using too many tax dollars, that their families are too large, they're having too many children, they don't want to work, and they are living comfortable lives off the rest of us out of laziness.


Colombo Journal; A Nonfiction Journey to a More Peaceful World
When the dean of science fiction writers, Arthur C. Clarke, explains why he chose to move to this island nation off the southern tip of India almost 40 years ago, he says he craved the peace that would have escaped him in his native Britain or in the United States.
"If I had lived in New York or London, I'd be eaten alive," said the 76-year-old Mr.
Clarke, who is the author of more than 80 books and many short stories and scripts, including the Oscar-winning screenplay he wrote with Stanley Kubrick for "2001: A Space Odyssey."

2 Gunmen Invade A Church Service
Disrupting a church service in East New York yesterday, two men wearing masks and brandishing guns forced about 100 churchgoers to the floor and robbed six women before fleeing, the police said.
The robbery, in which no one was injured, occurred about 1:45 P.M. at the Holy Cross Remnant Church of Jesus Apostolic, at 645 Hegeman Avenue.
After entering, the two intruders fired once at the ceiling, the Rev.
W.
B.
McNeil said.


Editorial Notebook; Undemocratic Vistas
What caused the Holocaust?
Was it Fascism, ushered in by the collapse of the Weimar Republic?
Was it that Germanic fixation on racial superiority and "purity"?
Or was it the Enlightenment and those dirty rotten idealists, Hobbes, Rousseau, Franklin and Jefferson?
Blame the Enlightenment and you've chosen the right villain -- at least in the eyes of Leo Strauss, the political philosopher who held court at the University of Chicago through the 1950's and 60's.
Strauss's students had to gasp when he said that Hitler had sprung full blown from the Enlightenment presumptions that all people were created equal and that society was better governed by reason than slavish devotion to tradition.
Leo Strauss contended that the Philosopher Kings (himself included) were born to rule, servants were born to serve and that only disaster came of letting the rabble get above its station.

Abroad at Home; The End of NATO?
For four decades the North Atlantic Treaty Organization kept the peace in Europe.
It was an extraordinary achievement of trans-Atlantic cooperation.

Volleying Over Budget Is Heating Up
The battle between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council for primacy over the city's budget grew more heated yesterday as the Giuliani administration asserted that the Council's spending plan would leave the city budget $100 million out of balance.
Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers said yesterday that cuts Council sought in the number of employees in the Mayor's finance office and in the sheriff's department would reduce revenue because of slower processing and collection of city taxes and fines for parking tickets.


Pataki Ally Carves Niche In New Republican Order
In Joseph L. Bruno, in line to become the new majority leader of the State Senate, voters will hear a more conservative voice in state government than they are used to, from a man who says he will question everything from welfare to environmental regulations in the name of cutting spending and taxes.
But in an interview yesterday, he sought to send messages of both conciliation to New York City, concerned that it might bear the brunt of spending cuts, and determination to carry out what he sees as the fiscal mandate of his fellow Republican, Governor-elect George E. Pataki, a colleague in the Senate.

Virtual Literacy With Illustrated Holiday Books
Let us then for a moment think of books as rest stops along the info-superhighway, places to calm our eyes, flush out our synapses and take our brains for a stroll through the Gutenberg gardens.
The following works, arranged roughly in order of increasing price, seem especially well-appointed places to luxuriate in this holiday season.
THE FRENCH CAFE.
By Marie-France Boyer.
Photographs by Eric Morin. (120 pages. Thames &amp; Hudson. $19.95.) The fun of this witty and instructive volume is immediately apparent in the two-page montage of waiters' black vests that appears near its opening.
From artists' haunts to workers' hangouts, you can almost taste the coffee and croissants.
Includes a guide to the best cafes all over France.


Free Trade and Job Losses
Almost 1,500 jobs in the region have been lost as a direct result of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect Jan. 1, according to the Labor Department.
New York State has seen about 10 percent of the job losses attributed to the accord nationwide.
In general, trade experts credit the strong domestic economy with holding down the job losses in the United States.
Workers who lose their jobs because of the free-trade agreement can receive benefits under the Labor Department's Transitional Adjustment Assisitance Program.
It provides re-employment services, job training and income support beyond unemployment benfits.


Corrections
The main front-page article on Nov. 10 about the Republicans' sweep in the elections referred incorrectly to the experience of Congress members under previous Republican control of the House, in 1955.
One member, Representative Sidney R. Yates, Democrat of Illinois, indeed served at that time, though his service has not been continuous.


RECORDINGS
An Eccentric Wit Scampers In His Idiosyncratic World  Benedict Mason (Bridge, BCD 9045; CD)
Bridge Records gravitates toward the more eccentric and self-determined figures in contemporary music.
Its latest find is the fairly unknown but greatly gifted English composer Benedict Mason, who writes music of deep complexity and high wit.
He is a mysterious figure, now 40, who seems to have turned to composition full time only in the last six or seven years.
He studied with Gyorgy Ligeti and plainly echoes that composer's current blend of textural intricacy and stylistic playfulness.
Otherwise, he inhabits a world very much his own: fiendishly intricate rhythmic patterns, ear-teasing historical allusions, hallucinatory hints of tonal clarity.


Serbs' Gains Irreversible, Perry Asserts
Defense Secretary William J. Perry said today that the Bosnian Serbs had demonstrated their superiority on the battlefield and that the Muslim-led Bosnian Government would be unable to reverse their gains even if NATO warplanes came to its aid.
"The Serbs have occupied 70 percent of the country," Mr.
Perry said.
"There's no prospect, as I see it, of the Muslims' winning that back."


Patents; A Court Ruling Extends Burroughs-Wellcome's Monopoly on the AIDS drug AZT
IN a ruling that is expected to establish an important precedent for the biotechnology industry, the nation's highest patent court last week rejected a bid by two companies to sell a cheaper generic version of the potent AIDS drug AZT.
The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit appears to put to rest the long tussle between the Burroughs-Wellcome Company and the National Institutes of Health over who should be given credit for developing AZT.


Essay; Robust Or Bust
Sir Michael Rose, the reincarnation of Neville Chamberlain, has just admitted that his U.N. force of 23,000 Europeans is unable to "deter" Bosnian Serbs from destroying cities the Security Council has established as safe havens.
That is tantamount to surrender.
A ragtag splinter group of Serbians, with no power but the weaponry and willingness to kill civilians, has rendered the poseurs and pontificators of the United Nations helpless and contemptible.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Press Notes; Newspapers Opt for Teamwork in a Campaign to Offer Advertisers One-stop Shopping
LAST week, as you may have noticed from those full-page ads in your local paper, was a big week for the American newspaper industry.
After talking about it for nearly a generation, the industry now has a single advertising sales force that can represent virtually every newspaper in the country in an effort to win national advertising from makers of such products as automobiles, cosmetics and household goods.
The ads last week, which ran in big papers like The Chicago Tribune and small ones like The Foothills Sentinel in Cave Creek, Ariz., announced that something newspaper executives call the N.N.N. was open for business.


Military Town Opening Doors As Base Closes
It was the memory of a weed-savaged tarmac and boarded-up buildings at an abandoned military base elsewhere that galvanized James L. Meyer in 1990 when word floated in from Washington that the local Air Force base here, the region's largest employer, was likely to close.
"I remember walking around there and it was so sad," said Mr.
Meyer, referring to a military base in Lake Charles, La.
No one was sure that the base in Alexandria would in fact be shuttered.
But "I said, 'We have to make a contingency plan here or we're doomed.' " Mr.
Meyer recalled.

NEWS SUMMARY
International A3-11  BATTLE FOR 'GREATER SERBIA'
News analysis: The battle for Bihac has demonstrated the Serbian will to establish a "Greater Serbia." It has also shown that the U.N. and NATO have failed to combat the Serbs' nationalist vision.

Hynes to Convene Grand Jury On Kingsboro Security Lapses
The Brooklyn District Attorney said yesterday that he would convene a grand jury early this week to investigate security lapses and allegations of financial mismanagement at the Kingsboro State Psychiatric Center in Flatbush.
"Very clearly, there is a security problem, given the breaches of the past 10 days," said the district attorney, Charles J. Hynes.


4 Are Charged After Drug Raid on Queens 'Stash House'
At first glance, there appeared to be nothing unusual about the two-story, tan brick, semi-attached house at 254-17 60th Avenue in Little Neck.
Despite being a multifamily dwelling, it otherwise blended in with the one-family houses along the street that, with its neatly trimmed hedges, mowed lawns and numerous trees, looked as if it belonged in the suburbs rather than Queens.
Among the tenants were a young couple and two small children in the second-floor apartment, described by neighbors as a regular family on a quiet street in a well-to-do neighborhood.


PRO FOOTBALL: Sports of The Times; Could Esiason's Sideline Scuffle Have Melted His Cool?
WHEN the Jets were leading, 17-0, the record 75,606 spectators were chanting, "J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets," but now they were standing in silence.
And in fear.
With the final seconds flashing on the scoreboard, the Dolphins had rallied to 24-21 and Dan Marino was drilling the Jets' defense with passes.
For the Jets and their frustrated followers, the game was on the line.
So was the Jets' new image.
So, possibly, was the Jets' season, if not a berth in the Super Bowl XXIX playoffs.

Nets Glimpse a What-If And a What Might Be
Just as the notion of knocking off the Phoenix Suns became tangible, just as this four-game road swing was beginning to look delectable, the Nets swallowed hard tonight, and cautiously pondered their immediate future at a crucial position.
The shooting guard they could have had in the June draft, Wesley Person of Auburn, showed off his offensive talents, scoring a career-high 26 points.
The shooting guard who starts for them, Kevin Edwards, suffered a strain in his left calf that may keep him out of action for the next week.


Anti-Official Art That Survived The Iron Curtain
In 1984, when the hand of Government censorship lay heavy on art in Czechoslovakia, Joska Skalnik, a graphic designer and longtime troublemaker, came up with a very Czech idea.
If unofficial artists could not exhibit, why not create an unofficial salon?
The work could not be exhibited, of course.
But it would exist, and its mere existence would be intensely annoying to the nation's cultural overlords.
Mr.
Skalnik invited each of about 300 artists to accept delivery of a lidless wooden box 6 inches square and 2 inches deep.
The assignment was to create a work of art within the box.
The completed work was to be returned to Mr.
Skalnik.
In all, 244 artists took part in what Mr.
Skalnik called the Minisalon.
The boxes were collected, then hidden in a shed outside Prague.
There they remained until 1989, when the velvet revolution brought down the Communist regime.


Shuler Seeks Positives In a Learning Season
The Washington Redskins, once dominant at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium, lost their eighth game in a row here today, 21-19, to the Giants.
But the coach and the quarterback expected to lead this team back to respectability saw progress, even if it came in baby steps.
Heath Shuler was back at the helm for Washington, a team that has split the time at quarterback among Shuler, Gus Frerotte and John Friesz.
Shuler, the rookie from the University of Tennessee, showed promise, but it was sandwiched around shakiness.
His final statistics -- 11 of 28 for 165 yards and 1 interception -- were certainly nothing to rave about.
Nevertheless, Shuler and Coach Norv Turner said they saw some positive signs.


Who Needs Mean Joe Greene Anyway?
Steelers 21, Raiders 3
Remember Pittsburgh's "Steel Curtain" defense of the mid-70's?
It seems the Steelers have revived it for the mid-90's.
Pittsburgh's defense held the Raiders to one field goal and Mike Tomczak threw two touchdown passes as the Steelers beat up Los Angeles, 21-3, yesterday.


Bane of Insurers: New Ailments
Companies that sell disability insurance to individuals are reporting a sharp rise in claims for certain ailments that were little known 10 years ago, leaving the insurers with losses of hundreds of millions of dollars.
The companies are also reporting a big increase in claims by doctors, once among the most prized of the insurance industry's clients.
In response, insurers are adopting new strategies, from offering less generous benefits to pulling out of the business.
Three million people, many of them self-employed, are covered by individual disability policies that generate annual revenues for insurers of $3.5 billion.
Group disability policies offered through employers cover 48 million more people, and offer more limited benefits.


Bridge
The defending champions led a field of 10 strong teams into the two final sessions of the Reisinger Board-a-Match Team Championship at the conclusion of the American Contract Bridge League's Fall Nationals here this afternoon.
Nick Nickell of Raleigh, N.C., Richard Freeman of Atlanta, Jeff Meckstroth of Tampa, Fla., Eric Rodwell of Napersville, Ill., Bob Wolff and Bob Hamman, both of Dallas, who won a year ago in Seattle, had a small lead over the same team that finished second there.
The qualifiers by captain were: 1st Nickell team, 40.86 boards; 2d, James Cayne of Manhattan, 40.31; 3d, Richard Schwartz of East Elmhurst, N.Y., 37.89; 4th, Joseph Silver of Hampstead, Quebec, 36.1; 5th, Andy Goodman of San Francisco, 34.79; 6th, Eddie Kantar of Santa Monica, Calif., 34.39; 7th, Bob Crossley of Greenbrae, Calif., 33.09; 8th, Michael Moss of Manhattan, 33.08; 9th, Ron Rubin of North Miami, Fla., 32.79; 10th, Steve Weinstein of Glen Ridge, N.J., 32.63.


A City Pulls Its School Board Back to the Center
In 1992 the religious right established a beachhead in this small Southern California city, winning control of the local school board after a rough-and-tumble campaign that included many of the issues that now top the national agenda.
The usual work of a school board then took a back seat as its 3-to-2 conservative majority fought to limit sex education, promote the teaching of creationism, curtail breakfast programs financed by the government and reintroduce prayer to the school system.

"It used to be that a woman's mental health, having peaked in her 20's, declined drastically after age 40. But today the mental health of women in their 50's is as good as, or better than, that of women in their 20's and 30's." -- BETTY FRIEDAN.  [ A1:5. ]


Retailers Cautiously Optimistic
Heavy advertising and promotional campaigns helped draw shoppers into stores during the weekend, and several retailers reported that their sales in the first two days of the holiday shopping season were slightly better than expected.
But most executives were circumspect about business, and one survey of foot traffic in 33 malls around the country found fewer shoppers this year than last year for the first weekend of holiday shopping.


Bosnia Accepts U.N. Plan For Truce in the Northwest
Bosnia tonight accepted a United Nations plan for a cease-fire around the northwestern town of Bihac, which has been under attack by Serbs for more than a week.
The Serbs, from Bosnia and Croatia, renewed heavy artillery and infantry attacks today around Bihac, which was designated a safe area by the United Nations.
The Serbs were attacking Izacic and other villages just beyond the northwestern edge of the Bihac safe area, United Nations officials said.


Israeli Tourists Get New View of Promised Land
For years, during stints of reserve duty in the Israeli Army, Jacob Geva spent long hours patrolling the border between Israel and Jordan, riding along a frontier blocked by mines and an electronic fence.
This week, Mr.

Ingram's Career Day Not Just Touchdowns
Clutching the ball he had caught for the winning touchdown as if it were an early Christmas present, Mark Ingram was asked if he could remember the last time he had a game like the one he had against the Jets today.
"Little league, pee wees, flag football, I don't know," the Dolphins flanker said en route to the team bus.


Europe Awaiting U.S. Moves on Trade Pact
The likelihood that Congress will ratify the new world trade agreement this week should encourage approval of the pact by important trading partners like France in coming weeks.
But lingering questions about whether the United States is seeking special treatment could complicate the process, diplomats and trade officials in Europe said.
Most European legislatures have been waiting to see if the United States would ratify the accord before taking up the issue themselves, and several trade officials now say they are optimistic that all of the biggest signers to the agreement, in Europe and around the world, would approve it by the end of the year.


Leading Dissident Writer in Iran Dies After 8 Months in Detention
The leading dissident writer in Iran died today in detention, eight months after being charged with drug abuse and espionage.
Iranian authorities said the cause was a heart attack.
The author, Ali Akbar Saidi Sirjani, 63, was arrested last March and was not allowed to have a defense attorney or a trial.
He was the author of more than 15 books on Iranian history and legend, many of them best-sellers, in which he analyzed the differences between Iran's distinct heritage and Islamic cultures.
His contention that Iranians had a pre-Islamic tradition of respect for individual rights and of fighting tyranny led to the banning of his books in 1991.


Run-and-Shoot Falcons Find Better Way to Win
It is the National Football Conference East that is known for power football and ball control.
Those N.F.C.
West teams tinker here, toss it there, finesse you to death.
That, at least, is how the myth, the reputations, go.
Philadelphia (N.F.C. East) versus Atlanta (N.F.C. West) this afternoon in the Georgia Dome was supposed to be one of those kinds of games, but the Falcons pulled a surprise.
Atlanta ran more plays than Philadelphia (72 to 55).
The Falcons had the ball nearly 13 minutes longer.
The Run-and-Shoot Falcons even ran the ball more than the Eagles (24 to 14).

CLASSICAL MUSIC
Props Fail to Cooperate With 'Mtsensk's' 2d String  Metropolitan Opera
There were few problems in the performance of Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk" on Saturday afternoon, with second-stringers in the main roles, that a better production wouldn't fix.
But such is unlikely anytime soon, since it took the work 60 years to reach the Met in the first place.


Larger Than Life Versus Smaller
Waiting for Leporello: the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Mozart's "Don Giovanni" reached its third performance on Friday evening, still without Bryn Terfel in the cast.
Mr.
Terfel, the young Welsh bass who has riveted the attention of the New York music world this fall by meeting just some of the impossibly high expectations placed upon him in the Met's "Nozze di Figaro" and in recital, injured his back in the dress rehearsal for "Don Giovanni." The Met now says the earliest he could appear is Dec. 6.
He is missed, for the staging of "Don Giovanni" needs every larger-than-life figure it can get.
Franco Zeffirelli's production originated in 1990, and was last presented three seasons ago.
Mr.
Zeffirelli also designed the sets, and they are monumental (of course).

NBC Grabs Young Adults From ABC
NBC has yet to label itself the network that drives families apart, but in a strategic sense that is exactly what it has become -- to its significant profit.
The network has made some big gains this television season by grabbing young adult viewers away from ABC, the leading network in prime time, and has even put a dent in what has always been a stronghold for ABC: 8 P.M. programs.


CHRONICLE
As far as ISAIAH SHEFFER is concerned, Symphony Space might as well be on the Left Bank as on the Upper West Side, so thoroughly has he dipped it into French culture this season.
"Symphony Space has turned into 'Symphonie Fantastique,' " Mr.
Sheffer, the artistic director of the center for performing arts, said the other day.
In addition to a nine-week retrospective of Louis Malle films now going on, Mr.
Sheffer has planned for next month what he describes as "a weekend devoted to French love in letters, poetry, song and cinema."


A Scholar's Memoirs Raise Some Ghosts at Oxford
The sentence could have been written by Poe or Dostoyevsky, the way it summons the unspeakable in a coldly confessional tone: "But it was clear to me by now that Trevor and the college must somehow be separated. My problem was one which I feel compelled to define with brutal candor: how to kill him without getting into trouble."
The words were not written by a poet trawling the depths of the subconscious, and they are not fiction.
They are from a newly published autobiography of Sir Kenneth Dover, one of the world's most renowned classicists.
And they describe a series of events that preceded the suicide of a troublesome colleague at Oxford nine years ago.


Executive Changes
SPRINT INTERNATIONAL, Kansas City, Mo., said Paolo L. Guidi had resigned as its president to pursue other interests.
He will be succeeded by Christopher J. Rooney, the president of business operations for Sprint's long-distance division.
STROH BREWERY CO., Detroit, promoted William L. Henry, president and chief operating officer, to chief executive, succeeding Peter W. Stroh, who continues as chairman of Stroh Brewery Co. and as chairman and chief executive of Stroh Cos.


Half a Policy on Iraq
There are two ways to contain Iraq.
One, as the Clinton Administration recently demonstrated, is to deter war.
The other, which it has neglected, is to encourage moves toward peace.
Yet Washington refuses to acknowledge Iraq's progress on arms control -- a serious and potentially dangerous mistake.
It may be good domestic politics, but it poorly serves America's international interests.
Refusing to recognize positive Iraqi moves discourages further cooperation and drives a wedge between America and other members of the U.N.
Security Council.
Baghdad seriously damaged its credibility last month by staging menacing military maneuvers near Kuwait.
After that ploy backfired, Iraq reversed course and recognized Kuwait's sovereignty and borders.
But its earlier threats devalued that concession; Iraq must now firm up its assurances that it will never again engage in such provocative conduct toward its neighbors by agreeing to restrict its troop movements, give advance notice of future exercises and admit outside observers.

New York Civics Lesson: No Mayor Stands Alone
MAYOR Rudolph W. Giuliani has become an involuntary enrollee in that most basic of civics courses, the one that teaches mayors that they cannot go it alone.
They either get along with the governor, legislative leaders and the City Council Speaker or, after riding high in the headlines and the polls for a while, they get into trouble.
As a Federal prosecutor all those years, Mr.
Giuliani could do pretty much as he liked.
Add his strong will and temper to his curriculum vitae and the result is a mayor at odds with many whose cooperation he needs, from the Governor-elect to the latest Giuliani combatant, City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone.


RECORDINGS
From Revueltas, Subtle Irony And a Bloody Uprising Night of the Mayas (Catalyst, 09026-62672-2; CD)
Silvestre Revueltas, who died in 1940, was not merely the greatest composer Mexico has produced; he now appears to have been one of the most original and compelling figures in all of 20th-century music.
His art was distinctive in a number of ways: as a visceral, populist extension of modernist techniques; as a revolutionary fusion of classical and pop idioms, and as a singular instance of a raw, ungovernable talent who composed actively only in the last decade of his short life and mastered whatever genre lay before him.

Jersey City Weighs Effect Of Vouchers For Schools
On school vouchers, the big players in New Jersey do not equivocate.
For the Governor, the Jersey City Mayor, the state teachers' union, vouchers are either all good or all bad, apple-pie American or unconstitutional, the coming salvation or the potential destruction of this city's flagging public schools.
But here on the ground in Jersey City, whose Mayor wants to make it a proving ground for the state's first voucher program, the feelings are much more ambivalent -- even among the parents of Catholic school students who might stand to benefit financially from the plan.


THEATER
Turning to Sex for Laughs In the London of 1675  Bouwerie Lane Theater
It is always ominous when the program lists the time as "not so long ago" and the place as "not so far away" for a 1675 play set in London.
It usually means the director has been free-associating with the text.
In the Jean Cocteau Repertory's contemporary staging of William Wycherley's "Country Wife," the director is Tori Haring-Smith and she turns bawdy satire into burlesque.


The Starks Cure for Slump: Practice, Practice, Practice
More than an hour after the Knicks finished practicing today, John Starks was still on the floor, shooting one jump shot after another over a broom held up by Assistant Coach Jeff Van Gundy.
The idea behind the broom was to simulate the long arms of defenders who get in Starks's face whenever he launches a shot.
The idea behind the overtime was to help Starks snap out of his recent shooting funk.


So Much Perfection. So Who's Champion?
You are from Penn State, and you have every answer you need to know that the Nittany Lions have earned the right to play for a national championship in the Rose Bowl.

Effort to Sell or Lease Nassau Medical Center Stumbles
The effort to sell or lease the Nassau County Medical Center to private operators is off to a doubtful start, and some officials say it may die a slow death.
Although some health-industry experts say that private management of the medical center, Long Island's largest public hospital, is an idea whose time has come, resistance is growing and bidders complain that the county's requirements make privatization almost impossible.


Dividend Meetings


CHRONICLE
ABE HIRSCHFELD turns 75 on Dec. 13, but he says he will observe the milestone tonight because he always celebrates his birthday on the second night of Hanukkah.
"I was born on the second night of Hanukkah and I have an old friend, Meshulam Riklis, who has the same birthday," he said, referring to the financier.
"About 30 years ago, his mother began making a Hanukkah birthday party for us and that lasted until she passed away about 10 years ago."


Bitter Feud Is Dividing Sandinistas
Beneath the single, flickering bulb in his medical examination room, Dr.
Rommel Martinez Cabeza spoke over the din from the street a few feet away.
"After all the deaths we suffered and we caused, and after all we thought we had achieved, I find myself again in the business of subversion," he said.
For Dr.
Martinez it is the most painful sort of subversion.
He is working to undermine an organization he says he used to believe was as necessary as the medical profession: the Sandinista National Liberation Front.

As Envoy, Crowe, the Old Sailor, Navigates Rough Sea
For someone who has logged 47 years in the military and become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff through a combination of intelligence and shrewdness, William J. Crowe Jr., the Ambassador to Britain, would seem to be the right man in the right place at the right time.
Ambassador Crowe took up his first diplomatic post six months ago, a time when differences over the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina began to strain American-British relations and raise fundamental questions about the performance and purpose of NATO, which was deploying forces outside its treaty area for the first time.

The Spike Was a Fake, but the Damage to Jets' Season Is Real
There were no secrets today.
The largest home crowd in Jets history knew what would be happening in those wild final minutes, and so did the Jets.
Dan Marino would be winging that ball.

Giuliani Tells Agencies to Use His Budget, Not the Council's
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday instructed city agencies to implement his budget proposals and disregard the City Council's, even as the Comptroller warned that the dispute could hurt the city's fiscal standing.
"The failure to resolve this matter could have costs beyond the institutional battle," Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said.
"Agencies don't know if they are getting reimbursed for the services they provide. And a protracted dispute displays that our financial credibility is in question, which could lead to a downgrading of our credit rating."

U.S. Drops Effort to Oust a Gay Sailor
The Clinton Administration said today that it would drop its effort to bar a homosexual from serving in the Navy and would not appeal the case to the United States Supreme Court.
Government lawyers insisted that their decision in the case of Petty Officer Keith Meinhold was not intended to convey the message that the military must admit homosexuals.
Rather, they said, it was simply a tactical decision in the long-running court battle between the armed services and gay and civil rights groups over the Pentagon's policy on homosexuality.


Cairo Journal; In the Slums, a Tug-of-War for Hearts and Minds
Sheik Mohammed Ali, a militant Islamic leader, sat in a dimly lighted room in a second-floor apartment and thumbed through a stack of letters.

A Growing Rage in Bay Ridge; Change Breeds Violence in a Once-Quiet Corner of Brooklyn
David O'Connor describes his father's occupation as "drinker." He says that the man exited his life by his second birthday and that his mother, a diner waitress, let him take to the streets of Brooklyn at age 14.
Now 15, he sleeps in a small bedroom in a group home.
He has been arrested once, charged with stealing a car, and is described by administrators at Telecommunications High School in Bay Ridge as a troubled student.
Born to an Irish Catholic family, he says he has no great use for religion.


COURT TO WEIGH 2 SEARCH CASES
Marking its current term as potentially the most important in years for the constitutional law of search and seizure, the Supreme Court today accepted two cases posing long-unresolved questions about drug testing and police searches.
One case asks whether public schools can subject students to random drug tests.
The other asks whether in executing a search warrant police officers must first announce their presence and give the occupant time to open the door before forcing their way inside.


Soulima Stravinsky, Composer, Pianist And Educator, 84
Soulima Stravinsky, a composer, pianist and the youngest son of Igor Stravinsky, died yesterday at the Emerald Oaks Nursing Home in Sarasota, Fla.
He was 84.
The cause was respiratory failure after a long illness, said his son, John.


A Piano Recital Program With a Difference
Justin Kolb's piano recital on Sunday afternoon at Weill Recital Hall took a sharp swerve at intermission that might have thrown a few people overboard.
On the first half, Liszt's arrangement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony; on the second half, music by the Viennese-born American composer Robert Starer.
The pianist's exuberance and confident attack on the keyboard tied his unusual program together.
Mr.
Starer celebrates his 70th birthday this year.
When the history books are written, he will probably land somewhere in the great open middle of American compositional tradition.
His language is sometimes dissonant and even 12-tone in orientation, but it is fundamentally consonant beneath the surface, and his liking for open intervals puts him a shade close to Copland than, say, to Elliott Carter.
Among other qualities, he has a certifiable gift for melody.
Mr.
Kolb gave the world premiere of his Sonata No. 3, an unpretentious but possibly overlong work in three movements.
He also played numerous shorter pieces, among them the "Sketches in Color" familiar to many piano students.


UNUM UNABLE TO REACH REINSURANCE ACCORD
The UNUM Corporation of Portland, Me., said yesterday that it had been unable to agree with another insurance company, whose identity it did not disclose, to reinsure UNUM's existing individual disability insurance.
Earlier this month, when UNUM announced an increase of $192 million, before taxes, in reserves for that business, it said it would seek a reinsurance policy to protect it from additional losses.
The chairman of UNUM, James F. Orr 3d, said the reinsurance was not purchased because its price was too high.
He said the company would proceed with plans to introduce new individual disability policies that it expected would be less risky to the insurance company.
Shares of UNUM rose $1.25, to $38, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.


Priscilla Morrill, Actress, 67
Priscilla Morrill, a stage and television actress, died on Nov. 9 at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles.

Astronomy Crisis Deepens As the Hubble Telescope Sees No Missing Mass
IN their audacious reach for understanding of the universe, cosmologists often draw back hands that are maddeningly empty.
They know, for example, there is more out there than meets the eye.
But hard as they try, they are unable to grasp the nature of what lurks in the blackness enfolding the luminous stars and galaxies, that shadowy substance whose gravitational pull must be the organizing force for the evolution and overall structure of the universe.
The abundance of this invisible mass, whatever it is, could dictate the fate of the universe.
Unless there is more mass than scientists so far have been able to measure or infer, that fate would appear to be bleak indeed.


Let Police Run Shelters
To the Editor:
You report that the New York City Police Department's new Homeless Outreach Unit has encountered many problems ("Police Reach Out to the Homeless, but Often Find Efforts Rejected," front page, Nov. 16).
Why not have the police, who take the homeless to shelters, instead supervise the shelters?
I am sure that many of the homeless, who now fear for their lives in the shelters, would more readily go to them if they knew that someone was protecting them.

Tiffany Told to Pay for Sexual Harassment
A former head of the estate jewelry department at Tiffany &amp; Company was awarded $365,000 by the New York State Division of Human Rights yesterday after she charged she had been sexually harassed by two superiors at the store and then dismissed when she complained.
Lawrence Wizman, a division spokesman, said $300,000 of the award was for mental anguish, the largest such award ever given by the division in a sexual harassment case.
The other $65,000 was for back pay and interest in the case, which dates to the early 1980's.


N.F.L. May Consider Using a Penalty Box
As a way to curb some of the flagrant violence in the National Football League, at least one team has asked the competition committee to study the use of a penalty box -- similar to the one used by the National Hockey League -- for players who deliver dangerous hits to a quarterback.
Greg Aiello, the N.F.L. director of communication, confirmed that the proposal had been made.
Aiello said it had been discussed by the competition committee in the past, but it has never made it out of the committee for a discussion by the team owners.
He said he did not know the specifics of the latest proposal and would not say which team has made the proposal.


Observer; 'Bunk,' Ford Called It
Political intellectuals are having a nasty argument about what history should be taught to American schoolchildren.
Tales you hear indicate that, whatever history may be taught in the future, at present kids learn practically none of any kind.
My own favorite anecdote stars an apparently normal high school student.
Amazed to hear a graybeard refer to the First World War, he cried, "I never knew there was a First World War!"


ABC Deal To Share Revenues
Capital Cities/ABC Inc. agreed yesterday to form a television production company with the powerful Hollywood team of Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen.
The venture will be the television industry's first in which a broadcast network intends to share advertising income and other revenue with an outside producer.


Neuheisel Gets the Job
RICK NEUHEISEL, an assistant football coach at the University of Colorado, was hired as the school's head coach, replacing BILL McCARTNEY.
"I believe truly no one has more capability to lead this team to new success than Rick Neuheisel," said the university president, JUDITH ALBINO.


In Furor Over Prize, Novelist Speaks Up For His Language
No sooner had James Kelman's novel "How Late It Was, How Late" won this year's Booker Prize for fiction than a full-scale furor erupted.
One of the judges, Rabbi Julia Neuberger, declared that the book was unreadably bad and said that the awarding of the prize, Britain's most important, was a "disgrace." Simon Jenkins, a conservative columnist for The Times of London, called the award "literary vandalism." Several other critics sniped that the book should have been disqualified because of its heavy use of profanity.
Meanwhile, the British literary establishment huddled together defensively as Mr.
Kelman appeared in a business suit at the black-tie Booker affair and, in his heavy Scottish accent, made a rousing case for the culture and language of "indigenous" people outside of London.
"A fine line can exist between elitism and racism," he said.
"On matters concerning language and culture, the distinction can sometimes cease to exist altogether."


Fighter Gives Up Title
PICHIT SITHBANGPRACHAN of Thailand has given up the International Boxing Federation flyweight championship rather than defend against the top-ranked JOSE LUIS ZEPEDA of the United States.
The move was announced yesterday by the I.B.F. president, ROBERT LEE, and took effect last Friday.
Sithbangprachan won a split decision over Zepeda on May 8 in Bangkok, Thailand.
He had been ordered to make a mandatory defense in a rematch by Dec. 4. (AP)


Suspicious Americans Want Review of Championships
The United States swimming federation has called for a review of the results from last summer's world swimming championships in Rome, where Chinese women won 12 of 16 gold medals.
Ray Essick, executive director of U.S.
Swimming, made the request yesterday after a report that a second Chinese champion has tested positive for a banned substance.
Essick is seeking the public disclosure of drug-testing histories for the Chinese swimmers.


Melkite Priest And One Other Guilty in Theft At Brink's Depot
A Melkite Catholic priest who has been hailed as a hero for his work with runaway teen-agers in the East Village in Manhattan was convicted today of conspiring to hide some of the $7.4 million stolen by masked gunmen from a Brink's armored-car depot here almost two years ago.
Another defendant was also convicted of conspiracy.
But prosecutors failed to make their cases against two other men, including a Brink's guard who they said took part in the robbery and was at the center of the conspiracy.
The jury in Federal District Court here acquitted him on all four charges he faced.


Lean on Serbia Now
The Bosnian city of Bihac is supposedly under U.N. and NATO protection, but by now it is probably too late to save it by military means.
Differing European and American agendas and a divided command structure requiring both NATO and U.N. approval ruled out a timely and effective use of air power, though even that might not have been sufficient to turn back the Serbian assault.
Fearing a divisive rift in NATO, the Clinton Administration has dropped its calls for more aggressive bombing, bowing once again to Europe's preference for letting the Serbs batter Bosnia into a negotiated settlement.
There is also talk of rewarding Serbian military gains by redrawing the proposed peace map in their favor.


Jets' Weaknesses Helped Marino Look Strong
It took a mediocre Jets team to blow a 24-6 third-quarter lead, even if the Dolphins have come back so often behind Dan Marino.
First, you keep your hands off Marino, allowing him time to work his magic.


Executive Changes
DEXTER CORP., Windsor Locks, Conn., named Kathleen Burdett, its vice president and controller, chief financial officer.
MANAGED HEALTH NETWORK INC., Los Angeles, a nationwide provider of managed behavioral health care and employee-assistance-program services, appointed Alethea Caldwell president and chief operating officer.


Strong Economic Signs Drive Bond Prices Down
Prices of Treasury securities were down across the board yesterday, as the bond market, having benefited from investors' shifting money out of stocks last week, reversed course.
Kevin McClintock, manager of fixed-income portfolios for Aeltus Investment Management Inc. in Hartford, cited reports of October home sales growth and strong Christmas sales as a troublesome twosome for bonds yesterday.


Automotive Industries
Class A shares of Automotive Industries Holdings hit a 52-week low of $16.25 yesterday, then closed at $16.50.
It was one of five auto parts suppliers whose shares were downgraded by an analyst.


Nepal to Have First Elected Communist Government in Asia
Efforts by the ruling Nepali Congress Party to block Nepal's Communists from coming to power collapsed today, clearing the way for the first democratically elected Communist government in Asia.
Officials at the royal palace in Katmandu said they expected the Communist leader, Man Mohan Adhikary, to make an early visit to King Birendra, possibly on Tuesday, to begin the process of forming a government.


Joanne Rathgeb Is Dead at 64; Was Crusader on Cancer Issues
Joanne Rathgeb, an actress, director and educator who fought for greater awareness and increased resources to fight breast cancer, died of the disease on Nov. 19 at her home in Essex Junction, Vt.
She was 64.
Her cancer was diagnosed nine years ago, but she continued an active life.
She retired last year as a professor of fine arts and drama at St.
Michael's College in Colchester after 30 years on the faculty.
She was the first woman to head the fine arts department there.


Painful Loss Can't Collapse Jets' Playoff Hopes
Give Pete Carroll this the morning after: He continues to discard those bad Jets memories, past and present.
That's why less than 24 hours after a devastating defeat to the Miami Dolphins, the Jets suddenly started thinking out loud today about the playoffs.


Ameritech Plans Charge Of $2.2 Billion
The Ameritech Corporation said today that it would take an after-tax charge of about $2.25 billion against its fourth-quarter earnings, in an acknowledgment that increasing competition is forcing it to replace aging equipment much faster than in the past.
The company said the one-time bookkeeping charge, totaling $4.08 a share, was a result of changing its accounting standards to those used by unregulated companies.


His Fondness for Guns Led Sniping Suspect to Trouble
Above all, the Suffolk County police said yesterday, Peter Sylvester did not want his mother to know about the long-barreled rifle.
Certainly not that he had hidden it in a ceiling she walked under whenever she went to the garage.
Long ago, the police said, she had told him never to bring guns into her ranch-style house in Nesconset, L.I.
Also on her forbidden list was a gun fancier's second love: glossy full-color magazines with shiny weapons spread out across page after page.


Time Warner May Revamp Entertainment Subsidiary
Time Warner Inc. is considering a reorganization involving its entertainment subsidiary, according to industry analysts.
One likely move, the analysts said, is shifting Warner Brothers and the HBO cable network out of the Time Warner Entertainment subsidiary and back under the umbrella of the parent company.
This would leave the entertainment subsidiary with just its cable systems and regional telephone operations.


One Sofa Yam's Guide To Football Announcers
Let's face an inescapable truth: hardly anybody watches games for the announcers.
Perhaps John Madden prevents tune-out during blowouts, but, really, Cowboys fans will watch their team play whether John Madden or Dave Madden -- Reuben Kinkaid of "The Partridge Family" -- is manning the Telestrator.
This sofa yam is the opposite of the regular fan.
I watch games I don't care about to keep tabs on announcers.
It can be tough duty.
Watch Gary Bender and Pat Haden on TNT?
Well, I've learned to do a solo Heimlich maneuver.

From a Sense of Snow to a Tussle With Time
BORDERLINERS  By Peter Hoeg  Translated by Barbara Haveland. 277 pages.
Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $22.
Like Peter Hoeg's last novel, the best-selling "Smilla's Sense of Snow," "Borderliners" is one of those books that functions on two levels.
"Smilla" was both a thriller and a philosophical meditation on the human condition; "Borderliners" is both a harrowing tale of an orphan's ordeals within the Danish child-care system and a philosophical meditation on the nature of time.


It's Time for Israel to Risk Peace With Syria
To the Editor:
In "A Peace Pact? Only if It's Genuine" (Op-Ed, Nov. 21), Benjamin Netanyahu paints a bleak picture of the prospect of a Golan-Heights-for-peace deal with Syria in order to scare the American public away from supporting a peace treaty between Israel and Syria.


Success Overnight, in a Sense: Vietnam's Artists Are in Vogue
During the Vietnam War, there was little paper and almost no canvas in North Vietnam, and so one of the fathers of modern Vietnamese painting, Bui Xuan Phai, was often forced to do his work on matchboxes and scraps of newsprint.
Mr.
Phai, who in his lifetime never earned more than the equivalent of a few hundred dollars from his art, had a graceful, fluid painting style that is still much imitated by Vietnamese artists, north and south.
He died in his beloved Hanoi in 1988.


A Cynical Argument Against Execution

COMPANY BRIEFS
ASHLAND COAL INC., Huntington, W. Va., which operates deep mines and surface mines that produce low-sulfur coal, said it was negotiating to acquire closely held Quaker Coal Co.'s Kentucky mining operations.
The terms were not disclosed.
BOEING CO., Seattle, said Braathens Safe, a privately held Norwegian airline, had ordered two Boeing 737-500 planes in a deal valued at about $62 million.


Big Babies
Q.
All my friends seem to be having very big babies.
Are more and more very large babies being born?
A.
It depends on how big you think a very big baby is and on who is counting, but at least in New York City, there has been an increase in the rate of large live births over the last four decades.


Mixing Dada, Cher, Middle America
Certain elements of David LaChapelle's shoot for Allure magazine last week were like almost every other fashion shoot organized in the 1990's: the photo assistant with a ponytail and sideburns, the model wearing stiletto heels two sizes too small, the fashion editor dressed for mourning and the crew ignoring the no smoking sign.
But put all those elements inside a gleaming silver conditioning chamber, used to test product durability at New York's Department of General Services Laboratory, and you have some indication of what is setting Mr.
LaChapelle apart in a field where familiarity -- familiar models, familiar sets, familiar fashion -- is breeding contempt.

U.S. Proposes Letting Banks Enter New Fields
In a step that could lead to big banks selling real estate, computer services or possibly even securities, Government regulators proposed rules today that would allow federally chartered banks to enter new lines of business.
The proposals represent the latest erosion of the Glass-Steagall Act, the landmark law that for 61 years has largely barred commercial banks from trading securities.
Enacted during the Great Depression in response to the stock market speculation that sank many banks in the early 1930's, the act was aimed at limiting banks to more conservative practices that at least in theory, would be less likely to produce large losses and threaten depositors' savings.

Bridge Gunman Is Called Angry but Sane
A psychologist testifying for the prosecution yesterday described Rashid Baz, who is on trial in the shooting of a group of Hasidic students on the Brooklyn Bridge in March, as a very angry man.
But he said he suffered from no mental condition that would absolve him of criminal responsibility for his actions.
The psychologist, Terrence Kaene, a professor at the Tufts University Medical School, was called to the stand in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to rebut testimony from two psychologists called last week by the defense, which is arguing that Mr.
Baz was insane during the few minutes that he opened fire on the van carrying 15 Hasidic students, killing one and wounding three.


James W. Cook, 90, Longtime Executive Of Phone Company
James Whitney Cook, who was with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and its subsidiaries for 40 years and was active in civic and business affairs in Illinois, died on Sunday at Naples Community Hospital in Naples, Fla.
He was 90, and lived in Naples and Osterville, Mass.
The cause of death was heart failure, his family said.

Ukraine Gets Reformer at the Helm
Andriy K. Denga, one of this bankrupt country's progressive farm managers, is doing just about everything he can to make money.
He has a contract with Italians to make smart leather attache cases.
A sewing shop is making inexpensive clothes for Germany.
Caged minks and foxes are being readied to have their fur made into hats.
People are very angry about the economy, "and a small spark can bring a blowup here," said Mr.
Denga, a onetime local Communist Party boss who wears a suit as he shows weekend visitors plows and cows.
"That's why we have to process agricultural material here rather than sell it at very low prices."


Campbell Soup Takes the Big Plunge Into Salsa
Mmm-mmm spicy!
The Campbell Soup Company, synonymous with the all-American kitchen for 125 years, said yesterday that it would join the nation's torrid salsa craze, acquiring Pace Foods Ltd. of San Antonio, the world's largest producer of Mexican sauces, for $1.115 billion.
Salsas, those spicy mixtures of jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, onion and garlic, have overtaken ketchup in retail dollar sales, thanks to their high markup, analysts said, though Americans still consume more pounds of ketchup.
Mexican sauce sales have grown at an annual rate of 13 percent since 1988 to $800 million in grocery store, club store and restaurant sales.
Thanks to their sharp taste and low fat count, the fast-growing Mexican sauces have been appearing on everything from pizzas to bagels.

Vicente Enrique y Tarancon, 87, Cardinal Pivotal to Spain, Dies
Vicente Cardinal Enrique y Tarancon, who played a leading role in the transition from dictatorship to democracy in Spain as Archbishop of Madrid and head of the Council of Bishops, died this morning in Casa de Salud, a hospital in Valencia.
He was 87.
He died of lung cancer, according to his doctor, Eduardo Benlloch.
His body will lie in state on Tuesday in San Isidro Church in Madrid, where he will be buried later as he requested.


An Indochinese Goat Is Imperiled by Its Year of Fame
As much as any animal can be, the sao la is publicity shy.
For thousands of years, small herds of these gentle, goat-like creatures munched their way through the mountainous grasslands of Indochina, drawing so little attention that the outside world had no hint of their existence.
But that all changed a year ago, when the sao la was suddenly thrust into the age of celebrity, pushed in front of the television cameras and celebrated on the pages of National Geographic and People Magazine -- overnight, a zoological superstar.


Redefining Diversity: Biologists Urge Look Beyond Rain Forests
BETWEEN the ever-lengthening menu of Rain Forest Crunch snack foods, the Rain Forest Action Network booths at rock concerts and street fairs, and the ubiquitous jungle-themed coffee mugs, T-shirts, place mats, tote bags, wall clocks, umbrellas and jewelry, the American public has been saturated with the message that tropical rain forests are among the greatest and most endangered of the world's natural wonders.
As the generic eco-lecture has it, tropical rain forests like the Amazon shelter enormous numbers of species, bristling with a variety of life forms so rich that science has barely begun to tally up the multitudes.
Tens of millions of species of plants, insects, fungi, amphibians, lizards, fish, snails and more remain to be discovered in the Edenic bosom of the tropical rain forests, and yet the forests are being turned into so much kindling and cow pasture before anybody has had a chance to know what is out there.


Battle of Fists And Figures
Vinny Pazienza, the International Boxing Council's super middleweight champion, was at Scores on East 60th Street yesterday for a news conference to promote his Jan. 14 rematch with Roberto Duran at the Atlantic City Convention Center.
Duran, stranded by the weather, didn't show up, but Barbara Anne Fenner did, along with several other dancers.
Their presence was appropriate, partly because Scores's owner, Michael Blutrich, is the fight's promoter, and partly because 100 Scores dancers will participate in a beauty contest as part of the pre-bout hoopla.


Vote in Norway Blocks Joining Europe's Union
Bucking a trend set by its Nordic neighbors, Norway early today became the only country to turn down membership in the expanding club of nations known as the European Union.
With almost 90 percent of the votes counted in a two-day nationwide referendum, the "no" votes were ahead of the "yes" votes by 52.8 percent to 47.2 percent.


PRESIDENT STAGES SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR TRADE ACCORD
President Clinton opened the White House this morning to a delegation of Republicans for the first time since Election Day to rally support for the global trade pact whose fate will be the first test of the bipartisanship on which he now must rely.
With the lame-duck Congress back in town to vote on the trade agreement, opponents of the accord were waging last-ditch efforts to block it, contending it could harm American workers and undermine United States sovereignty.
But they conceded that they lacked the votes in the House, which takes up the measure on Tuesday.
And Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, predicted that the measure would win a comfortable victory in the Senate as well when that body votes on Thursday.


Mellon Takes $130 Million Loss on Investments
In yet another example of how rising interest rates can devastate seemingly low-risk activities, the Mellon Bank Corporation said yesterday that it would take a $130 million after-tax loss to bail out customers of its securities lending division for investments gone awry.
A Mellon subsidiary, the Boston Company, had invested its clients' money in bonds that lost value as rates rose.
The bank declined to identify the investments, but people familiar with the bank's position said they included structured notes, securities with terms that can be custom-tailored for an investor.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; R. J. Reynolds Tobacco renews its hope that where there's low smoke, there's marketing fire.
FOR the last couple of days, advertising and marketing executives and Wall Street's tobacco industry analysts have sounded like astronomers: they just can't stop talking about that eclipse.
Their topic, to be precise, is Eclipse, the low-smoke cigarette that the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company is testing preliminarily in cities, including Atlanta, Buffalo and Chicago.
The $500 million question -- the cost to date for developing the brand -- is whether Reynolds can surmount the daunting problems it couldn't solve when Premier, its previous "smokeless" product, bombed by failing to satisfy smokers' needs for something that feels, smells and tastes like a cigarette.


S.E.C. Cites 2 Who Worked At Merrill Lynch on Trades
Two former executives of Merrill Lynch &amp; Company have been accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of various securities law violations arising from bond trades with a defunct Florida insurance company.
The bond trades between Merrill Lynch and the former Guarantee Security Life Insurance Company involved end-of-year transactions in the 1980's, in which the insurer would exchange junk bonds for Treasury securities, thereby creating a false image of financial strength.
The trades were arranged with the cooperation of Richard Allerton Jr., a Merrill Lynch corporate bond salesman, and Joseph G. Cote, formerly co-head of Merrill's junk bond department, according to the S.E.C.


For Freer Trade -- and Better Jobs
Senator Bob Dole, who once threatened to bury the global trade agreement signed by 124 nations, has now put America's interests first.
He has signed onto the accord after extracting innocent side agreements from the White House.
Mr.
Dole, whose threats were harshly criticized on this page, deserves full credit for rising above politics to rescue an agreement fashioned over seven years of tortured negotiations.
His leadership has made it likely, barring last-minute defections by Democrats, that the Senate will approve the agreement on Thursday after the House does so today.
Countries around the world will quickly follow suit.
Though Mr.
Dole's approval removed much of the drama, the importance of the votes should not be overlooked.
The trade accord will deliver a shot of economic adrenaline that few other government policies can match.
By some estimates, it will raise living standards in the U.S. by $1,000 or more per family.
Rejection of GATT would not only squander these gains, but would also prove diplomatically calamitous.


Study Finds Jurors Often Hear Evidence With Closed Minds
THERE is a joke among lawyers about the difference between jury trials in England and the United States: in England, the trial starts once the jury selection ends; in America, the trial is already over.
Now, as the weaknesses of the jury system are coming under increasing scrutiny, a new study shows that substantial numbers of jury members reach verdicts using faulty reasoning.


Bridge Team Still Dominant in Winning 4th Prestige Event
The team led by Nick Nickell of Raleigh, N.C., continued its dominance of major team championships by winning the Reisinger Board-a-Match Teams here Sunday night at the conclusion of the American Contract Bridge League's Fall Nationals.
His team, which included Richard Freeman of Atlanta, Jeff Meckstroth of Tampa, Fla., Eric Rodwell of Naperville, Ill., and Bob Hamman and Bob Wolff, both of Dallas, has won four of the last five prestige events: the Spingold Knockout Teams in 1993 and 1994, the 1993 Reisinger, and this one.
Its only miss was in the 1994 Vanderbilt Knockout Teams.


Tumult in Suffolk
Even in Suffolk County, L.I., which likes its politics tough and noisy, District Attorney James Catterson is a standout, aggressive in manner and harsh with opponents.
He says he makes enemies because he makes difficult decisions and does not suffer miscreants gladly.
Prominent officials accuse him of threatening to use grand juries against them unless they bow to his wishes.
Those are serious charges, amounting, if true, to abuse of office or misuse of the justice system.
They need investigating -- preferably by a special prosecutor or agency not based on Long Island.
Gov.
Mario Cuomo, whose office is considering a request by the county's executive and legislature for a special prosecutor, is in the best position to devise a proper inquiry before he leaves office.


Gym Rat Who Would Rebuild Pirates
Cozy feelings and warm memories filled George Blaney as he navigated his car through the streets of Jersey City.
With each block, the streets looked more and more familiar, and Blaney felt more and more at home.
Blaney was traveling the same route that he used as a teen-ager to get from the house on Bartholdi Avenue -- where his 86-year-old mother, Anne, still lives -- to St.
Peter's Prep High School on Grand Street.
The sights delighted him.
He was returning to a place he calls the Prep to be honored because he is the new basketball coach at Seton Hall University, but for a moment, he felt like a Prepster again.


Judge in a Bitter Clash With Simpson Lawyer
In a rare, verbally violent exchange in State Criminal Court in lower Manhattan yesterday, a judge did battle with a lawyer on the O.J.
Simpson defense team over the attorney's request to be excused from a case in New York.
The judge, Harold Rothwax, accused the lawyer of misstating facts.
The lawyer, Peter Neufeld, called the judge "shameful," whereupon the judge warned that he would put him in jail for contempt if he did not vacate the courtroom immediately.


U.S.-Russian Space Mission Stumbles, With Delivery Delays at Customs
The first major step in an effort to get beyond the cold war in space has stumbled as the delivery of gear for an American-Russian mission early next year has been delayed by, among other things, problems at Russian customs.
An American astronaut, Norman E. Thagard, is to fly into orbit atop a Russian rocket and work for three months in a Russian space station.
Dr.
Thagard, a physician, was to have performed biomedical experiments with American equipment while aboard the Russian space station, which is known as Mir.

The Talk of Hollywood; This Year, Oscar Bets Won't Be Sure Ones
Studio executives plotting their strategies for the Academy Awards have reached some unsettling conclusions.
The first is that once again there were surprisingly few powerful roles for actresses this year, despite the growing list of studio executives who are women and the often-stated proclamations of studio chiefs that they are card-carrying feminists.
Then there is the general paucity of creative and significant films of any kind, despite assurances from some executives that the industry is flourishing and movies are better than ever.


U.N. Reports Shortage Of Diphtheria Vaccine
As many as 40,000 children and adults will contract diphtheria in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union this year because of a shortage of vaccine there, United Nations health specialists said today.
The specialists, from the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, said the majority of cases were being reported from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.


Culture By Coercion
For a number of years, American culture has been asked to shoulder obligations once considered the responsibility of our politics, and this has radically altered the way we now regard the arts.
Staggering under large-scale deficits, our nonprofit cultural institutions are nevertheless being asked to validate themselves not through creative contributions but on the basis of community services.
As Alexis de Tocqueville once predicted: "Democratic nations will habitually prefer the useful to the beautiful, and they will require that the beautiful be useful."


Moderate Leftist Elected in Close Uruguayan Presidential Race
In what political analysts call Uruguay's closest election ever, former President Julio Sanguinetti of the opposition Colorado Party claimed victory today in a tight three-way race for the presidency.
He is expected to slow, but not abandon, the process of economic liberalization begun during five years of rule by the conservative National Party.
With 96 percent of the returns counted, the Interior Ministry said today that the centrist Colorado Party had received 32.2 percent of the vote, the National Party 31.1 percent and the leftist Broad Front 30.7 percent.


Chess
The last of the Intel Quick-Play Grand Prix tourneys was won by Gary Kasparov, the Professional Chess Association's world champion, when he defeated Predrag Nikolic of Croatia by 2-0 on Nov. 13 in Paris.
Kasparov not only received the $30,000 first prize for the final tournament but also shared the $100,000 prize for the best overall result with his Russian countryman Vladimir Kramnik.


CHRONICLE
Seems it takes more than a touch of pneumonia to keep DAN QUAYLE down.
The former Vice President went to the emergency room of the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis on Sunday and was told he had walking pneumonia, The Associated Press reported.
But there will be no lolling about in bed for him, said ANNE HATHAWAY, executive director for Issues '96, a political action committee headed by Mr.
Quayle.
He'll take medication, and he plans to keep his full travel schedule, she added.
Mr.
Quayle is considering a run for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996.


The Compuserve Edge: Delicate Data Balance
IN real estate, the saying goes, the three most important considerations are location, location and location.
In the unreal estate of cyberspace, the key considerations are content, content and content.
That is why more than two million people have taken up electronic residence in the Compuserve Information Service, the third stop on our tour of online information services.
Compuserve is the oldest of the Big Three information services (the others are Prodigy and America Online) and it has the richest reservoirs of business, professional and consumer information of any of the major consumer services.


Adrift, and Angry, On Bay Ridge Streets
Two brutal attacks in recent months have put a spotlight on hundreds of alienated teen-agers in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, whose isolation, anger and confusion have brought an edge of fear to one of New York's more stable neighborhoods.
The attacks, officials say, reflect an increase in violence in generally peaceful white enclaves of the city.

Mainly Pain At Airports In Spain
Airports across Spain were paralyzed today and more than 100,000 passengers stranded by a strike that Iberia workers staged to protest the state airline's plans to dismiss almost a quarter of its 24,000 employees and start selling off assets.
The strike grounded all Iberia flights, as unions and management tried to reach an agreement to save the airline, which is nearly bankrupt.


Britain and France Criticize U.S. on Bosnia Positions
The divisions between the United States and Western Europe over Bosnia erupted into unusually blunt public feuding today as leaders of Britain and France lashed out at American pressure to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims and step up air strikes on Bosnian Serb forces.
With frustration clearly mounting among NATO members after the assault by Bosnian Serbs on the Muslim enclave of Bihac, the British Defense Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, struck back at comments by Senator Bob Dole that implied that Britain was primarily responsible for a lack of a strong military response by NATO.


The History's Overlooked In This Historical Novel
STUART HALPINE, gray-haired and cardiganed, has become positively shocking, and he figures he knows why.

Jerry Rubin, 1960's Radical And Yippie Leader, Dies at 56
Jerry Rubin, the firebrand 1960's radical who used to preach distrust of "anyone over 30," died yesterday in Los Angeles.
He was 56 and lived in Los Angeles..
The cause was cardiac arrest, a hospital spokesman said.
Mr.
Rubin was struck by a car on Nov. 15 in Los Angeles.
Local authorities said he was hit while jaywalking.
He underwent surgery later that day, at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center and subsequently was listed in critical condition there.

Sylvia McNair's song recital at Alice Tully Hall on Sunday afternoon witnessed a fascinating competition between the singer's best friend and worst enemy, both being herself.
Ms.
McNair's mannerisms teeter constantly on the edge of overkill, yet the other elements of her music making are so intelligently devised, and ultimately so compelling, that one forgets and accepts, often happily.
What takes this young American lyric soprano beyond the ordinary is her determination to move the art of singing beyond the voice itself.
Sound becomes a conveyance.
In the four Purcell songs the destination was words, for Purcell the songwriter is Purcell the dramatist, with musical meter shaped to serve language.
From the exquisite "Music for a While" to "The Blessed Virgin's Expostulation," Ms.
McNair's diction and inflection owed as much to the theater as to the concert stage.


Montana Doubtful
JOE MONTANA's injured left foot was found yesterday to be sprained, and the Chiefs quarterback was pronounced questionable for Sunday's game against Denver.
His backup, Steve Bono, took all the snaps yesterday during a light workout.
Montana will be re-evaluated tomorrow. (AP)


Sugar Bowl Victory: Florida State
If high and close rankings count, the Sugar Bowl assured itself a premiere matchup yesterday when Florida State accepted an invitation to play the Southeastern Conference champion in the 61st Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on Jan. 2.
If television clout counts, the Fiesta Bowl guaranteed itself a high rating when it named Notre Dame as Colorado's opponent in Phoenix.

This Lady Loves 'Em And Leaves 'Em, Dead
Two contrasting works by Jerome Robbins, which the New York City Ballet presented on Sunday night at the New York State Theater, demonstrated this great American choreographer's ability to devise rewarding roles of many kinds.
The fact that in some forms of insect life, the females kill the males after mating would seem to be an unlikely subject for a ballet.
Yet this curious piece of scientific lore inspired Mr.
Robbins to create "The Cage," a dance-drama to Stravinsky in which a newborn insect matures into a killer.


It's Time for Israel to Risk Peace With Syria; P.L.O. Pact's Necessity
To the Editor:
The last time Benjamin Netanyahu wrote an Op-Ed article for your paper, I chastised his likening the Principles of the Israel-Palestine Liberation Organization accord signed last year at the White House to the Munich appeasement.
I also criticized his debating Israeli politics in The New York Times, an unwritten no-no in Likud party practice.

Madonna, Blond Ambition, Indeed
There are some biographies that cry out for the cheap slickness and superficiality that television movies insist on cultivating, and a prime specimen is available in tonight's "Madonna: Innocence Lost," formerly titled "Madonna: Unauthorized." Actually, a more Victorian subtitle, something like "Virtue Trampled," would be closer to the mark.
Sitting alone in her dressing room at Radio City Music Hall, the superstar Madonna (Terumi Matthews) looks into the mirror and says, "I didn't expect it to be this way." That's about as sympathetic as she gets in this tale of ambition driven by unceasing selfishness and ruthlessness.
Madonna Ciccone's early years in Detroit, where, she recalls, "I began my career in petulance and precociousness," are condensed to blurbs.
Mom dead of cancer, father (Dean Stockwell, of all people) always there for her, stepmother a problem.
High school: "When I lost my virginity, I considered it a career move."


G.O.P. Should Check Helms's Competence

Marino Says He Is Not Certain He Wants to Be Just a Senator
Still stunned by his ouster as majority leader of the State Senate, Ralph J. Marino said today that he had not decided whether he would remain in the body as simply the Senator from the Fifth District.
"It's been too soon for me, I think, to gather myself together and think about a direction I want to go in," Mr.
Marino said in a telephone interview from his office in Oyster Bay, L.I.
"I told my wife we ought to go to Montauk Point and talk about it, because I really don't know what the future holds.


Sports of The Times; Where McNair Fits Best
THE instinct is to go for the underdog, the one who comes out of nowhere and wins.
Now we have this greatly appealing young quarterback from this small school in Mississippi who grew up in impoverished surroundings in the Deep South.
He is blessed with an arm and head and mobility of a dream athlete and with the potential to enter the pro firmament with the likes of Unitas, or Montana, or, well, Starr.
In about 10 days Steve McNair of Alcorn State will or will not win the Heisman Trophy as the best, or at least most celebrated, college football player in the land.
The controversy, meanwhile, simmers.


Loophole at the Pier: A special report.; For Aliens, a Bahamas Cruise Is an Easy Way Into the U.S.
For illegal immigrants, getting into the United States can be as simple as climbing the gangplank of a cruise ship in the Bahamas and strolling off again in South Florida a few hours later -- without ever showing any proof of citizenship or exchanging even a word with an immigration service inspector.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service's own investigators found more than a year ago that foreign criminal gangs have used day cruises to the Bahamas as a virtual underground railroad for smuggling aliens and drugs into the United States.


U.S., IN SHIFT, GIVES UP ITS TALK OF TOUGH ACTION AGAINST SERBS
In a policy switch intended to close ranks with its Western European allies, the Clinton Administration has dropped talk of using air strikes and other forms of military pressure to stop Serbian attacks and compel the Serbs to agree to a peace settlement.
For months, the Administration has been trying to mobilize support for tough actions or threats of action against the Bosnian Serbs.
But facing a series of high-level meetings in Europe in early December, the Administration has begun issuing carefully coordinated statements about the futility of military action to end the fighting in the Balkans.

Stocks Higher in a Day of Seesaw Trading
The stock market, after an early morning surge and then fall, surprised traders yesterday by surging again, lifting prices for a second consecutive session.
But even with the gains, the market has recovered only a little more than a third of the ground it lost last week.
And many traders are skeptical about the stock market's continuing to rise, especially because several important economic reports, including third-quarter gross domestic product figures tomorrow and October new-home sales next Monday, could send the market tumbling.

Butch Beard had seen too much promise the past seven days for everything to revert back to his first week as the Nets' coach.

Fifteen minutes later, Beard's patience was rewarded.

Mystic Aquarium to Hire Leading Oceanographer
With aquariums around the country expanding to capitalize on growing public interest in the underwater world, Connecticut appears to have staged a major coup, recruiting Dr.
Robert D. Ballard, the current superstar of deep-sea exploration, to open an institute at its aquarium in Mystic.
Dr.
Ballard, best-known for leading expeditions that discovered the wrecks of the Titanic, the Bismarck and the Lusitania, plans to establish a center at the aquarium devoted to educating the public about the deep sea and to oversee the building of a submarine simulator that will allow the public to go on mock dives of 12,000 feet.
Visitors will witness real undersea expeditions and speak to the scientists conducting them through live video and telephone hookups in an auditorium.
They will also see more conventional exhibitions.

"Fun fur" used to be the name given to inexpensive pelts like rabbit and curly lamb, but now the real fun furs are fake furs made of synthetic fibers.

In the obviously fake category are Henri Bendel's versions of Mongolian lamb in colors like turquoise and cotton-candy pink.
There are vests at $128 and seven-eighths-length "chubbies" at $198.

THAT new CD-ROM drive is aching for disks to spin.
It came with an encyclopedia, a golf game and an electronic cookbook, all of which seemed like good ideas at the time.
But the computer is in the spare bedroom, not the kitchen; nobody in the house plays golf, and you do not look up things in an encyclopedia that often.

And while books are expensive too, at least you can sample them before whipping out a credit card.


Hospitals' New Creed: Less Is Best

After Setback, First Large AIDS Vaccine Trials Are Planned
IN a sharp turnaround driven by a desperate need to stop the AIDS epidemic, the World Health Organization is moving ahead with plans for the first large trials of the two most widely tested experimental AIDS vaccines.
The United States rejected plans for testing the vaccines in this country in June.
By a nearly unanimous decision last month, an advisory panel of experts gave the Geneva-based health organization a green light to design and carry out full-scale trials of the effectiveness of the two experimental vaccines against H.I.V., the AIDS virus.


How Tsunami Smashed Into a Sheltered Shore
GIANT sea waves generated by earthquakes can smash the shore with devastating force.
Sometimes these waves destroy not only coastal areas that directly face them, but also shore locations normally sheltered from the worst ravages of the sea.
Now researchers believe they have discovered how the giant waves, called tsunamis, cause damage in these areas.
Under certain conditions, they say, tsunamis striking ocean islands can divide, circle the land and converge on the other side as a secondary wave with enough force to demolish what should be a sheltered shore.


Serbs Close In on Bosnian Town; U.N. and NATO Unable to Act
Bosnian Serb forces pushed toward a complete encirclement of the Muslim enclave of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia today, demonstrating a military superiority that now seems likely to bring them political rewards.
With all international deterrents to the Serbs crumbling amid recrimination and disarray, they shelled the town center of Bihac and threatened any flights into airport in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, 140 miles to the southeast, by moving a surface-to-air missle system within range of it, Western officials said.


Giants Still Talk About Flagging Playoff Train
So you laugh upon hearing the words "Giants" and "playoffs" in the same sentence.
A chuckle accompanies the thought that a team that lost seven games in a row will somehow make it to the post-season.
There are 10 million reasons why the Giants shouldn't get in, and one of them is that any team losing to the Los Angeles Rams should automatically have the playoff door slammed in its face.
The Jets provide enough amusement, you say, so halt all this playoff nonsense.

On Top of the Poll: UMass's Minutemen
Massachusetts, which shocked college basketball by trouncing Arkansas in its season opener, took over the No. 1 ranking for the first time yesterday.
The Minutemen, who beat the top-ranked defending national champions, 104-80, in the Tip-Off Classic at Springfield, Mass., on Friday night, received all but 7 of the 65 first-place votes cast by the national news media panel.
The Minutemen moved up two spots in the poll, leapfrogging North Carolina, which received six first-place votes after beating Texas in its season opener.
Kentucky, which had the other first-place vote, moved up one spot to third and Arkansas, which bounced back with a victory over Georgetown, dropped to fourth.

Ewing's Sore Right Knee Has Knicks Hobbling
The Knicks hold themselves to higher standards than most teams.

For those reasons, both the Knicks and Ewing will be searching for more consistency heading into Tuesday night's road game against the Washington Bullets.
Not only have the Knicks (6-4) lost four of their last seven games, but Ewing hasn't performed to his normal level of excellence while still recovering from arthroscopic right knee surgery in July.

A Limit on Vendor Permits Is Proposed by the Mayor
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday proposed restricting food vendors on the city's streets by limiting to two the number of permits any one person can own.
The proposal, part of a long-awaited plan on food carts, comes months after Mr.
Giuliani sharply limited where the vendors could operate in midtown.
Although administration officials said the proposal is intended to put more permits in the hands of individuals, it could also reduce the number of vendors.

And while the ruminations ranged widely on the implications for other Hollywood creative types, many agreed that the impact would fall most directly on the big movie studios -- like Warner Brothers,, Paramount, Universal, Columbia and Disney -- that depend heavily on television production for profits.

"So we are now working for the earliest possible date."


The Los Angeles Under the Salonen Spell
The music world was aghast in the late 1980's when Ernest Fleischmann, the managing director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, proclaimed the death of the symphony orchestra.
But perhaps his doomsaying had a local intent: to strike terror into the hearts of the musicians whose careers he controlled in order to get them to play as if their lives depended it.
It's just a theory.
Another is that the vibrancy the orchestra showed in its concerts at Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday afternoon and Monday evening should be ascribed to Esa-Pekka Salonen, the 36-year-old Finnish conductor who is in his third season as music director.
Actually, the orchestra was in fine shape when Mr.
Salonen took it over.
On its last visit to New York, in 1990, it produced a beautifully blended sound for Andre Previn.
For that matter, the orchestra played gorgeously for Carlo Maria Giulini 15 years ago.


Empire Blue Cross Will Restrict Coverage for Some Applicants
Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield announced plans yesterday to stop offering a special type of comprehensive health care coverage to new applicants because the policy, used mostly by those with cancer and AIDS, has cost the troubled company millions of dollars in the past five years.
The move was immediately criticized by advocates for the seriously ill patients who seek the coverage, who contended that the move would leave thousands of people with inadequate health care.

Always on the Verge Of Dramatic Adventure
At one point, the plays in repertory at the august Norwegian National Theater in Oslo were "Rosmers holm" and "Jomfrutur." The first is, of course, an Ibsen classic.
The second sounds like something one might have on toast for breakfast.
Translated into English, the title would be "Virgins on a Tour," or, less literally, "Maiden Voyage."
When it is revealed that the leading characters are three Victorian ladies on a whirlwind jaunt to Terra Incognita, theatergoers might recognize "On the Verge," Eric Overmyer's most produced play.
In this and other works, nothing is cognita about Mr.
Overmyer's terra as he zigzags with the Zeitgeist, spoofing consumerism and extremism in all its extremities.

Would a Penalty Box Save the Quarterbacks?
John McVay, the San Francisco 49ers' vice president for football administration, said he has seen more blindside hits on quarterbacks this season than he can ever recall.
That's why he is proposing that the National Football League competition committee study the use of a penalty box, similar to the one used in the National Hockey League, for defensive players who deliver dangerous blows to quarterbacks.
"These same defensive players who avoid punters, holders and kickers are good enough athletes to avoid hitting the quarterback after he's released the ball," McVay said.
"So many people are putting hits on quarterbacks this year that someone needs to come up with something innovative to try to stop it.

LIKE a high, hard heater from a rested Roger Clemens, the flash point of reckoning appears to be closing in on major league baseball players.
Unless they acquiesce sometime this week, accept a deal that impairs their most sacred ideal, they are going to enter uncharted waters that could be over their heads.
It doesn't mean they will collectively drown, in this sports labor war.
They will just find themselves for the first time with the kind of choice that can rattle the soul, and unhinge the heart.
The direct choice between sacrifice and salary, patronage and profit.

Arthur Moore retired last spring after 20 years in the Army, he decided to stop complaining about public schools and do something about them: He applied for a job as a fifth-grade teacher at Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Elementary School here.
City school officials quickly hired him.
"Male teachers are a premium in any public school, but especially at the elementary level," said Emma J. Hamlin, the principal at Coleridge-Taylor, where 7 of the 27 teachers are men.
"We're fortunate to have someone with his background."


Intermarriage Challenges Many, Not Few
To the Editor:
Jane E. Brody (Personal Health column, Nov. 23) repeats from the findings of the survey of sexuality by Chicago-based social scientists that the "melting-pot mix of ethnic, religious and racial heritages is relatively rare." This misrepresents the extent of the phenomenon and thereby understates the challenges that confront people who marry those of other cultures.


Abused Women Won't Have to Wait for Justice
To the Editor:
The phone rings, jolting me from a sound sleep.
I'm hardly awake, yet the adrenaline rush makes my heart race.
I'm sure there's been an accident -- or worse.
My hand darts out from under the blankets and gropes in the dark for the receiver.
The clock on the dresser reads 2:15 A.M.
"Good morning, judge. Did I wake you?" It's the duty sergeant at police headquarters in the quiet village of Scarsdale, New York, where I have served as judge for the last seven years.
In that time there have been many middle-of-the-night calls.
Criminal activity does not keep regular hours, and mine is a 24-hour-a-day job.


Ex-Members Compare Campus Ministry to a Cult
When the fog lifted from her mind, Sarah Lieu found herself scrounging pats of butter at the Au Bon Pain restaurant near the student center on the Rutgers University campus.
She was penniless and hadn't eaten for days, she recalled six months after the incident.
Only the gnawing hunger, she said, was able to break a spell that gripped her toward the end of her freshman year.


Whose Money Is It, Anyway?
After a year of nervous wavering in the face of Congressional opposition, the Federal Election Commission is scheduled to vote tomorrow on new rules to restrict one of Congress's most cherished -- and most offensive -- perks: House and Senate members' ability to dip into their campaign treasuries to pay personal expenses.
Action by the highly partisan six-member commission, while no cure-all, would be a big step forward.
A 1979 law bars candidates from converting their campaign funds "to any personal use." But in the absence of F.E.C. rules defining what that means, spending on items like restaurant meals, sports tickets, cars, clothes, travel and club dues has become widespread.
Many members resent the very idea that the F.E.C. would try to impose restrictions.
But the freedom to convert campaign money for personal use allows special interests to stuff money directly into lawmakers' pockets.


In Term Limits Debate, Justices Take Up a 'Very Hard' Case
An intense and sometimes confusing Supreme Court argument today on the validity of state-imposed term limits for members of Congress left one thing clear: no precise legal precedent and no undisputed historical evidence exists to guide the Justices' decisions in the most important case on the structure of the national Government to reach the Court in years.
Prodded by the Justices' questions, the four lawyers who presented the 90-minute argument disputed nearly every proposition, and even ostensible allies could not always agree along the way.


Uniao dos Palmares Journal; From Brazil's Misty Past, a Black Hero Emerges
High on a hill, in the cool shade of a breadfruit tree, candles flickered among earthenware pots containing offerings for the long-ago dead -- honey, corncakes, rice, beans and white flowers.
"The offerings are in honor of Zumbi, and in honor of all the warriors who died here," said Pedro Jose dos Santos, who was dressed head-to-toe in white as prescribed by Umbanda, one of Brazil's largest African-based religions.


Corrections
An article on Tuesday about the Government's decision to drop its effort to bar a homosexual from serving in the Navy misstated a Federal appeals court's rationale in the case.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, found that under the old military policy restricting homosexuals, the Navy officer, Keith Meinhold, could not be discharged for merely saying he is homosexual.
But the ruling did not say the policy violated equal protection guarantees of the Constitution.


Coat Call
Move over, Santa.
New Yorkers are about to get another big, red symbol of holiday generosity: a 40-foot-high red wool coat.
The coat will be installed in Grand Central Terminal on a specially built wooden frame to remind New Yorkers to clean out their closets for the annual "New York Cares" coat drive for the needy.
The drive begins tomorrow.
This worthwhile recycling effort -- now in its sixth year -- collected 65,000 used but wearable overcoats, jackets and parkas in 1993, helping to make a harsh winter that much warmer for the homeless, new immigrants and impoverished seniors and children.
The goal this year is to collect 75,000 adult and kid-size coats before the drive ends on Dec. 31; the giant red coat, contributed by the Searle clothing stores, will itself be cut up to add 100 smaller coats to the collection.


Accounts
Black &amp; Decker Power Tools Group, Towson, Md., and Black &amp; Decker Household Products Group, Shelton, Conn., to McCann-Erickson New York to handle the consolidated media portion of their North American account, with billings estimated at $30 million to $35 million.
The media duties were previously divided among McCann New York; BBDO Canada, Toronto, and the Leo Burnett Co., Chicago.
Fallon McElligott, Minneapolis, continues to handle the print media portion for power tools in the United States. *
Calyx &amp; Corolla, San Francisco, to Goldberg Moser O'Neill, San Francisco, as the first agency to handle advertising for the company, which sells fresh flowers by mail order.
Billings were estimated at $5 million.

Eating Well; Easy Ways To Have Healthier Holidays
VERY few people swear allegiance to a fat-free diet during the holidays or choose this time to straighten up their eating habits.
In a survey of 771 adults conducted earlier this month by Prevention Magazine and CNN, more than two-thirds said they planned to eat whatever they wanted for Thanksgiving, Christmas and Hanukkah.
Forty percent thought they would gain weight -- an average of about four and a half pounds -- as a result.
Most men thought they would later shed those pounds; the women were less sure.


Toy Theft in the Bronx: 'Like Stealing Christmas'
Standing in the gray light before dawn, Robert Santos wondered if Santa Claus had come early: the security gate installed to protect his Salvation Army building in the South Bronx had been rolled up during the night, and someone had been inside.
A red-suited long-distance delivery specialist?
But Mr.
Santos, a commanding officer of the Salvation Army's social services department in the South Bronx, soon realized that whoever had broken in had stolen the toys, not dropped them off.


Glenn Is Putting Bad Game Behind Him
Aaron Glenn has been trying to take his first bad game as a professional in stride.
"I don't worry about it," Glenn, the Jets' rookie cornerback, said today as he was leaving the team's practice facilities on the Hofstra University campus.
"Everyone is going to get beat. Even Deion Sanders got beat a week ago. It's just something that happens to the corners."


U.S. Policy Shift on Bosnia Creates a Muddle With Allies
The Clinton Administration's latest shift in policy on Bosnia put senior officials on the defensive today and left them struggling to explain how their new strategy would end the war.
The state of confusion within the Administration and between Washington and its allies has also overshadowed the Administration's plan to press for an expansion of NATO and a new security organization for Europe in meetings with the allies this week and next.


Signs To a Global Village In Progress
The 22d Sao Paulo Bienal is a megashow that needs to make up its mind.
Does this hodgepodge of weak art and mixed messages want to be, like its European counterparts, a survey of the artistic mainstream, accessorized with an amorphous, loosely applied theme?
Does it want to redefine the megashow concept into something more egalitarian and genuinely international?
Or does it want to remain the amateurish exercise in nationalism and regionalism that it has tended to be in recent years?
To varying degrees, the answer to all of the above is: yes.


AT WORK WITH: Beverly Harvard; Atlanta's Police Chief Won More Than a Bet
They say that a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing.
In the case of Beverly Harvard, it proved to be a fortuitous thing as well.
Chief Harvard, the new head of the Atlanta Police Department, said that had she known 21 years ago that the tests she would have to take to become a police officer would be arduous, grueling and take two months, she probably would not have attempted them.
She took them in response to a challenge -- a $100 bet that she would fail -- from her husband and a family friend who was skeptical about a woman's capacity to do the job.


Rap Artist Tupac Shakur Shot in Robbery
Tupac Shakur, a rap performer who is standing trial on charges of sexual abuse in Manhattan, was shot five times early today as he and two companions walked into a recording studio in midtown, police said.
Mr.
Shakur, 23, and the other men, who were not identified, were walking through the lobby of Quad Recording Studios at 723 Seventh Avenue, near 48th Street, about 12:25 A.M. when three men approached and demanded money, said Sgt.
James Coleman, a Police Department spokesman.
It was not clear why the men then shot Mr.
Shakur and one of his companions, the police said.
Mr.
Shakur, who was struck twice in the head, twice in the groin and once in one hand, was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center where he was listed in guarded condition, said Wes Anglin, a hospital spokesman.
"He is alert," Mr.
Anglin said, and his wounds were not believed to be life-threatening.
The second man was shot twice in the abdomen and was taken to St.
Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center.
His condition was not available early this morning.
The third man with Mr.
Shakur was not injured.
The three robbers fled after taking money or property from the three men, Sergeant Coleman said.
Mr.
Shakur, who starred last year with Janet Jackson in the movie "Poetic Justice," has been standing trial with his road manager, Charles Fuller, on charges of sodomizing and sexually abusing a woman in the Parker Meridien Hotel last November.


FINANCE BRIEFS
Debt  *
Federal Home Loan Bank is selling $50 million of notes due in 1999 through First Tennessee Bank.
The notes, which are callable in two years, carry an interest rate of 8.28 percent and are priced at par.


Suspect in Dahmer Killing Said, 'I'm the Chosen One'
The suspect in the beating death of Jeffrey L. Dahmer is a 25-year-old convicted murderer who went to prison two years ago proclaiming that he was the son of God and that a family of voices told him "who I could trust and who was my enemy."
The suspect, Christopher J. Scarver, killed a man in a robbery in 1990, the year before Mr.
Dahmer was arrested on charges that led to 15 consecutive life terms, a sentence that ended Monday in a pool of blood, next to a toilet.


Cordially if Not Enthusiastically, Mayor and Governor-Elect Meet
After all the bitterness and political comedy of manners, George E. Pataki and Rudolph W. Giuliani met for the first time yesterday as governor-elect and mayor, offering a display of cordiality, if not a heartfelt pledge to make up and be friends.
Exactly three weeks after Election Day, the Mayor and the Governor-elect, both Republicans but otherwise at odds since Mr.
Giuliani crossed party lines to endorse Mario M. Cuomo, emerged from their meeting promising to put campaign nastiness behind them and work together for New York City and State.


Footwear Accounts For Two Agencies
Two agencies have been awarded footwear accounts.
The Nine West Group in Stamford, Conn., has named Toth Design and Advertising in Concord, Mass., to handle its Spa line of shoes, which was previously handled in-house and by various agencies on a project basis.
Billings have not been determined.
Toth was awarded the account after a two-month review that also included two New York agencies, Balet &amp; Albert and Ziccardi &amp; Partners.


A Club of Rich Nations Looks Beyond Europe
A prolonged diplomatic battle over who should head the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ended today much as it began earlier this year -- with Jean-Claude Paye of France still in the post of Secretary General and many governments eager to see him replaced.
But after weeks of late-night meetings, the 25-nation economic research group for the world's wealthier nations, did at least agree today on a future settlement of the dispute: Mr.
Paye will be reappointed for only 18 months, and in June 1996 will be succeeded by Donald Johnston, a former Canadian Minister of Economic Development.


Abused Women Won't Have to Wait for Justice; Beating in a Courthouse
To the Editor:
In September of this year one of my clients, the wife of a Rikers Island inmate, was severely beaten by her husband while he was awaiting his hearing in a Brooklyn courthouse.
He had been brought from Rikers and left with her, unguarded and unrestrained, in a waiting room.
She had had him arrested for an assault on her in June.
This second beating occurred before Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's announcement of Corrections Department budget cuts.
What will happen to battered women after these cuts are made?


Government Securities' Prices Fall
The government securities market was clearly settled in a bearish pattern yesterday, as prices fell after a report showed that consumer confidence had surged to a four-year high.
But the decline was tempered by a move by the Federal Reserve to inject money into the banking system.
As part of its regular operations, the Fed buys various notes and bonds, usually about $3 billion to $5 billion worth, for the purpose of tempering interest rates, particularly during the holiday season when money may be in tight supply.


Olympics Are Opened to Serbian Players
Basketball's world governing body has opened the door for Serbian players to participate in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
At a meeting last Saturday in Munich, Germany, FIBA's European Commission voted to allow the rump state of Yugoslavia, now composed of Serbia and Montenegro, to compete in qualifying for the men's and women's European championships to be held in the summer of 1995.


Rescuer of Youths Proves Justice Isn't Always Blind
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ was intervening.
As director of the Andrew Glover Youth Program on the Lower East Side, Mr.
Rodriguez does that.
He stands up for young people in trouble with the law, stands up before judges, prosecutors, parole officers, drug dealers, gang leaders and relatives.
Sometimes, when it's in the best interest of the community, he stands up to the troubled young.
"You have to weigh various interests," said Mr.
Rodriguez, who has just won an award of $25,000 for his organization as a hero of the Robin Hood Foundation.
"You want to provide alternatives to incarceration, but you also want to do what's in the best interest of the community, and you want to uphold the credibility of the justice system. That may require putting some fear into a kid, maybe letting him do city time so he never wants to do state time."


How Nativism Infects California Proposition
To the Editor:
William Safire should have titled his Nov. 21 column not "Self-Deportation?" but instead "Self-Deception."
Mr.
Safire withdrew his charge that California's Proposition 187 is driven primarily by nativism after considering two counterarguments offered by Gov.
Pete Wilson: that the proposition is anti-illegal-immigrant rather than anti-immigrant, and that most legal immigrants support it.


Cobb's Ghostwrite Sharpens His Pencils
In 1961, Al Stump ghostwrote Ty Cobb's autobiography, "My Life in Baseball," a sanitized account of baseball's greatest hitter and meanest character: a spike-sharpening, bigoted, misogynistic, gun-toting, suspicious hellion despised as much for his vicious personality as he was applauded for his revolutionary aggressiveness on the ball field.
Disputes over how to portray controversies in Cobb's turbulent 74-year life were settled by Doubleday, the publisher, in favor of the man voted first into baseball's Hall of Fame.


Applied Extrusion Technologies Inc. reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30


Home Entertaining; Tips From a Perennial Guest
THE fashion designer Jon Haggins is an A-list kind of guy, a self-described perennial guest.
"I've done five parties in a night and made it home by 9," Mr.
Haggins said, adding that he sometimes goes to as many as 12 in a single week.
Mr.
Haggins, who also produces fashion shows, organizes group trips to Africa and is at work on an autobiography, has been invited to so many parties in Connecticut that one host suggested he move there.
And when he's not attending a party, he's more often than not throwing one.
With such an active social life, he knows what makes a party tick and has definite thoughts about entertaining his own guests.
For him, setting the right mood is as important as the food and drinks he serves.


Talks Held On American Brands Unit
Continuing its quest for acquisitions to help overcome stagnant sales in its life insurance business, the American General Corporation said yesterday that it was talking with American Brands Inc. about acquiring that company's life insurance subsidiary.
The American Brands subsidiary, the Franklin Life Insurance Company of Springfield, Ill., is a profitable, well-capitalized company that specializes in sales to middle-income families through a network of about 3,000 agents.
With $6.2 billion of assets, Franklin is about a sixth the size of American General's insurance subsidiaries, which focus on middle- and lower-income customers.


Toehold for Islam -- A special report; Muslim Party Threatens Turks' Secular Heritage
Esref Cosan is a new arrival in this mud-and-concrete satellite of Istanbul, a man of the countryside more used to tending his beehives than hustling for work on construction sites that have no jobs to offer.
In many ways, though, his uprooting from village to city is the story of modern Turkey.
When he and his family arrived here the other day, fleeing the civil war against Kurdish guerrillas in the southeast, they became part of a wave of migration to the cities that has shifted the nation's center of gravity from village to metropolis.
And, propelled from Anatolia's far reaches by poverty and war, needs and dreams, this great column has come to represent another phenomenon, far more troubling to Turkey's authorities and their Western allies -- the grist of an Islamic movement that would challenge the secular core and Western leanings of the 71-year-old republic.


Political Turnabout as Fair Play, Circa 2014
It is hard to figure out what Ishmael Reed is up to in his new play, "The Preacher and the Rapper." But it is not at all hard to see what the director, Rome Neal, and an exuberant cast want the production at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe to be: semiriotous fun.
The lines are often terrific, and one leaves the theater laughing, not at all worried that plot and story were, at best, confused.
The play begins now, in 1994, with stars of religion, politics and the media all pursuing the evil of the day, a rap artist.
But it soon jumps 20 years ahead, when a woman is President; the nation's religion is the witches' cult Wiccan; the rapper is Attorney General, and the Preacher of the title and the Pope are in prison, joined by at least some of the press.
Does that make things right?
Not at all.
Everyone gets punctured, gleefully.


'Amahl' to Be Presented
The Little Orchestra Society is to present its annual performances of Menotti's holiday opera "Amahl and the Night Visitors," at 11 A.M. and 1 and 3 P.M. on Saturday at Avery Fisher Hall.
Amahl is to be sung by Matthew Butler, his mother by Susan Shafer and the Three Kings by Blaine Hendsbee, Gary Simpson and Brian Matthews.
Dino Anagnost is to conduct this production, the composer's own, created for the Little Orchestra Society.
Tickets are $15 to $32.
Information: (212) 721-6500.


Yeltsin Threatens Action on Warring Secessionist Area
The civil war in a breakaway region of Russia threatened to enter a dangerous new phase today when President Boris N. Yeltsin declared that he would impose a state of emergency there if fighting did not stop by Thursday.
"Chechnya is a republic within the Russian Federation," he said this morning at a meeting of his National Security Council, which met through much of the day.
"We have no moral right to stand aside and watch this bloodshed. The situation poses an extreme danger to stability and peace in our society."


Croat Warns Of Wider War If Bihac Falls
The Croatian Defense Minister warned the Clinton Administration today that Croatia would enter the war against the Serbs if Bihac fell into Serbian hands.
Defense Minister Gojko Susak said he thought the Bosnian Serbs and Croatian Serbs would probably be satisfied with surrounding Bihac and turning it into a powerless Muslim enclave.
Taking the entire town, he added, would require the Serbs to engage in costly house-to-house fighting.


Replacement Players May Play Ball Next Year
Barring a 180-degree change in baseball's labor negotiations, the owners not only are headed for implementation of their salary-cap proposal next Monday, but they are also hurtling toward the use of replacement players next summer, their chief labor spokesman said tonight in his clearest comments on the controversial weapon in the clubs' bargaining briefcase.
The remarks by John Harrington came -- almost as an afterthought -- at the end of a long, unproductive day in talks between negotiators for the owners and the striking players at the Lansdowne Conference Resort 15 minutes from Dulles International Airport.


Disputing 4 Studies, New Research Supports Chest X-Rays as Cancer Screen
After re-analyzing the data from four major studies, a specialist in cancer treatment yesterday challenged their conclusion that annual chest X-rays are of no benefit to smokers and former smokers.
The studies had found no difference in death rates between the participants who were screened and those who were not.
But the specialist, Dr.
Gary Strauss, a medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, reported that he found a benefit when he looked at the data in a different way.


THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; A dispute over radio spots focuses an unlikely spotlight on a rift among conservatives on GATT.
A SPAT over GATT is causing a rift on the right.
Disagreements among some of the nation's most widely known conservatives about the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is facing a crucial Senate vote tomorrow, are manifesting themselves in an advertising dispute.


CHRONICLE
When word came that Jerry Rubin, a symbol of radical protest in the 1960's, had died in Los Angeles on Monday night two weeks after having been struck by a car, there was no thought among his old friends of postponing a party planned for tonight.
As they have every year since 1990, the year after Abbie Hoffman died, friends and admirers of Mr.
Hoffman, who was Mr.
Rubin's colleague on the barricades, will gather for his birthday at the Wetlands, a downtown music club.
They will also be celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Chicago Seven conspiracy trial, in which Mr.
Hoffman and Mr.
Rubin were defendants.


Executive Changes
LEVER BROTHERS CO., New York, named Melinda Sweet senior vice president and general counsel.
NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE CO., New York, promoted Michael L. Callahan, vice president in charge of the corporate compliance department, and Thomas J. Warga, vice president and general auditor, to senior vice presidents.
It also named Lee Lapioli senior vice president and chief information officer.


Congress's Lame Ducks Sing Their Swan Songs
The end of an era in Congress collided today with the dawn of a new one as departing Democrats sang their swan songs and incoming Republicans tried not to gloat.
Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican and soon-to-be chairman of the Judiciary Committee, carried around a bumper sticker that said it all: "Speaker Gingrich. Deal With It."


Diana
The New York Times Shares of the Diana Corporation, a food wholesaler based in Milwaukee, dropped sharply yesterday after the company reported that earnings in the second quarter fell more than 50 percent.
The company cited falling profits in its meat business and losses on bonds.


School District Is a Candidate For Takeover
While other school districts in New York City have had their share of trouble, the litany of mismanagement and outright corruption in District 17 in Central Brooklyn stands out as a study of the worst problems of decentralization.
Thousands of dollars' worth of books, computers and furniture were taken from a school; officials suspect they were sold to a private school.
At another school, a teacher's aide who had been accused of molesting four girls in an auditorium was elected P.T.A. president, a position he held for months afterward, until he was arrested on charges of molesting another girl at his home.
Administrators of a third school are battling with parents over whose students should occupy a new building.


Traders Seek Direction As Stocks Close Mixed
The stock market, after rising for two days, closed mixed but essentially unchanged yesterday, as long-bond yields again climbed past 8 percent.
The real test for equities will likely come today with the release of third-quarter gross domestic product figures that may confirm or dispel traders' fears of an overheating economy.
As in Monday's trading, the number of advancing stocks -- 1,155 -- almost equaled the number of decliners -- 1,075.
The narrow division underscores traders' indecision about the direction of the market.
But 107 stocks established new lows and only 11 set new highs.


Coleman Blisters Nets After Another Fade
The first morsel of distressing news for the Nets occurred in the second quarter when it was learned that the starting shooting guard Kevin Edwards would miss at least three weeks with a partially torn left Achilles' tendon.
The next morsels of distressing news occurred over and over again in the fourth quarter, when the Nets revealed a fatal flaw in failing to protect a 16-point lead at home against the Los Angeles Lakers.


Ritualizing Grief, Love and Politics; AIDS Memorial Services Evolve Into a Distinctive Gay Rite
The stage was dark at the Astor Place Theater in the East Village, except for a screen flashing slides of a glittery disco scene from the early 1980's.
A black-and-white poster, made from a photograph, of a smiling man raising a glass hung from wires, looking suspended in air.
The images transported the audience to a time in the life of New York City's gay populace that one mourner described as "filled with magic," a time when the man in the picture, Bruce Mailman, was still strong and healthy, before AIDS began stealing lives away by the thousands.


U.N. TO WITHDRAW UNLESS THE FIRING IN BOSNIA CEASES
Humiliated and harassed by Bosnian Serb forces, the United Nations has decided to inform the warring parties in Bosnia officially that it will end its peacekeeping mission unless a countrywide cease-fire is reached quickly.
Senior Western officials said today that the planned visit to Sarajevo on Wednesday by the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was conceived to put the maximum political weight behind a warning that fighting must stop now or United Nations forces will leave.


Food Notes
For Starters
Many people who entertain at this time of year do most of the cooking themselves but still rely on some outside sources.
Items that are time-consuming to make, like hors d'oeuvre tidbits and desserts, can easily be purchased.
With that in mind, here are some suggestions.
It is best to order at least two days in advance and confirm pick-up or delivery arrangements.
Sumptuous gougeres, the French savories made of cream-puff pastry and cheese, perfect to pass at a party or to cut into wedges for a cocktail buffet, are from FLAVORS , 8 West 18th Street.
A large gougere is $16; the minis, $6 a dozen.
Warm them before serving.

"We have no moral right to stand aside and watch this bloodshed. The situation poses an extreme danger to stability and peace in our society."


Supreme Court Upholds Government's Ambiguously Written Child Pornography Law
The Supreme Court salvaged the Federal law against child pornography today by editing it to make clear that the Government must prove that a defendant knew that the performers in sexually explicit photographs or films were under the age of 18.
Congress almost certainly intended to include a knowledge requirement even though "the most natural grammatical reading" of the densely written law does not find one, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said in a 7-to-2 decision.


PGA Ready to Play Hardball
The PGA Tour today issued a formal response to the World Golf Tour, and it can be summed up in two words: no compromise.
After a two-day meeting of its Tournament Policy Board in Tampa, the PGA Tour decided to hold a hard line in all dealings with the World Tour, which two weeks ago announced its intention to stage eight worldwide events in 1995 worth $25 million, televised by the Fox Television Network and featuring the top 30 players on the Sony World Rankings and 10 selected other players.


Lois/USA Chosen By Press Group
The American Business Press, which represents about 660 trade and business publications, said yesterday that it had selected Lois/USA in New York to handle its account, previously handled in-house.
Billings are estimated at $2 million in the next two years.
Gordon T. Hughes 2d, president of the association in New York, said Lois/USA was awarded the account after a three-month review that was narrowed to that agency and three other New York-based finalists: the Gotham Group, Lotas Minard Patton McIver and Mad Dogs and Englishmen.

Lobbying in the Video Age


Corrections
A chart in Business Day on Thursday about a problem with the Intel Corporation's Pentium computer chips omitted a decimal point in an example of the type of arithmetic mistake that sometimes occurs when the chips are used to perform division.
In the example, the mathematical significance of the error in the calculation by the Pentium, compared with the original data, was 6.1/100,000 , not 61/100,000 .


The City Council's Soft Numbers
The budget standoff between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the New York City Council is about power.
The Council is trying to regain clout it lost when the Mayor pushed his original budget through without much opposition.
In fairness to the Council, the struggle is also about the concerns of Council members for their constituents, especially the poor who depend on city services.
In dollar terms, the two sides are not far apart.
At issue is roughly $100 million of cuts in the city's $31.6 billion budget.
The budget was supposedly balanced at the time it was adopted in June, but lagging tax collections and rising expenses have opened up a new gap that must be closed.
Last month the Mayor presented a package of $800 million in spending cuts to help close it.
The Council agreed with $700 million of his cuts, but last week adopted its own plan for the other $100 million.


Public &amp; Private; 17 Going On 18
Dear Golden Girl,
Got a letter from your mom the other day.
Her description did you proud: "At seventeen she is at the high end of meeting every parent's expectations, including mine," she wrote.
"An A student, captain of the tennis team, president of her high school service organization."
But her tone was despondent, disappointed and angry.
You've started to smoke, and she wants me to persuade you to stop.


Matthew A. Meyer; Publisher and Agent, 84
Matthew A. Meyer, a New York book publisher and literary agent, died on Friday at Charlene Manor, a nursing home in Greenfield, Mass.
He was 84.
The cause was heart failure, his family said.


Victor Seen In Santa Fe Bidding
The Union Pacific Corporation, once considered a long-shot spoiler in a bidding war to buy the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation, has emerged as the likely winner.
Union Pacific won a crucial agreement yesterday from Santa Fe officials to meet for the first time to share financial information and discuss terms of a merger of the railroad companies.


Cellular Fraud in New York
Cellular telephone fraud in New York City has become so rampant that a cellular service in Washington will temporarily block its customers from using their wireless phones when they travel in New York.
Cellular One of Washington-Baltimore, owned by SBC Communications Inc., has sent its customers letters notifying them that it would block the service beginning on Thursday because it had compiled a huge backlog of phone numbers used in New York that appeared to be fraudulent.


Red Apple to Sell Up to 20 Stores
Red Apple Group, owner of the Sloan's, Gristede's and Red Apple supermarket chains in New York City, will sell from 17 to 20 of its 75 stores to Rite-Aid, the nation's largest drugstore chain, in the next four months, the company's chief executive said yesterday.
Ten stores will be sold by Dec. 31, and 7 to 10 additional stores will be bought by Rite-Aid by the end of March and converted into drugstores, said John Catsimatidis, owner of the privately held supermarket unit, of which the Red Apple Group is the main holding company.
The terms of the deal were not disclosed.


Region Briefs; Jury Weighs Charges In Carpenter Murder Case
Jury deliberations began today in the retrial of a Larchmont carpenter charged with breaking into his childhood home and killing the couple that bought the house from his parents years before.

New York, Nostalgically
Some of the joys of growing up in New York City between the 1930's and the 1950's are on show in "Wish You Were Here," a nostalgia-marinated offering in WLIW's "New York the Way It Was" series.
Home movies, newsreels and, especially, smiling reminiscences picture the city and its watering places as a grand fun house for the young of all ages.


NBC Is Challenging Fox TV Operations As Foreign-Owned
In a direct challenge to the very existence of the Fox television network, NBC will file a petition with the Federal Communications Commission today asserting that the stations that form the heart of Fox are illegally foreign-owned.
NBC will ask the commission to rule either that Fox must drastically reduce its level of foreign ownership or that all other American networks may seek unlimited foreign investment.


Knicks Take Stutter Step in Right Direction
The Knicks built an 18-point lead tonight, but it almost wasn't enough.
Using a 16-0 run that started late in the third quarter and carried into the fourth, the Washington Bullets put a charge into the sellout crowd, while putting a scare into the Knicks.
But by making crucial plays during the last five minutes, New York held on for a 99-91 victory before 18,756 at the USAir Arena, sending the new-look Bullets (4-7) to their sixth consecutive defeat.

City Council Alters Anti-Smoking Bill, Easing Some Curbs
After a vigorous campaign by the tobacco industry and local restaurants, New York City Council leaders yesterday offered a revised anti-smoking bill that would loosen some proposed restrictions on smoking in restaurants and offices.
But it would still be much tougher than the current law, banning smoking in virtually all public places, including outdoor sports stadiums, zoos and bingo parlors.


Home Entertaining; How to Put Life In the Party, With Ease
AH, for the days of champagne and caviar, those halcyon 1980's, when a hostess needed only to produce a culinary extravaganza, summon professionally accomplished people to dinner and watch as the expensive food became the lodestar of powerful networking.
There was a certain ease in knowing that fabulous dinner parties could be bought.
But that ease is fading as the pendulum of popular taste swings away from conspicuous consumption.

Government-led or -sponsored prayer is an implicitly anti-Semitic step in the efforts of the Christian right to make America "a Christian nation," and is an explicit repudiation of Thomas Jefferson's opposition to tyranny over the mind of man.

Longtime Adviser Is Chosen To Serve as Pataki's Counsel

Finnegan is expected to play a central role in developing Mr.

In that role, the position of counsel would become much more powerful than it has been under Gov.

Revamping Set at Kmart Book Unit
Borders-Walden Inc., the big bookstore division of the Kmart Corporation, announced a major shake-up yesterday that industry officials said was intended to strengthen the bookseller for the public offering of its stock, presumably next year.
The reorganization is also intended to accelerate the growth of the "superstore," a free-standing store that carries as many as 100,000 titles, which has been highly successful for Barnes &amp; Noble Inc.


Don't Rush to Expand NATO
During the cold war there was no disagreement between America and its allies over NATO's purpose: It was Europe's shield against a common enemy.
The Serbs' war on Bosnia has exposed deep divisions among the Western powers over NATO's role and the question of European security.
Some U.S. policy makers believe that the way to revive NATO is to enlarge it by offering membership and the military guarantees that membership confers to a few countries in Eastern Europe.
Their rallying cry is "Expand or die."
That is a questionable idea.
If Washington continues to move in this direction, it is sure to generate more trans-Atlantic divisiveness.
It will burden NATO's existing members with risky new obligations.
Moreover, inviting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join will affront those who are likely to be left out, like Ukraine and the Baltic republics.
Worse yet, expansion could strengthen Russian nationalists opposed to Boris Yeltsin and his Western-oriented reformers.
The net result is that a larger NATO could diminish rather than strengthen European security.


Town Rife With Corruption, Panel Says
This borough has only 5,800 residents and a 10-member police force, but the State Commission of Investigation said today that that was enough to produce a hotbed of official misconduct, nepotism and an abuse of the public trust so pervasive that it threatened the municipality's financial stability.
After a 21-month investigation resulting from residents' complaints, the commission said it found that:

Confidence Index Has a Surge
One of the nation's two major consumer confidence indexes, which are intended to measure the optimism of Americans about their own financial situations, shot up in November to the highest level in more than four years.
The sudden surge in the index compiled by the Conference Board, to 101.3 from 89.1, might be an aberration.
But many pollsters and economists agreed on one point: Even without November's jump, the index shows that Americans feel better today about their circumstances than they did in 1993.
And they are not bracing for a recession -- although they might be expecting a slowdown next year.

Off the Menu
A Rreally Big Deal
In one of the year's more hotly contested restaurant contracts, CBS has selected Earl Geer, the president of Hi-Life Restaurants on the Upper East and West sides, to create and run a restaurant in the Ed Sullivan Theater, the current home of "Late Show With David Letterman." Originally, 42 restaurant operators were in the running, but Mr.
Geer was selected because, unlike many of the others, he wanted to do a television theme restaurant.
"He shared my vision for a place that would focus on the history of television," said Ed Grebow, CBS's executive vice president for operations.
The new restaurant, to be called Sullivan's Restaurant and Broadcast Lounge, will replace McGee's Pub, the restaurant under the theater marquee, at 1699 Broadway (at West 54th Street), whose lease is up in February.


Polenta With Guilt-Reduced Sausage
OVER the last few years, sausage makers have learned how to lower the fat in sausages without ruining the flavor.
Now, these reduced-fat sausages are available in almost every supermarket.

A good side dish is steamed brussels sprouts tossed with orange rind, orange juice and a touch of sugar.


A Man of the People, A Symbol of His Time
At his death at 56 in a 1935 Alaska plane crash, Will Rogers had been an unparalleled American phenomenon for more than two decades.
A career that included rodeos, vaudeville, radio, films, newspaper columns and a constantly touring form of stand-up comedy was capped with the distinction of being the highest-paid male movie star in Hollywood (and no matter the part, he always played Will Rogers).
Today, embalmed in the sad story of fated celebrity, Rogers is merely a curiosity, a corn-pone peg on which to hang a mediocre Broadway musical.


Jerry Rubin, 56, Flashy 60's Radical, Dies; 'Yippies' Founder and Chicago 7 Defendant
Jerry Rubin, the flamboyant 1960's radical who once preached distrust of "anyone over 30," died on Monday night in a Los Angeles hospital where he was being treated after having been struck by a car two weeks earlier.
He was 56 and lived in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles.
A hospital spokesman said the cause was cardiac arrest, but Mr.
Rubin had been unconscious and in critical condition since he was hit on the night of Nov. 14 while jaywalking across Wilshire Boulevard in the Westwood section of Los Angeles.
His former wife, Mimi Leonard Fleischman, said that he had suffered multiple injuries.


Horror, Horror on the Wall, Who's Etc.
Glenn Danzig sounds a little scarier than he looks.
His voice is a deep baritone, full of portentous Jim Morrison mannerisms, and his songs take up Satanism, death, sadomasochism and nearly everything else he could glean from old Black Sabbath records.
"I am a walking screaming hell/A thing of torture to behold" he vowed as his band, Danzig, started its set on Monday night at a sold-out Roseland.
Actually, he was a stocky, long-haired 35-year-old man with Elvis Presley sideburns, black jeans, cowboy boots and a rubber top that might have come from a wet suit, doing his best to glower as seriously as his songs required.
Mr.
Danzig first made his reputation in the 1970's leading the Misfits, a punk band with a horror-movie fixation.
Danzig is actually more old-fashioned; it draws on the blues-rock and heavy metal that punk-rock wanted to shake up.
The four-man band -- with John Christ on guitar, Eerie Von on bass and Joey Castillo on drums -- is breathtakingly predictable.
Every riff pounds its appointed number of times, every guitar solo delivers the appropriate squiggles.
The band knows its dynamics, inflating Mr.
Danzig's pronouncements with measured crescendos; its best gimmick, used sparingly, was to switch suddenly into double-time, which threw the mosh pit into a joyous frenzy.

Magazine Barred From Using Nude Photos of Clinton's Accuser
In a case that pits the freedom of the press against an individual's claim of privacy, a Federal judge in Manhattan yesterday ordered Penthouse magazine not to distribute photographs of a woman who has accused President Clinton of sexual harassment.

"It's obviously unconstitutional because it constitutes prior restraint," said Bob Guccione, the owner of Penthouse.

Personal Health; Sex after cancer: planning can make a major difference.
WHEN cancer is diagnosed, a person's first order of concern is naturally and appropriately survival.
But experts who deal with cancer survivors urge that another issue be considered at the outset: the effects of the cancer and its treatment on the person's sexual and reproductive future.
With the number of cancer survivors growing by the tens of thousands each year, post-cancer sexuality and fertility are matters of growing concern.
Yet few specialists who treat cancer discuss these issues with patients either before the therapeutic decisions are made or afterward, when the cancer is under control and concerns surface about the quality of life.


Blood Clot Lodged in Lung Sends Quayle to Hospital
Former Vice President Dan Quayle was admitted to the intensive care unit of an Indianapolis hospital on Monday evening for treatment of a blood clot in the right lung.

The 47-year-old former Vice President is expected to announce a bid for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination in the next few weeks.


The Met Tries To Reinvent An Opera Classic
It was, nearly, one of the most touching scenes in one of the most blindly passionate of operas.
Cio-Cio San, abandoned and nearly penniless, knelt by a picture of her long-absent husband, urging her servant to faith with an elaborate fantasy of Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton's return.
Catherine Malfitano made the aria "Un bel di" a wrenching revelation of Butterfly's delusion and desperation.
And yet something was missing.
Suddenly, toward the end of the aria, a man slipped alongside Ms.
Malfitano, shadowing the soprano's movements.
In the final bars, he reached down and gripped Pinkerton's portrait with trembling hands.
He stepped forward.
"Io con sicura fede l'aspetto," he sang.
"With unalterable faith, I wait for him."

In America; Business Beats Brooklyn
Final approval of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will tear a large hole in the Federal budget.
But this breach of the budget is not considered a major problem by Government leaders in Washington because the new GATT agreement will be a bonanza for big business, and that is something favored by Democrats and Republicans alike.
When benefits for working people or the poor are involved, the budget deficit is seen as an insurmountable problem.
There is no money for investments in ordinary Americans.
But the specter of $42 billion in lost tariff revenues over the next decade is met with a shrug by the movers and shakers in Congress and the White House.
As long as it's for business -- well, then, that's all right.

Banks Sees A Cure for The Blues For Browns
Carl Banks has experienced it all during his 11 years in the National Football League.
He won Super Bowls with the Giants in 1986 and 1990, and he endured a dismal 4-12 season last year as a member of the worst Redskins team in 30 years.
He went to the Pro Bowl in 1987 and was considered washed up last March when the Redskins released him with two years still remaining on his $5.4 million contract.
Now Banks, 32, is back on top again, a key member of a 9-3 Cleveland Browns team that appears headed for the playoffs and will meet the 5-7 Giants Sunday at Cleveland Stadium.
As the starting left outside linebacker, Banks is the fourth-leading tackler with 76, and he's being credited for providing the type of leadership and character that the Browns had been lacking.
Last Sunday, he earned a game ball for his six-tackle performance in the Browns' 34-10 victory over the Houston Oilers.

Instead, he said, he departed with "gratitude to my constituents who have given me what I think is one of the greatest honors in public life, to represent them here in the Capitol of the United States, in the House of Representatives."


From Eric Clapton, Blues Without the Bell-Bottoms
It took an even dozen songs for Eric Clapton to warm up on Monday night at Irving Plaza.
Mr.
Clapton, touring to support his blues album, "From the Cradle" (Reprise), has been doing small club dates in addition to stadiums; Monday night's show, in front of 454 people, ended his tour.
And for a good portion of it, he was engrossing not for what he played, but for what he didn't.
He was the snake that everybody knows will bite.
It was just a matter of waiting.
Mr.
Clapton started out by playing a slew of acoustic pieces, including Leroy Carr's "How Long Blues." He's a decent enough scholar, and he and his band have clearly gone back to the original recordings to figure out how they work.
They often work with understatement, and Mr.
Clapton rarely soloed, handing in restrained and precise performances.
He subordinated his personality to the music, taking idol worship out of the event and making the performance casual, even intimate.
Dressed in a white T-shirt and blue jeans, Mr.
Clapton was milking the anti-hero angle; he wore the same clothes for all three performances at Irving Plaza.


Market Place; Selloff Fails to Shake Stock Fund Investors
American investors may be growing more nervous about their stock market investments, but they keep putting money into equity mutual funds.
Even last week's sharp fall in stock prices produced only a relatively small amount of withdrawals, fund managers said yesterday.
That reluctance to get out no doubt helped to stabilize stocks, which recovered part of their losses after the Thanksgiving holiday.
At least since 1988, individual investors have shown a willingness to buy on dips, and that behavior continues.


Major and Rebel Tory Backbenchers Square Off Over Europe
A day after using a political bludgeon to beat back opposition within his own Conservative Party to win a Parliamentary vote on which he had staked his leadership, Prime Minister John Major today confronted the fallout from his tactics, including a technical loss of his majority in the House of Commons.
Making good on his promise to punish any Conservatives who failed to support the Government in Monday night's vote on increasing financing for the European Union, Mr.
Major effectively suspended from the party eight rebel Tories who abstained.
The eight rebels kept their seats in Parliament, but cannot participate in Conservative Party business and are threatened with being replaced as the party's candidates in the next election.


Apache To Buy Fields From Texaco
Texaco Inc. agreed yesterday to sell some 300 domestic oil and gas fields to the Apache Corporation for about $600 million.

Major oil companies have been increasing their attention abroad, investing billions of dollars in such areas as Russia and China, while leaving domestic fields to smaller and more nimble independent oil companies like Apache.


Breast Cancer Gene Isn't Making Screening Easy
LEST anybody nurse hopes that the wildly publicized discovery of the breast cancer gene two months ago will offer up new screening techniques or treatments any time soon, scientists caution that the gene is proving to be as frustrating and recalcitrant as the disease.

Rivers Rejoins Knicks' Rotation
Continuing to juggle their overcrowded roster, the Knicks activated Doc Rivers and Anthony Bonner today, and placed forward Ron Grandison and guard Charlie Ward on the injured list.
The move temporarily solved New York's roster problem, but it failed to end the speculation regarding Rivers, a 33-year-old point guard who is trying to come back from reconstructive left knee surgery.
It's unlikely that the Knicks will keep four point guards all season.
They may still make a deal involving Rivers or another guard, or Rivers might be waived if his knee doesn't hold up.
But being activated today was a pleasant surprise for Rivers, who wants to resume his career -- no matter where it leads him.

But with the Council poised to override Mr.
Giuliani's veto of its spending plan, Mr.
Hevesi questioned some of the Council's proposed cuts and urged the two sides to compromise rather than let the courts resolve their impasse.

Eating Well; Easy Ways To Have Healthier Holidays
VERY few people swear allegiance to a fat-free diet during the holidays or choose this time to straighten up their eating habits.

Forty percent thought they would gain weight -- an average of about four and a half pounds -- as a result.
Most men thought they would later shed those pounds; the women were less sure.

Pact in Spain Halts Airline Disruption
Spain's airports returned to normal today after the settlement of a paralyzing wildcat strike by Iberia airline employees on Monday that stranded more than 100,000 passengers.
The strike cost the financially troubled state airline $11.5 million in lost revenue and compensation to passengers and other carriers.
Unions representing 80 percent of Iberia's 24,000 employees reached a preliminary agreement with management at 3 A.M. after more than 11 hours of negotiations.
The cost-cutting compromises, which the unions had initially resisted, included scaled pay reductions averaging 8 percent and layoffs of 3,500 employees through early retirement and buyouts.

Left at Altar by Norway, Europe Tries Stiff Upper Lip
On Monday, Norway became the first country to say "no" to the European Union, and today the members of the club reacted with the frozen smiles of jilted suitors.
