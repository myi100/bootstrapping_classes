You may also have zucchini flowers, in which case you are lucky, because in Manhattan recently they were selling for $7.98 a half pound.

GOING FOR BROKE: WHEN A DECISION IS FINAL
LEAD: IN so many World War II movies, Jack Hawkins or another actor of his stripe brings in a young commando lieutenant and asks him what he knows about the drydock at Saint-Nazaire, France.

And then he sets that lieutenant and his men out to destroy one of those objectives.

These so-called ''ripple seats'' are in the front rows at all three of the National's theaters.

The Presidential Contenders Seek to Make Their Mark
LEAD: BY tradition, Labor Day is the opening day for general election campaigns.
Labor Day of the Presidential election year, that is.
The primary season begins some months earlier, when the primaries do, and the pre-primary period at some undefined time before that, generally the previous fall.

LEAD: POPE JOHN PAUL II WILL ARRIVE IN MIAMI on Thursday and be greeted by prelates, officials, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather.
Whatever else it may be, a papal visit is a media event.
This particular Pope is telegenic: He has a nice face, striking robes and a 2,000-year-old presence.
Cameras like him, and although he has publicly fretted about the ''manipulation and, consequently, evasion and hedonism'' that cameras can bring, he knows a thing or two about their uses.

Fossil Hunting in North Carolina
LEAD: The day had been long, our schedule grueling, the North Carolina sun unforgiving.

Bus Rider's Burden
LEAD: To the Editor:


POP AND JAZZ GUIDE
LEAD:  Charlie Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra, the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street (662-2133).
Billed as a 20th-anniversary celebration of the Liberation Music Orchestra, this concert isn't likely to confine itself to the band's original arrangements of Spanish Civil War songs and musical evocations of 60's political turbulence.

'I've Heard The Mermaids Singing'
IN its opening scenes, Patricia Rozema's ''I've Heard the Mermaids Singing'' displays a certain amount of engaging whimsy.
Polly Vandersma places herself in front of a home-video camera to tell us her story.
Polly is 31 years old, a self-described ''person Friday'' who's been called ''organizationally impaired'' by the agency that finds her employment as a ''temp.'' Polly can't type.
Her mind wanders.
Polly is the sort of young woman whose heart leaps up when she beholds diners through a restaurant window ''talking, laughing and interfacing.'' Sitting in a Japanese restaurant, before a table that's footstool-high, she doesn't know where to put her legs.
Polly is innocent beyond belief.
Yet she's so slyly and self-mockingly played by Sheila McCarthy, a very good new Canadian actress, that belief is willingly suspended.
For about 40 minutes.
Whimsy is unreliable.
Like a jolly drunk in a bar, it can turn suddenly aggressive.
Very soon Polly's innocence loses its charm, and watching this movie is like being cornered by a whimsical, 500-pound elf.

The Mets vs. the Cardinals; IT'S TIME FOR THE SHOWDOWN AT SHEA: Cards Missing Injured Clark
LEAD: With their hitting suddenly inconsistent and their first-place lead shrunken to a near crisis point, the St.

'Bluffing It,' on Illiteracy
LEAD: ILLITERACY is the subject of ''Bluffing It,'' another of those social-issue movies that have become the special province of television.
It's not the first made-for-television movie to deal with the subject.
Johnny Cash, the country singer, starred in a similar project several years ago.
And despite predictably upbeat endings, it remains to be seen whether such presentations contribute much to solving the problem.


3 Homers by Davis Can't Beat Padres
LEAD: Glenn Davis hit three home runs for the Houston Astros tonight, but the Padres won, 8-7, on a pinch-hit single with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning by Rob Nelson, in his first time at bat for San Diego, Davis became only the third Houston player, and first since Lee May on June 21, 1973, to hit three homers in a game.

Architecture: Early Modern on L.I.
LEAD: When the talk turns to modern architecture on Long Island, the usual focus, not surprisingly, is on the last few years.
For in the last generation modern architecture has come to dominate many of the beachfront communities at the eastern end of the island, and most of the houses it has left in its wake are so flashy and pretentious that they could make even a diehard modernist yearn for the calm of a few shingles and dormer windows.

Crawling With Corruption
LEAD: Corruption remains so familiar a fact of the construction industry in New York and other cities that it's easy to snicker at yet another official report detailing mob influence: dog bites man.

There cannot be very many displeased New Englanders when winter coats can be placed in storage and the National Basketball Association playoffs are the only remaining evidence of the winter that was left behind.

Owners Vote to Play On
LEAD: National Football League owners voted today to continue the season even if there is a strike, using players who have been cut or ''whatever players are available.'' Jack Donlan, executive director of the N.F.L.
Management Council, said, however, that the owners would continue to take whatever steps necessary to avoid a strike.

Lewis Continues Plea
LEAD: Carl Lewis, the American track star, continued his campaign against drug use in sports by suggesting yesterday in Brussels that an independent company be hired to conduct drug testing on a worldwide basis for amateur sports.
The company, he went on, should test not only for substances banned by the International Olympic Committee but also for drugs designed to mask the presence of banned substances.

Good Schools Make A Big Difference
LEAD: To the Editor:


Oxford Journal; Mystery Disease Ravages Oysters And Way of Life
LEAD: There was an audible gasp when the tongs filled with oysters broke the surface of the Chesapeake Bay and the dripping load was deposited with a clatter on the port-side culling board of the Miss Patrice.
Most of the oysters were dead, their shells agape and clogged with mud.


Restaurants
LEAD: MY experiences in most health-club restaurants lead me to suspect that their chefs are quietly in cahoots with the asparagus-thin aerobics instructors, whose job it is to inflict pain and help patrons shed weight.
It was with such limited expectations that I first jogged over to the new dining spot called Manhattan Island on the third floor of the Manhattan Plaza Health Club on West 43d Street, a short walk from both Broadway and Off

LEAD: Two months before this city's municipal elections, the question asked most often here is not whether Biagio (Ben) DiLieto will win a fifth term as Mayor, but by how large a landslide.


Film: 'Prayer for The Dying'
LEAD: THE things that attract attention in ''A Prayer for the Dying'' are not the things that should.
How could a thriller starring Mickey Rourke, Alan Bates and Bob Hoskins so distract its audience with accents, costumes and hairdos that effectively upstage the cast?
The most striking aspects of Mr.
Rourke's performance (as a reluctant Irish Republican Army terrorist) are the reddish hue of his hair and the harsh brogue, so different from his normally buttery voice that it almost sounds dubbed.


Hampton Still Swings At Age 78
LEAD: THE phone was ringing in Lionel Hampton's spacious midtown apartment for perhaps the 10th time in an hour.
Mr.
Hampton, who admits to being 78 years old and recently returned from leading his big band through a grueling bus tour of Europe, bounded up from the couch, as he had for every other phone call.

Estimate of Business Outlays Is Cut
LEAD: Business investment spending, hurt by rising interest rates and the adverse effect of the new tax law, will probably be even weaker this year than previously believed.


THE EVENING HOURS
LEAD: HOW long does it take to lure New York partygoers back into the social fray after holiday weekends, vacations, sojourns in the Hamptons, Connecticut, Europe?
Perhaps a day, if this week's revelries are any indication.
From tennis buffs to botanists, from photographers to socialites, New Yorkers picked up where they had left off in

Mercedes Sosa, born in the Andes in 1935, is a voice of Latin America's conscience.


Volcker's Spotlight Fame is fleeting.
LEAD: When Paul A. Volcker, from 1979 until last month the immensely powerful and widely respected chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, held a news conference yesterday to announce the membership of the new National Commission on Public Service that he has agreed to head, it was not like the old days.

Art: Jan Dibbets Show At the Guggenheim
LEAD: JAN DIBBETS is a Dutch artist, now 48 years old, who first came to international notice in 1971.
The pictures that he made were not quite like anyone else's.

Dumb objects were set free to talk and sing when Mr.


RESULTS PLUS
LEAD:  Golf  Stewart Surges to Tie: Ray Stewart, a 33-year-old Canadian struggling to retain his PGA Tour card, shot a six-under-par 65 yesterday to tie Curtis Strange and John Mahaffey for the opening-round lead in the $500,000 Bank of Boston Golf Classic in Sutton, Mass.

Finally, a Solid Foundation for Rutgers
LEAD: After having committed itself to big-time football a decade ago, Rutgers continues to pour money into its program without a lot to show for it.

What about this year?  ''Maybe,'' said Dick Anderson, the head coach, in a recent interview.

'Adult' Look in Hotel Films
LEAD: Granted, few travel-weary businessmen returning to their hotel rooms at night want to tune in ''Masterpiece Theater'' or ''Evening at Pops.'' But many, apparently, crave ''Emmanuelle IV,'' and other titillating movies.
In recent years, pay-for-view hotel movies have become a sudden hit, particularly the spicy ''adult entertainment'' fare, as movie suppliers call it.


A Preview in Doubles
LEAD: Lori McNeil and Steffi Graf, who will face each other in a singles semifinal today, received an unusual preview yesterday when they played a quarterfinal doubles match against each other.

President and G.O.P. Wary of Deficit Plan

NEW YORK REKINDLES DREAM OF A NEW MUNICIPAL TOWER

But now they have a little more foundation.


Tracking the Food Trends: They're Italian and Tropical
LEAD: NEW YORK sizzled in more ways than one during this tropical summer.
The restaurant industry, which ususally cools off to a dog-days torpor, raced full-throttle ahead, with more than 30 noteworthy openings (offset by about a dozen major closings).
This is not to say that the business is booming; on the contrary, times are relatively tough, according to restaurateurs and industry observers who point to a saturated marketplace, ballooning rents and growing price resistance among diners.

It's ugly.''


A Better Way Than Star Wars
LEAD: Now some major critics of President Reagan's Star Wars program have come up with a proposal of their own for strategic defense research.
It makes sense, and bolsters their claim that they aren't just opposed to S.D.I. because it's a Reagan obsession, or because they love the bomb, but for scientific, technical and budgetary reasons.


CORRECTIONS
LEAD: Because of an editing error, the Home Improvement column in The Home Section yesterday omitted a passage.
The affected paragraph should have read: ''Protect picture windows and sliding glass doors, both of which are subject to great wind pressure, with plywood shields.

TV: NO ONE STEALS THE POPE'S SCENES
LEAD: How has Pope John Paul II been playing on television?

SPIKE LEE'S STEREOTYPES
LEAD: Kudos to Spike Lee for not being afraid to ''show and tell'' it like it is.

A LONG LOOK
LEAD: A few seasons ago, designers in Italy and New York City started a major change in men's winter overcoats.

EVANESCENT SNARE OF A SPIDER'S WEB
LEAD: IT was a warm evening, and my friend and I had just returned from a restaurant on the Island.

BOOKS? SOVIET READERS JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THEM
LEAD: IN Soviet society, where basic items are can be hard to get and basic ideas can be dangerous to express, a book - good, bad or pulp - is an item with a value all its own.

WHICH IS BETTER, BASEBALL OR FOOTBALL?
LEAD: To my mind, there is no comparison; football is unquestionably superior.


Crime
LEAD: Don't be thrown off by the title.
LOVER MAN by Dallas Murphy (Scribners, $14.95) is not a romance.
Artie Deemer, the central character in this novel, is a suspect in a murder case, and the tough New York cop who is in charge of the investigation calls him ''lover man'' for no good reason.

LEAD: There are still three weeks left, still 21 games to play, but the Yankees probably saw their season drift away today under darkened skies and a brief rain shower at Exhibition Stadium.


Owning a Home Recedes As an Achievable Dream
LEAD: OF all the things that contribute to ''the good life,'' owning a home was cited more often than having a happy marriage or an interesting job, according to a national poll conducted last winter by the National Association of Realtors.
Though some might question the credibility of a poll that ranks ''a happy marriage'' just four percentage points higher than ''a yard or lawn,'' no one questions the finding that owning a home is an integral part of the

Directed by Liliana Cavani. 1972.
Rated R. Embassy Home Entertainment. 117 minutes. $24.95.
The jacket copy on this cassette breathlessly describes it as a ''taut, suspenseful sensual delight'' - presumably for the discerning viewer who finds rape, sadism and death camps delightfully sensual.

LEAD: Better voices than mine have answered that question with their pens: Lardner (''You Know Me, Al''), Malamud (''The Natural''), Roth (''The Great American Novel''), Thurber (''You Can Look It Up''), Potok (''The Chosen''), Coover (''The Universal Baseball Association'').

LEAD: When students return to the Bronx High School of Science this week, they will enter a building with 150 shattered windows - scars that give the city's most prestigious school an aura of neglect.

And like all city schools, Bronx Science, with its 2,750 students and 193 staff members, is swept only every other day.

FRESH TUNA STARS IN 'CANNED TUNA' ROLES
LEAD: THE availability of fresh tuna makes it a viable replacement for the canned variety in a number of recipes.
Although it cannot and should not be used in the traditional salad mixture calling for the canned tuna mashed nearly to a paste with mayonnaise, then made into a sandwich or a component of a salad plate, a stylish tuna salad to serve on a bed of lettuce is delicious when prepared with chunks of fresh tuna.

Music
LEAD: What sets New York apart from other American cities is not so much the abundance of first-rate musicians who troupe through town but the proliferation of small-scale local ensembles devoted to the performance of unusual repertory.

He repeats brand names -Star-Kist tuna, Hellmann's mayonnaise, Squibb mineral oil - while bouncing off the furniture in the ramshackle house that he shares with his older brother, Treat.
The character's name is Phillip, and in Lyle Kessler's drama ''Orphans,'' he is the shy youth with perpetually untied sneakers who just needs a little encouragement.


'20TH-CENTURY MASTER AMERICAN PHOTOGRAHS' IN STAMFORD
LEAD: THE exhibition at the Whitney Museum in Stamford is in some respects as routine as its title, ''Twentieth-Century Master American Photographs.''

LOT-SPLITTING IRKS GREAT NECK
LEAD: THE Great Neck peninsula as depicted in F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby'' is one of wealth and palatial mansions on sprawling estates.

FROM THE PAST, DELIGHTS FOR THE MIND AND EYE
LEAD: ALTHOUGH DANCE IS ONE OF THE oldest of the arts, dance history is a comparatively new field of study.

'ONE-PARTY SYSTEM' IS ROOT OF ILLS
LEAD: Reference is made to the recent controversy surrounding the filing of the nominating petitions for Democratic candidates in the Town of North Hempstead.

LEAD: A wider lapel, full-cut, tapering trousers, a generous slice of shirt front - these are a few of the details defining the new trans-Atlantic look.
And at a time when men's wear has struck a decisively cosmopolitan note, they may be the first visible signals of the wearer's savoir-faire.
The peripatetic life consisting of coast-to-coast commutes and business weekends abroad calls for this kind of cultural camouflage.


Giving Handouts To Governments
LEAD: SOME residents of Bolivar in Polk County, Mo., called it ''our Christmas dream come true.'' People who were good at figures said the city of 6,000 would share in a windfall of about $250,000 a year for 113 years.

Jailing a Judge
LEAD: Many politicians have tried over the last decade to facilitate the installation of cable television service in the outer boroughs of New York.
So far, two of them have been convicted of committing crimes in the process.
Last week, the first of those convicted, Justice Francis X. Smith, the former Queens administrative judge, was sentenced to serve a year in prison.

IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD:  ST.
JOHN DE CREVECOEUR: The Life of an American Farmer.
By Gay Wilson Allen and Roger Asselineau. (Viking, $19.95.) From Tocqueville and Chateaubriand to Romain Gary and Jean-Francois Revel, French writers have paid celebratory and caustic attention to America.
Two distinguished students of American culture have now collaborated on an agreeably written study of an 18th-century Frenchman, Michel-Guillaume Saint-Jean de Crevecoeur, who is the most interesting precursor of the better-known commentators who came after him.


Art
LEAD: Petah Coyne is a sculptor with rare imagination.
In her installation at the Sculpture Center (167 East 69th Street, through Sept. 31), she has concocted a forest of abstract, yet terribly concrete shapes that place us in a world that is part witches' sabbath, part hospital, part church.
The sculptures are compounds of earth, wood and hay.


New Baltimore Stadiums Likely
LEAD: Many baseball fans in Baltimore can now envision an opening day for the Orioles in 1990 with a better team and a new stadium.


Scientists Seek New Uses for Carbohydrates
LEAD: Every dieter's fantasy, a chocolate cake with two-thirds of the calories removed, is also a dream of researchers here.


Judge Bork Comes to Judgment
LEAD: Of course the Senate should scrutinize the views of Judge Robert Bork, President Reagan's nominee for the Supreme Court.
The Administration's pious protests aside, that would not inject politics into the judicial process.
Politics is already there - put there by the Constitution, which says appointments shall be made ''by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.


CATCHING DUMPERS AT SEA IS DIFFICULT
LEAD: ALTHOUGH Congress can pass stringent laws affecting illegal ocean dumpers -such as those who left a 50-mile swath of trash and medical waste off the New Jersey coast last month - there is little the Government can do to catch them, the Coast Guard says.


Four Hotels in the Grandest Manner. . .And Food Fit for Emperors
LEAD: There are nearly 20,000 restaurants in Hong Kong, a city where it may seem that every resident is a self-styled gourmet and that everyone eats out as often as possible.
The result is some of the very best cooking in the world, be it French, Italian or Vietnamese.


A Historic Hub Where the Sun Sets on Maui
LEAD: A wag, perusing a map of the Pacific, once ruefully remarked that the Hawaiian islands were the ''furthest near islands'' he could find.
Queried why, then, he was journeying 2,100 miles from his home base in San Francisco to visit, he replied that he had been enticed there by Mark Twain who described Hawaii as ''the loveliest fleet of islands that lies anchored in any ocean.

We also agreed that a 2 percent handling fee would be charged on the escrow account containing the security deposit.


Loophole Mentalities
LEAD: ''You know the rule: no sugary snacks before dinner.''


SPIKE LEE'S STEREOTYPES
LEAD: Film director Spike Lee opposes the film establishment's portrayal of black society in a ''shallow,'' ''misleading'' manner (''Spike Lee's Gotta Have It,'' by Stuart Mieher, Aug. 9).
He then projects a black society made up of well-to-do, light-complexioned people and poorer, darker people.
He uses two terms, ''wannabees'' and ''jigaboos,'' to describe these stereotypes, which, if they had been used by a white film director, would have caused the black community to picket this movie as a sociological outrage.


Gunmen Kill Peter Tosh, Reggae Star, in Jamaica
LEAD: Peter Tosh, a founding member of the Wailers, a reggae group that helped to popularize the vibrant Jamaican music style internationally, was killed at his home Friday night by gunmen, the police said.

HIGH E.R.A. SHOULDN'T DISCOUNT RAWLEY IN CY YOUNG VOTING
LEAD: THE time may have arrived to throw out a statistic that has always been one of baseball's most treasured barometers - earned run average.
In this new era of broken-bat home runs and 425-foot opposite-field home runs, a pitcher's e.r.a. has lost most of its meaning.


Staten Island Nurses Strike
LEAD: About 200 nurses went on strike at Richmond Memorial Hospital on Staten Island late Friday night.
The walkout came after labor talks broke down because of a dispute over the nurses' workload in the intensive care and coronary care units, said Larry Nathan, a lawyer for the nurses union.
The hospital said that management and nonunion nurses were filling in for the strikers and that its operations had not been disrupted.


BRAZILIANS STRUGGLE AGAINST GLOOM AND ECONOMIC DISARRAY
LEAD: AFTER surviving two decades of military dictatorship, Brazil's innate sense of optimism has been battered by the political uncertainty and economic disarray that have followed the return of civilian rule 30 months ago.

A Gay 'Love Story'
LEAD: E. M. FORSTER'S LITERARY EXECUTORS -the distinguished Fellows of King's College, Cambridge - were reportedly delighted by the film that Ismail Merchant and James Ivory made of his ''Room With a View.'' But when the two men approached them for permission to adapt the great novelist's ''Maurice'' for the screen, all was donnish consternation and dismay.


Gooden Routed, 8-1; Mets Fall 3 1/2 Back
LEAD: Not many hours after they blew a lead in the ninth inning and a game in the 10th, the Mets were struck by the ultimate and maybe even the unthinkable shock yesterday: Dwight Gooden was knocked out in two innings, and the Mets lost for the second straight time to the St.
Louis Cardinals, 8-1.


OUR ORCHESTRAS ARE SPLINTERING
LEAD: REVOLUTIONS IN MUSIC DO occur.
Let's see.
There was Schoenberg's invention of the 12-tone method in the 1920's and, before that, Cipriano de Rore's rediscovery in the 16th century of the ancient Greek practice of letting words govern music, a notion that eventually gave birth to opera.
I'm sure a case could be made for one or two other such events.

The Bork Philosophy: Personal Privacy and Majority Rule
LEAD: Judge Robert H. Bork provided a key example of how his judicial philosophy works in practice in a 1971 article in the Indiana Law Journal.
In criticizing a major 1965 Supreme Court decision on the right to marital privacy, he stressed the importance of majority rule.
He has repeated this criticism in recent years.


Patricia Samuel Wed to Alan R. Steele

ANOTHER STEPS INTO ENCHANTED MORNING
LEAD: THE small cry woke us even earlier than usual.
Our infant son had given us some extra evening time for ourselves the night before by putting himself out early.
He called the favor by awakening for his morning feeding at about 4:30 rather than his usual 6:15.
My wife, who had a busy day schedule, groaned and suggested that I do the feeding.

Rheims
LEAD: To the Editor: I realize that Richard Bernstein's article on Rheims (Travel, Aug. 2) was not intended to be all inclusive, but I think your readers should visit Rheims's Salle de Guerre, where the German Army surrendered to the Allies on May 7, 1945, effectively ending the Second World War in Europe.

NAVRATILOVA TOPS GRAF FOR OPEN TITLE
LEAD: Bit by bit, Steffi Graf's seeming invincibility had been challenged.
First by a quarterfinal opponent who conceived the proper strategy but couldn't execute it.
Then by a player who tested Graf's skills and perhaps dented her confidence in the semifinals.
Finally, in blustery conditions yesterday at the National Tennis Center, Martina Navratilova combined strategy and execution into a convincing triumph over the world's top-ranked female tennis player.


Tennis Thrives By Examples

SUMMER'S PORTENTS OF MONEY AND SEX
LEAD: IT'S CERTAINLY SOBERING TO glance backward at the newspapers of several months ago and see the projected big hits of the summer - ''Harry and the Hendersons,'' ''Who's That Girl,'' ''Ishtar'' - twinkling on the horizon.
Needless to say, things never work out as planned.
That was especially true in a summer without familiar landmarks, with no ''Saturday Night Live'' comedy spinoff or Paramount musical (unless you count ''Beverly Hills Cop II'' in both categories), no kiddie-oriented blockbuster and Sylvester


CAN A PATRIARCHAL AURA CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN A POPE AND HIS FLOCK?
LEAD: TWO widely divergent portraits of America's Roman Catholics emerged last week as Pope John Paul II arrived for a 10-day pastoral visit, his second to the United States.

TWO GIANTS OF MODERNISM AT OPPOSITE POLES
LEAD: ONE OF THE BENEFICIAL SIDE effects of living in a post-modern age is that we can look back on the accomplishments of Modernism with fresh eyes - and, in some cases, fresh appreciation.
This is as true in photography as it is in the other visual arts, and this season it is especially true of the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson and Edward

'20TH-CENTURY MASTER AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHS' IN STAMFORD
LEAD: THE exhibition at the Whitney Museum in Stamford, Conn., is in some respects as routine as its title, ''Twentieth-Century Master American Photographs.'' A selection of 86 mainly black-and-white prints, it surveys photography's metamorphosis into high art - assuming the change has been in the product and not, as seems more likely, in the public's perception of it.


WIDE BACKING SEEN FOR WELFARE PLAN

KNICKS SEEKING SITE ON PURCHASE CAMPUS
LEAD: FOR the Knicks, who finished with a 24-58 record last season, practice did not always make perfect.

A Guide to Antique Shops . . .

THE VERDICT ON CREATIONISM

IN WESTBROOK, SEAFOOD BY THE SEA
LEAD: BORDERED as Connecticut is by Long Island Sound, shore dining should be plentiful.

The station officially went on the air as what is now known as a public-TV operation on Sept. 16, 1962.
Edward R. Murrow, no less, the very symbol of integrity at CBS News, was on camera that evening to tell viewers that the new venture - then called WNDT, for New Dimensions in Television - was ''born with the excitement of the creative, the promise of the newfound, the challenge of the untried.


A Primrose Path Leads Toward Disaster
LEAD: A recent announcement that Zia Mahmood of Pakistan had been voted the Royal Viking ''Player of the Year'' for 1986 came as no surprise.

Pollution of Summer '87 Seen as Oceanic Warning
LEAD: Along the East Coast, where tides have been running an ugly brown and garbage washes ashore, where some waters have become unsafe for swimming and lethal to a multitude of fish, the summer of 1987 should be viewed as a cautionary tale, environmental experts and Government officials say.

STOKOWSKI'S OTHER LEGACY

The Dance: Judy Trupin
LEAD: JUDY TRUPIN combined choreography with spoken texts in the works that the Extrapolating Movement Theater offered Wednesday night at the Rapp Arts Center.
At their best, these pieces were goofy and satirical.


AWAKENING FROM THE TRAFFIC NIGHTMARE
LEAD: ANYONE who has traveled Connecticut's Southwest Corridor knows first hand about the region's traffic congestion.
While some local residents are steadfastly against any expansion of the Merritt Parkway or I-95, it is inevitable that some form of improvement is necessary and eventually must take place if we are to alleviate the current traffic nightmare.

Talking Breads - and Peas and Port
LEAD: DEPARTMENT stores have long used alarm-triggering hard tags on clothing to deter shoplifters.

FOR CHAGALL, AN END TO ARTISTIC EXILE

LEAD: ALL THE MAJOR RECORD companies and some of the smaller ones are now competing against themselves with rapidly growing catalogues of what they generally term ''midprice'' compact disks, which retail for about $10 in many stores, compared with $13 to $18 for full-priced disks.
Unlike the earliest budget-priced long-playing vinyl records in the first days of the LP era, which usually featured little-known artists and orchestras, many of the midpriced CD's offer celebrated names and notable performances, usually with first-class sonics.

TROUBLESHOOTING FLUORESCENT LIGHTS
LEAD: FLUORESCENT lights work differently from incandescent ones.
As a result, tubes last much longer than ordinary light bulbs and are far less likely to be the cause of trouble - even when the lights won't work at all - than some of a fixture's other components.


IN SHORT: FICTION
LEAD: SINGING ON THE TITANIC.
By Perry Glasser. (University of Illinois, $11.95.) As the Titanic sank, the passengers on board sang hymns - surely an affirmative act in the face of impossible odds.
And in almost all the stories in Perry Glasser's second collection the characters respond with the same optimism, their actions colored by the experience of loss or by the precariousness of their inner balance.


A Real Estate Fraud in the Bronx Is a New Twist on an Old
LEAD: On the streets of Riverdale and other affluent sections of the Bronx, a resourceful man, well dressed and worldly, is making thousands of dollars, using what the police say is a new twist in a ruse just about as old as New York: the confidence game.

When Things Go Right
LEAD: MY 40TH BIRTHDAY was approaching, and I knew exactly how I would celebrate: My husband, Walter, and I would invite a small group of friends for a two-day fete at our farmhouse in Provence.
We would feast outdoors on local, seasonal bounty as we looked out on the vineyards and Mont Ventoux.
It turned out to be one of those rare weekends when everything that could have gone right went right, and sometimes even better than right.


Iran Says It Is Expanding Its Ability to Make Arms
LEAD: Iran is steadily increasing its ability to make weapons at home, diverting domestic industrial plants to the task to try to become self-sufficient, a high-ranking minister says.


Comings and Goings
LEAD: IN what might be described as the feat of the week, Don Hodes, a 32-year-old lawyer from Corona del Mar, Calif., said he would try to become the first American to walk across the English Channel, a stroll he plans for Tuesday while wearing a pair of miniature kayaks or foot floats known as skijaks.


New Chief Lends Militancy to Vermont Tribe
LEAD: The Abenaki Indians of northwestern Vermont have elected, by a vote of 144 to 141, a tribal chief who says he is ''sick of dealing with the white man'' and who is seen as representing a more militant faction of the tribe of 2,200 people.


Mystic Town Houses: Stargazer's Specials
LEAD: A community of 189 two-story town houses called Bishop's Cove is under development in Mystic, Conn., near the Rhode Island border, and it should appeal to people who like to gaze at stars; each of the units will have 11 skylights.

The Incongruous 'We'
LEAD: THE MOST VEXED, loaded and crucial word of the United States Constitution is a two-letter word that I used too blithely, once, in argument with a friend of mine.


An Ingenious Structure
LEAD: IT IS OUR ROCK AND OUR REDEEMER, THE civil religion of a society that has no state church.
It is a unifying symbol as powerful in our diverse Republic as the queen in a monarchy.
It is history: roots for a country with little sense of the past.


Residential 'Wall' Rises Along West 42d
LEAD: IN many minds, all of West 42d Street whirs with a nonstop raffishness.
It is a crossroads for panhandlers, runaways, hawkers, prostitutes, drug dealers, pleasure seekers, commuters and travelers.


MICHIGAN UPSET BY NOTRE DAME
LEAD: Terry Andrysiak completed 11 of 15 passes for 137 yards, including an 11-yard touchdown toss to Tim Brown, as Notre Dame scored a 26-7 upset victory over Michigan today.

Wall Street's Newest Magic Show
LEAD: WITH the fervor of mad scientists trying to crack a code of nature, Wall Street's investment bankers are in a headlong race to find gold in the $400 billion Latin American bank debt.

NDJAMENA SENDS TROOPS INTO LIBYA
LEAD: Chad, a landlocked equatorial African country of 5 million with a per capita income of less than $100 a year, had rarely attracted world attention in its 27 years of independence until it started fighting with its neighbor Libya several years ago.
The concern is not so much over Chad, which has little to buy and sell in the world, but with its enemy's leader, Col.


Amendment Addendum
LEAD: Patriots never boast about the last 10 amendments to the Constitution.
It is the first 10 that get all the praise.
Taken together, they make up the Bill of Rights and testify to the nobility of American political thought in the 18th century.
By contrast, the last 10 amendments, all adopted since 1913, testify to its ruin and decay in the 20th.


In Re: Bork Witch Hunt
LEAD: Judge Robert Bork, a jurist of uncommon intellect and strong views about judicial restraint, has become the target of ideologues and pressure groups out to besmear his character and distort his record.


NEBRASKA DEFEATS U.C.L.A.

LONG ISLAND GUIDE
LEAD:  QUILTING TODAY  With fads in folk art seemingly cyclical, the wheel of fortune has now alighted on quilts and quilting, at least on the East End, where there's enough interest on the part of artisans, collectors and, apparently, the public to prompt three exhibitions devoted to this American craft.


A VIEWER'S RESPONSE IS DESCRIBED
LEAD: I believe that The Times owes Legislator Feiner an apology for the tone of the article, ''Cable TV Campaign Criticized.'' Mr.
Feiner is not waging a one-man battle.

Ever since the Congress deprived local commissions of the right to set

Discovering the Other India
LEAD: When tourists think of India, they usually conjure up images of Hindu bathers on the sacred Ganges River, or houseboats in the shadow of the Himalayan foothills, or ancient forts and maharajah's palaces rising up from the desert.
Relatively few make much room for a part of India that offers adventures, a different but no less exotic blend of spices, silks and religious fervor, and what many feel is the essence of

LEAD: The government of the northeastern state of Assam is demanding that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi block the migration of other Indians to the area, and deport millions of immigrants from Bangladesh.


FRESH TUNA STARS IN 'CANNED TUNA' ROLES
LEAD: THE availability of fresh tuna makes it a viable replacement for the canned variety in a number of recipes.
Although it cannot and should not be used in the traditional salad mixture calling for the canned tuna mashed nearly to a paste with mayonnaise, then made into a sandwich or a component of a salad plate, a stylish tuna salad to serve on a bed of lettuce is delicious when prepared with chunks of fresh tuna.


Counted Out
LEAD: AS a linebacker at the University of Oklahoma, he brought fame to his jersey, No. 44.
So when Brian Bosworth signed a multimillion-dollar contract with Seattle, it came as no surprise that he picked the same number for his Seahawks jersey and moved to cash in on its fame.
He named his personal corporation 44 Boz Inc., signed a contract for production of a line of 44 Blues sunglasses, posed in his No.

LEAD:  THE RULES OF ATTRACTION  By Bret Easton Ellis. 283 pp.
New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. $17.95.


Dining Out Under the 80 Percent Rule
LEAD: THE provision of the new tax law that limits the deduction for business meals to 80 percent of the cost has been in force for about eight months, and so far the main effect has been to create an enormous paperwork burden as accounting systems are adjusted for the change.


Photography
LEAD: It's axiomatic that parents love to take pictures of their children.
But very few parents would want to go as far as Sally Mann, whose photographs of her three youngsters trespass the conventions of family snapshooting in several intriguing ways.
For starters, Mann uses an 8-by-10-inch view camera, which is an awkward instrument for snapshots but just the thing for rendering skin and other textures with great fidelity.


Store Front Museum of Queens Is Target of Inquiry
LEAD: For 16 years the Store Front Museum was a center for black art and culture in Jamaica, Queens.
Its offerings ranged from paintings to black-history programs, from a 30-foot-long African canoe to a photographic exhibition on blacks in Queens.

R.E.M. CONJURES DARK TIMES ON 'DOCUMENT'
LEAD: ''THERE'S ENOUGH MEDIA and there's enough music that presents itself to you as 100 percent complete,'' said Michael Stipe, R.E.M.'s singer and lyricist. ''We've been trained to accept that and not question that.
If you're blasted into the public eye, you're supposed to be one-dimensional.
But I'm pretty big on people contributing to things that they take in - not just accepting them on face value.


Stage: 'Why to Refuse,' an Allegory
LEAD: FOR a playwright to cast himself as the self-martyred central character in his own drama takes considerable nerve.
But when that character spends most of his time on the stage naked, that decision seems more than an act of daring.
It smacks of angry, exhibitionistic desperation.


DIFFERENT MESSAGES TO THE HIGH-TECH GOD
LEAD: ''SHOW me a man with no irregular heart beats, and I'll show you a heartless man.''


WHICH IS BETTER, BASEBALL OR FOOTBALL?
LEAD: I am a middle-aged Labrador retriever who likes to nap while my folks watch TV.
When they view a baseball game, all is quiet and I suspect they nap, too - boredom.
But when they watch a football game, there is so much excitement and cheering, I am constantly awakened.

LEAD: After months of deliberation, negotiators for the Daily News and its largest union agreed yesterday on a proposed three-year contract that would save the financially troubled paper $18 million and give the drivers no raise in pay this year.


THE ENIGMA OF KURT WEILL
LEAD: FOR SEVERAL PERFECTLY plausible reasons, Kurt Weill (1900-1950) remains an enigma to most music lovers, with much of his work unknown and unheard.
Yes, they link his name with Lotte Lenya and ''The Threepenny Opera,'' with ''The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny'' (especially if they happen to be Metropolitan Opera regulars) and maybe - if their memories stretch back far enough - with ''September Song'' and a few dimly remembered Broadway musicals.

LEAD: IN the old days, security guards would pad around department stores, wearing out the soles of their shoes and, at night, the batteries in their flashlights.
Today they watch television.


COURSE IS OFFERED ON DETERRING RAPE
LEAD: ROBERT MURIE says that he does not teach rape prevention, just a short, fast way to protect oneself during an attack or how to avoid one.
But the 34-year-old casino security aide is the first to admit that the best defense is sometimes a good offense.


A GOLDEN AGE OF SILVER
LEAD: SUMPTUOUS SILVER tablewares and commemorative vessels - awash with cherubs, dragons, exotic flowers and rococo flourishes - were all the rage in late 19th-century America.
This ostentatious taste was fully exploited by one of the most successful entrepreneurs of the day - Charles Lewis Tiffany, founder of the Fifth

GLOSSARY OF A SCANDAL
LEAD: It is rare that one finds inspired figures of speech ascribed to such ponderous speakers as our forthright Secretary of State, yet William Safire credits George P. Shultz with a ''creative oxymoron'' in the Secretary's description of Elliot Abrams's testimony as ''a combative apology.'' Mr.
Shultz was apparently using the word ''apology'' in its original sense of justification or excuse, and not as expressive of regret; Shultz's phrase was more accurate than colorful.

As a result, tubes last much longer than ordinary light bulbs and are far less likely to be the cause of trouble - even when the lights won't work at all - than some of a fixture's other components.

Fight Over Cup: By Land, Then by Sea
LEAD: A lull as ominous as the eye of a hurricane has settled around plans for America's Cup competition.
Efforts on Friday by the San Diego Yacht Club to set a time and place for the next series - May 1991 in San Diego - answered long-posed questions.
But the club's game plan is still surrounded by winds of discord.

THE RANK AND FILE BUY SHARES IN THATCHERISM
LEAD: ONE of last year's keynote speakers was notably absent from the rostrum when Britain's once-powerful trade unions met last week at Blackpool for their annual conference.
Neil Kinnock, the Labor Party leader, attended the conference, but kept a relatively low profile, which seemed to underline how much the traditional bonds between the British union movement and the party it created at the turn of the century are loosening in the face of the economic and political changes wrought by

FOUR 'FORZAS' WITH PLUSES AND MINUSES
LEAD: ''LA FORZA DEL DESTINO'' IS really two operas: One, including all the beloved arias and duets, belongs to a soprano, tenor and baritone locked in fatal conflict - people descended from the furious heroes of Verdi's early works.
The other, in which Verdi stretched his muscles toward the style that eventually gave us ''Don Carlos,'' the revised ''Simon Boccanegra'' and ''Falstaff,'' slaps these tragic figures up against peoples, armies and a collection of characters that could hardly have existed in any earlier

B.F. SKINNER INSISTS IT'S JUST MATTER OVER MIND
LEAD: FROM the 1930's through the 1960's, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism, whose more extreme proponents held that the mind is but a convenient fiction.
Primitive tribes imagined that invisible spirits were responsible for wind, rain and other mysteries.
And so, the behaviorists argued, we try to explain the complexities of human behavior by positing the existence of a mental ectoplasm that inexplicably dwells in our heads.

HARDBALL ON WALL STREET
LEAD: I meet many men like Robert Minicucci in my practice as a marriage therapist -rich yuppies with poor personal relationships.

FRESH TUNA STARS IN 'CANNED TUNA' ROLES
LEAD: THE availability of fresh tuna makes it a viable replacement for the canned variety in a number of recipes.
Although it cannot and should not be used in the traditional salad mixture calling for the canned tuna mashed nearly to a paste with mayonnaise, then made into a sandwich or a component of a salad plate, a stylish tuna salad to serve on a bed of lettuce is delicious when prepared with chunks of fresh tuna.

This slim memoir is as spirited, appealing and shrewdly elusive as its author.

PART-TIME TEACHER: A TROUBLING PATTERN

Let's finish the treaty to eliminate medium-range missiles this year, he says, and deal with strategic defenses and offenses next year.

Film: 'Pickup Artist,' From James Toback
LEAD: WATCH the actors' lips as they deliver their lines in ''The Pickup Artist,'' which opens today at the Criterion Center and other theaters, and you'll sometimes see them mouthing words that didn't make it into the finished film.
Something seems to have happened en route to the screen. ''The Pickup Artist'' is extremely brief -under 90 minutes - and a good deal tamer than the earlier works of James Toback, who wrote ''The Gambler'' and directed ''Fingers,'' ''Love and Money'' and ''Exposed,'' films not known for the kind of nice-guy romantic humor he displays this time.

The sophisticated singing and songwriting trio from Seattle writes delightfully fey folk-pop songs that suggest Gilbert and Sullivan filtered through the Roches, with a soupcon of Stephen Sondheim.

Restaurants
LEAD: WITH all the ballyhoo over Tex-Mex, Southwestern and Mexican restaurants in recent years, the zesty cuisine of Cuba has been somewhat neglected.

The granddaddy of this tropical cuisine in New York is Victor del Corral, who opened the original Victor's Cafe 25 years ago on Columbus

Art: From Sherrie Levine, a Mini-Retrospective
LEAD: SHERRIE LEVINE'S widely anticipated first exhibition at the Mary Boone Gallery is more a mini-retrospective than a presentation of new works.

Film: Norman Mailer's 'Tough Guys Don't Dance'
LEAD: ''I KEEP saying to myself,'' muses Tim Madden, ''death is a celebration.'' Tim (Ryan O'Neal), ex-con, ex-bartender and would-be writer, does a lot of rather portentous musing in ''Tough Guys Don't Dance,'' Norman Mailer's Cape Cod film noir that, with a body count of five murders and two suicides, turns out to be a fairly continuous celebration, though of what is not always apparent.

Film: 'Maurice' in Style Of Ivory and Merchant
LEAD: STATELY and tasteful, supremely confident, proud of its Anglophilia and shameless in its devotion to the upper crust, the Merchant-Ivory style of literary adaptation by now owes at least as much to Ralph Lauren as to E. M. Forster or Henry James.
That's no small part of its appeal.
The Merchant-Ivory ''Maurice,'' based on Forster's long-unpublished novel about a young man's coming to terms with his homosexuality, further perfects the approach that has worked better and better with each new film, particularly ''The Bostonians'' and ''A Room With a View.


POP AND JAZZ GUIDE

Maintaining such a balance is not easy.

LEAD: Three years ago, while making a 12-day tour of Canada, Pope John Paul II was scheduled to celebrate a mass for Indians in a ceremonial tepee set up on a tribal meeting ground here beside the Mackenzie River.
But the fog that often blankets this tiny community just 350 miles south of the Arctic Circle, prevented the Pope's aircraft from landing.


On the Trail of Great Indian Art
LEAD: Twenty years ago I sailed up the Northwest Coast in the unlikeliest of vessels - a 100-foot medical mission boat borrowed from the United Church of Canada.
It was crewed by two Kwakiutl Indians who knew much more about the jagged, often fogbound Inner Passage than the charts did.
Sometimes we held our breath as our keel scraped across a reef that, according to the charts, should have prevented us from entering one of the long, narrow fjords that are called canals in British Columbia.

LEAD: DESPITE the efforts of educators, the concerted attempts of law-enforcement agencies and special citizen human-interest groups, the problem of ''visible bigotry'' and the impact of bias crime on what are too often youthful victims, as well as youthful offenders, remains a problem that frustrates attempts at any ''quick fix.


CAN THE GIANTS REPEAT AS CHAMPIONS?

A New Friend From the Old Country
LEAD: Banners bearing the red and white colors of Poland fluttered overhead and signs proclaiming ''Solidarnosc'' were waved vigorously.

Rock's Walk on the Safe Side
LEAD: ROCK USED TO BE THE life of the party.
It would saunter in, holler ''Let the good times roll!,'' and goad people to dance and shout and run wild.
Since the 1950's, rock has sketched fantasies of power, mobility and pleasure with no boundaries, no consequences.
Every guy grabs a girl, everywhere around the world; honky-tonk women are ready and waiting; it's time for a walk on the wild side, and you can't catch me.

Yet cassettes remain by far the most popular medium for recorded music, and prerecorded cassettes outsell both CD's and LP's throughout the world.

When Brezhnev Came to Call
LEAD: IT has happened before: A Republican President in political trouble receives the leader of the nation he has portrayed as public enemy No. 1, and tensions dissipate for a time.

LEAD: ''The tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle, formed a picture such as one sees in Salvator Rosa's landscapes only.

It's all part of the lighthearted approach to dressing up.


Busting Into the Big Leagues

Singleton owning roughly one-third of that.

CAN THE GIANTS REPEAT AS CHAMPIONS?
LEAD: The Giants are as likely to repeat as Super Bowl champions as Ronald Reagan is to retain his Presidency in '88.

Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''The trouble with a campaign is you have to sell yourself.
I find it very distasteful.

I don't like it, I don't like it.''
- Governor Cuomo.


STILL MASTROIANNI
LEAD: OVER THE YEARS, MARCELLO Mastroianni has talked about his farm near Lucca in central Italy: ''When I go there, I put on a velour jacket like my grandfather.

BEING CATHOLIC IN AMERICA
LEAD: Much of Joseph Berger's article centers around the beliefs and concerns of Dr.
Barbara Devine, a well educated, modern American Catholic.
The problem is that her last formal Catholic education was at the high-school level.
Would she accept the recommendations of a high-school graduate on the proper method for a complex dental procedure?


The Big Mac of Adult Education
LEAD: ANY educational institution can offer a course in ethics.
Apparently only one has ever taught ''How to Cheat on Your Spouse.'' ''The first thing the teacher said was: 'How many of you paid for this class with a credit card?' '' said William Zanker, the 33-year-old president and founder of The Learning Annex Inc., which offered the class.


Jazz: Marc Cohen, Pianist
LEAD: THE piano style of Bill Evans lives on in the playing of Marc Cohen.
Most pianists since the 1950's have been affected in some way by Evans's subtle, chromatic harmonies, but Mr.
Cohen goes further.
He has embraced the velvet-slippered Evans touch and, more difficult, the way Evans would develop solos, in introspective wisps and airy abstractions that left a song's chord changes far away.


Pegasus to Cryptoclearance

The trainer found one tonight at The Meadowlands.


BEING CATHOLIC IN AMERICA
LEAD: Joseph Berger's article pictures a white, middle-class Catholic Church with a massive attack of ego.

Rock: The Radiators
LEAD: FROM their native New Orleans to points far north, the Radiators have been packing clubs and dance floors for 10 years.

Headliners; Moving Slowly
LEAD: If Joseph S. Gruss exercised caution over the years as he made a fortune in investment banking, he has exercised no less care in giving it away.

FICTION
LEAD:  CUSTOMS VIOLATION.
By Janice Weber. (Donald I. Fine, $17.95.) Sexual rancor can be extremely amusing, and luckily a few writers know it.
Harold Pinter is one, and another is Janice Weber, who exploits the jolly mental state in her second novel, ''Customs Violation.''

Strategic Metals Stoke the Boiler Rooms
LEAD: THE rumblings out of Africa about possible supply interruptions of strategic metals - the likes of chromium, cobalt and platinum upon which Western nations depend for industry and military uses - may raise the pulses of sophisticated traders in London, at least for an afternoon.

A few months short of turning 40, after years of injuries and after performing less and less frequently with the American Ballet Theater in New York, Mikhail Baryshnikov is not the dancer we first saw here in 1974.
But that is the image we all still carry in our minds.


Hard Times for the Euromarkets

In one major sector of the Euromarkets, for floating-rate notes, roughly a quarter of the people have lost their jobs in the past year.

CAN THE GIANTS REPEAT AS CHAMPIONS?

Lost Among The Carnivores In Yugoslavia
LEAD: Some people manage to travel in a totally carefree way.
I don't.
Where others happily contemplate crossing the Sahara with nothing more than a box of cookies, a light novel and equanimity, I assume there will be problems.
Lots of them.
Oh, not the sort of problems that would get my name in the papers, not tribal warfare or death from thirst, but little, everyday problems.


New Money, Old Digs
LEAD: THERE'S hardly a morning along the River Thames near Tower Bridge that doesn't have a Turneresque quality about it, with a weak sun filtering through the haze.

Vancouver's Seaside Towns, Rugged Wilds
LEAD: Many travelers are familiar with the capital of Vancouver Island, the clean, pretty city of Victoria, with its British influences and traditions; fewer are aware of the rest of the 285-mile-long island off Canada's west coast.
Seaside towns along the east coast contrast with the wilderness on its west; snow-capped mountains form the island's spine and clear lakes dot its body.


NEWS SUMMARY: SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1987

ART
LEAD: It is common ground among those who know his work well that Ferdinand Hodler (1853-1918) was one of the great European painters of his day.
Yet in the United States he has almost no name at all.
Rare in American museums, his work is rarer still in the dealers' galleries.
The auction industry has yet to catch up with him.


Outdoors; Diagnosis for Ailing Eelgrass
LEAD: THE source of a disease that threatens eelgrass beds along the East Coast has been positively identified, giving cause for celebration.

The Interminable Term
LEAD: THE THIRD WEEK OF September was always the nightmare week.
All the excitement of going back to school was gone.

A Cautious Europe Cheers U.S.-Soviet Moves on Arms

NEW YORKERS Etc.
LEAD: THERE'S nothing peculiar about a person walking along a Manhattan street, or any other street for that matter, eating an ice cream cone.
It's the approach that's sometimes a little strange - ice-cream-cone-eating is not a cut-and-dried, standarized, routine matter.
It is an accomplishment with infinite variety, ranging from methodical and workmanlike procedures to methods that are visions of delicacy and grace.


New Showcases for Asian and African Art
LEAD: THE TWO NEW MUSEUMS THAT will open on the National Mall a week from tomorrow achieve an impact that far exceeds their actual size.
Their purpose seems to be to give the average viewer a sense of some of the achievements and the essential esthetic character of various Asian and African cultures.
But by delving into these cultures, the Arthur M.

MUSIC
LEAD: The week is full of desirable tickets that you probably can't get now if you haven't got them already - Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic, Domingo and Te Kanawa in ''Otello,'' and the Norman-Battle-Levine ''Ariadne,'' for instance.
Unfortunately not much else at the opera houses looks especially recommendable, with two partial exceptions: the veteran tenor Carlo Bergonzi (in ''Elisir D'Amore'' at the Metropolitan on Thursday) still had, last I heard, a melting ''una furtiva lagrima'' in him.

A Naturalists' Haven Off Canada
LEAD: ''Albatross!'' At the skipper's cry, all eyes swept to starboard of the Darwin Sound II, a 71-foot ketch chartering in the Queen Charlotte Islands off Canada's Northwest coast.

TWO VETERAN ROCK POETS WHO REFUSE TO COMPROMISE
LEAD: NO ONE WHO HAS SEEN ''THE Last Waltz,'' Martin Scorsese's film of the Band's 1976 farewell concert in San Francisco, is likely to forget the cinematic close-ups of the guest stars Van Morrison and Neil Young.
A puffy leprechaun with a wary, superstitious air, the Irish-born Mr.
Morrison had already shed the last vestiges of any youthful pop-star glamour.


URBANE RENEWAL

LINCOLN MEETS THE PRESS
LEAD: Hosannas for William Safire's brilliantly mischievous article ''Lincoln Meets the Press'' (Aug. 23).

Bottom Line

Bork finished five days of testimony before a sharply divided Senate Judiciary Committee today, vowing that if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court he will be guided not by ''some personal political agenda of my own'' or a ''desire to set a social agenda for the nation,'' but by the text of the Constitution and the intent of its framers.

LEAD: IN THE 24 YEARS SINCE THE New York Film Festival's inception, there have been films that didn't arrive on time (substitutes were offered), the seizure of a film by Customs agents before the public showing (''In the Realm of the Senses,'' 1976) and the embarrassed departure of the chief projectionist on the 1969 opening night, when the nightmare of a reel-changing snafu came true (he was persuaded to return).

LEAD: RACE has been a central issue in the Howard Beach case since its inception, but until last week it appeared that the question of racial attitudes would apply mostly to the principals in the case, four white teen-agers who are accused of being part of a mob that set upon three black men and caused the death of one of them.

Angels
LEAD: To the Editor: No discussion about fashion designers and matching investors (''In Search of the Perfect Angel,'' Aug. 30) should pass over one of the most phenomenal successes in the industry, Liz Claiborne.

A Warning
LEAD: WITH the prospect of a professional football strike on the horizon, Bowie Kuhn, the former baseball commissioner, was asked about the 1981 baseball strike and came up with what might be regarded as a cautionary tale for National Football League owners.

The Holy Landscape of Spain's Zurbaran By John Russell
LEAD: IN LAVISHING TIME, SPACE, CARE and money on the paintings of Francisco de Zurbaran (1598-1664), the Metropolitan Museum has set itself to right an ancient wrong.
Among the great Spanish painters, Zurbaran is to this day the least well known and the most difficult to study in depth.

Jazz: Larry Carlton and Yellowjackets
LEAD: WHEN jazz-fusion music was born in the late 1960's, it was a messy but adventurous blend of jazz improvisation and rock amplification, and its compositional formats suggested a sophisticated elaboration of arena rock set pieces.

The week's $16 high on the common stock, which trades over the counter, was approximately 16 times the company's net worth.


Plays Considered During a Needed Intermission
LEAD: WHILE WATCHING THE last rays of New York summer theater - ''Sherlock's Last Case,'' ''Henry IV, Part I'' and ''Bunker Reveries'' -it struck me (no revelation) that those of us who work in the critical profession spend entirely too much time viewing.
Almost every evening and on occasional matinee days, we are in the dark looking at actors trying to inject life into sometimes inert objects.

LEAD: THE wonderful world of sports has been beset for too many years by increasing displays of unsportsmanlike conduct.

Q and A
LEAD:  Sea Cloud  Question: Travel agents tell me that E. F. Hutton's private yacht, the Sea Cloud, is available only to groups, not to individuals.

Tailoring Rhetoric of Others For Candidates' New Clothes
LEAD: IF ever a campaign took inspiration from the New Testament lines, ''In the beginning was the word . . . and the word was made flesh,'' it is the campaign of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.

YONKERS MALL DRAWS AREA OPPOSITION

Nixon, and a friend of his, Charles (Bebe) Rebozo - is finally taking shape despite a continuing slump in southern Florida's residential real-estate market.


CAN THE GIANTS REPEAT AS CHAMPIONS?
LEAD: Can they repeat as champions?
They have to.
I haven't seen my father as happy as he was last year.
As a frustrated (aren't they all?) Giant fan spanning the decades, he grumbled every year during football season.
His tickets were passed on to anyone who wanted to see them then.
But last year, even being a daughter didn't help me get more than one game ticket.


Baltimore School Rule: Uniforms for Students

IT'S TIME TO RECYCLE OUR WATER
LEAD: IN Southern California is a city that shares a name with Nassau County's own Long Beach.

Returning as an Older, Angrier, Kate Jerome
LEAD: WHEN ELIZABETH FRANZ first created the part of Kate Jerome in Neil Simon's ''Brighton Beach Memoirs'' four years ago, Kate was an overburdened mother and housewife who nonetheless had a well-defined, emotionally satisfying role in life.

Film: A Horror Tale, Barker's 'Hellraiser'


ANSWERING THE MAIL
LEAD: Q. Our wood-shingle roof was sprayed with a mixture of wood preservative and linseed oil last year and some of this spray drifted onto the windows - on the glass and the metal frames.

Have you any suggestions?


Dear Mutsy, With Love From Mousie
LEAD: WHEN Carol Kulina could not find any cards that her 10-year-old daughter could send to say thank-you, the New Jersey woman started her own line.

Pop: Frankie Valli and Four Tops Share Bill
LEAD: POP music nostalgia can be a robust, openhearted celebration of younger days, but it can also be a cynical sour-spirited rehash of the past.

BASEBALL AT ITS BEST
LEAD: IN the darkness before dawn Friday, the baseball fan stirred from his pillow.


A BROKEN COUNTRY
LEAD: I OWE MY INITIATION INTO THE complexities of Indochina to Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia.

Corrections
LEAD: An article Sept. 6 on Portland, Me., incorrectly stated the time for passage between Portland and the Long Island landing.

Or perhaps they have refused to consider replacing a troublesome superintendent.


A BETTER MOUSETRAP
LEAD: What a pleasure to read Gregg Levoy's article ''A Better Mousetrap'' (About Men, Aug. 23).
I had just returned home after a day spent protesting at the National Trappers Convention, in Mansfield, Ohio, where a story such as Mr.
Levoy's would have been met with boos and beer bottles.
I had seen men who delighted in teaching young children how to trap, club and skin animals for fun and profit.

A Horror Tale, Barker's 'Hellraiser'
CLIVE BARKER, England's answer to Stephen King as a best-selling author of horror tales, branches out into film direction with ''Hellraiser,'' a gooey horror movie in which the main monster, gelatinous anyway, seems to have been dunked in simple syrup.
It oozes and drips without thought for what it does to the floors, possibly because it's supposed to be a boorish creature from the beyond.


2 Kidney Transplants Linked to AIDS Virus
LEAD: Two people became infected with the AIDS virus after receiving kidneys from an accident victim, officials said Friday, and it appears that routine pre-transplant tests for the virus were fooled because the donor's blood had been diluted by more than a dozen transfusions, officials said.

For the U.S., a Deceptive Lull In Terrorism
LEAD: ON the face of it, the wave of international terrorism that plagued the Western world throughout much of 1985 and 1986 has receded.
The American public is no longer inundated by reports of attacks in the air and at sea that came so quickly they all started to run together.
But it is wrong to conclude that terrorism has ended or even abated.

Happy Birthday to Us
LEAD: 'If our Constitution has endured, through times perilous as well as prosperour, it has not been simply as a plan of government, no matter how ingenious or inspired that might be.

THE CAREFUL SHOPPER
LEAD:  Offering Thresholds To the Past  Trips to museums or exhibits in different cities, even other countries, are planned by organizations and museums as part of their educational programs.

Opera: 'Traviata' New Cast
LEAD: AT the New York State Theater Saturday evening, Gianna Rolandi suffered the disappointment of having to withdraw from her first local appearance in ''La Traviata'' after the first act.

Stage: 'The Tightrope,' On Freedom in Spain
LEAD: TWO metaphors vie in Fernando Arrabal's ''On the Tightrope'' - death below ground and freedom in the skies.
Under the earth in the deserted mining town of Madrid, N.M., are the corpses of men and animals who perished after short lifetimes of exploitation.
The only survivor is Wichita, once a tightrope walker, still an artist and a free man.


Hutchinson Family
LEAD: More than a century ago Frederick Douglass, a former slave who was a leader in the Abolitionist movement, declared: ''I especially have a reason to feel a grateful interest in the whole Hutchinson family - for you have sung the yokes from the necks and the fetters from the limbs of my race.'' He was referring to a remarkable musical family of the 19th century.


Yankee Rookie Plays Give and Take
LEAD: In a sense, the rookie pitcher showed more poise than the veteran hitter who is tied for the major league home run lead and has driven in more runs than anyone this season.
In the end, though, it was the hitter's home run that started the pitcher on the way to his first major league loss.


Mets Falter In 14th

Another Failure to Fix the Pentagon
LEAD: Two of the Reagan Administration's highest priorities have been to force-feed the Pentagon with money, and to root out fraud, waste and abuse in the welfare system.

A Comeback for Golf
LEAD: Anyone familiar with the history of golf in China has reason to be surprised that the Chinese national golf team is on a tour of the United States.
After all, golf never gained much of a toehold in China and what little it did have was dislodged after the Communists came to power in 1949.
The few courses, which had catered primarily to the diplomatic community, were soon plowed under to make room for rice paddies.


Mexico Quake Victims Try to Forget

Matt Dillon in 'The Big Town'
IT'S the great American theme: a small-town boy seeks his fortune in the big city.
In this case he's the best crapshooter at the local garage and he heads off to ''The Big Town'' of Chicago in 1957, where he makes a pile of money and has to choose between two women: a married stripper and an unmarried mother with a heart of gold.
So it's not Horatio Alger.
More to the point, this huge cliche of a movie isn't even a distant relation of films like ''The Color of Money,'' which can actually make you root for hustlers. ''The Big Town'' only proves we've gone back to the 1950's one time too many.


About Real Estate; Renovators in Greenpoint Tackle New Construction

Want to Play Golf in Japan? Got a Million?
LEAD: Earlier this year, an avid golfer here reportedly offered $3.57 million to buy a membership at the exclusive Koganei Country Club.
But, as a sign of the fanatical attachment of the Japanese to the game, no Koganei member was willing, even for that unprecedented sum, to sell.


Phone Work May Be Split
LEAD: The General Services Administration, bowing to increasing Congressional pressure, is expected to announce soon that it plans to divide a multibillion-dollar contract to replace the Federal Government's telephone system, sources close to the agency say.

LEAD: A 34-year-old woman was shot and killed on Pitkin Avenue in the East New York section of Brooklyn last night, only a few blocks from where a transit police officer was fatally wounded in a shootout with two gunmen Tuesday night.


Concert: Vienna Orchestra
LEAD: THERE are not many composers around these days who can persuade the world's brand-name orchestras to play their works.
Leonard Bernstein is among the fortunate few, a circumstance traceable to some extent to the fact that he is not only a writer of music but also one of the world's brand-name conductors.


WAR ON DRUGS PUTS STRAIN ON PRISONS, U.S. OFFICIALS SAY
LEAD: The national effort against the illegal use of drugs has sent a new wave of offenders into the Federal prisons, overwhelming facilities that are already crowded, Justice Department officials say.

Opera: 'Ariadne' at the Met
LEAD: THE Metropolitan Opera's new season, off to a desultory beginning with ''Otello'' and ''Manon,'' gave signs of flickering into life on Wednesday evening with the return of ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' to the repertory.
It was an uneven and sometimes puzzling night vocally, but at its best the performance of Richard Strauss's elegant comedy radiated quality as well as the promise of finer things in later presentations.


C. Parkinson Now Grateful To Fill Time
LEAD: It has been 30 years since Parkinson's Law entered the language neat as Halley's Comet, and now Cyril Northcote Parkinson, the lawmaker, is slower of step as he tries to retire from all work, which, he memorably postulated, ''expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.''


100 Percent Deceptive
LEAD: The word ''percent'' is not hard to grasp.
The definition is in the word: in or for a hundred.
If the interest on your $200 loan is 10 percent, you owe ten dollars for every hundred borrowed, or $20.
Candidates in the 1986 Congressional races spent $400 million, 24.3 percent of it on television and radio, according to the National Association of Broadcasters; air time thus cost nearly $97 million.


Ryder Cup Stakes Are Higher
LEAD: In a way, the defeat of the United States team of professional golfers by their European opponents in 1985, after decades of American dominance in Ryder Cup play, was comparable to the loss of the America's Cup to Australia in 1983.
As in the yachting competition, the return match, which begins here

CHEZ NAPOLEON, #365 West 50th Street (265-6980) - *(Nov. 18, 1983) Just west of Eighth Avenue is this French bistro in two tiny pleasantly seedy dining rooms with a kitchen that offers some enjoyable bourgeois cooking.


MONASTIC MASTERPIECES FROM ZURBARAN AT MET
LEAD: THE Francisco de Zurbaran retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is something of an event.
It is the first exhibition in the United States that has attempted to reconstruct the career of a 17th-century Spanish master who is widely known in bits and pieces.
But what impact those bits and pieces have had!

LEAD: ''THE DREYFUS AFFAIR:


THE EVENING HOURS
LEAD: JOHN L. TISHMAN, the chief executive officer of Tishman Realty and Construction, thinks parties should be fun, even benefit parties.
So when he was asked to be the chairman of a fund-raiser for the Carnegie Hall Society, he decided that people who were paying $1,000 or more for a ticket should be entertained.

Film: 'Princess Bride,' Full-Length Fairy Tale
LEAD: ''THE PRINCESS BRIDE'' is framed as a story told to a sick little boy, and the child is thoroughly skeptical -who wouldn't be?
Here is a full-length fairy tale full of fanciful characters, madcap adventures and a lot of other things surely not to every taste.
But ''The Princess Bride'' has sweetness and sincerity on its side, and when it comes to fairy tales, those are major assets.


DeCinces Released
LEAD: The California Angels released Doug DeCinces, their 37-year-old third baseman, yesterday and by so doing averted a buyout clause in DeCinces' contract that would have cost the Angels $141,667 next year.
If the third baseman had completed this season with California, the Angels could have exercised their contractual option for his services in 1988 at a salary of $850,000, or used the buyout clause.


Deficit Cuts: Less of a Bite

'Dark Eyes,' Comedy Based on Chekhov Tales
NIKITA MIKHALKOV'S ''Dark Eyes,'' tonight's convivial opening attraction of the 25th New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center, is both enchanting and enchanted, a triumph composed of seemingly irreconcilable contradictions.
''Dark Eyes'' is - technically - a pastiche, but it has the manner of something freshly conceived.
It's Russian to the core, yet much of it is set in Italy and its star is the matchless Marcello Mastroianni.
It's a wise, ruefully funny Chekhovian comedy, though Chekhov did not write it.
It takes one into a turn-of-the-century world that's as casually prescient as those of ''The Three Sisters'' and ''Uncle Vanya,'' without for a minute seeming to be.

Krukow's Bat, Arm Move Giants Closer
LEAD: Mike Krukow, a Giants pitcher, snapped a sixth-inning tie tonight with a run-scoring single, and San Francisco went on to beat the Atlanta Braves, 9-2.
Any combination of San Francisco victories or Cincinnati defeats totaling three will give the Giants their first National League West title since 1971.


GOING OUT OF BUSINESS: CLIENTS COME LAST
LEAD: Gym bag slung on his shoulder, Ken Feinberg arrived at the Parc Swim and Health Club on West 56th Street last Saturday afternoon, same as always, to work out.

LEAD: A series of earthquakes rocked central Tibet early today, but casualties and damages were unknown, the official New China News Agency reported.

The first measured 5.3 on the Richter scale and the other two measured 4.5.


THE LAST REFUGE OF SMOKERS MAY BE NO PLACE BUT HOME
LEAD: SMOKERS lost another battle last week, although it could have been worse.
The board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, while agreeing not to ban smoking on Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road commuter trains, voted to reduce significantly the number of smoking cars.


THE WORKPLACE IS SET TO GET YOUNGER
LEAD: WITH the help of posters, fliers tucked in grocery bags and even school visits, retailers are already aggressively recruiting the youngest and newest members of the labor pool, 15-year-olds, to take their places behind cash registers and store counters as soon as a new law that allows them to work takes effect on


CHOOSING A THERAPIST
LEAD: Morton Hunt's article ''Navigating the Therapy Maze'' (Aug. 30) was the most thorough, objective and intelligent piece I have read on the complex business of psychotherapy.


Question Of the Week; Will the New N.H.L. Rules Curb Brawling?
LEAD: Bench-clearing brawls haven't been a major problem during the past few N.H.L. seasons.
In fact, there were more brawls in baseball this season than in the N.H.L.
However, a team like the Philadelphia Flyers can still afford to lose Craig Berube for 10 games and Dave Brown for 5 -if those two players are the first off a bench during a brawl - and still finish in first place by 20 points.


GHOST SHIPS ON THE HUDSON
LEAD: WORLD'S END  By T. Coraghessan Boyle. 456 pp. New York: Viking. $19.95.


Women's Fair Compensates For Loss of Vermont E.R.A.

PENTAGON PROCUREMENT HAS ARMOR THAT REPELS REFORM

Peter Tosh, Reggae's Rebel
LEAD: ON SEPT. 11, PETER TOSH was senselessly murdered at his home in Kingston, Jamaica, at the age of 42.
Since Bob Marley had died of a brain tumor six years earlier, two of the three founding members of the Wailers, the Beatles of reggae, are no more.
Now it's up to Bunny Wailer to carry on an extraordinary tradition.


Question Of the Week; Will the New N.H.L. Rules Curb Brawling?
LEAD: One night the TV sportscaster tells me the N.H.L. has passed new anti-brawling measures.
The next night I see fights in the highlights of the Rangers-United States Olympic Team exhibition.
Some things never change.
The N.H.L. continues to mold its game to attract the demented fight fans while driving the hockey purist away.

Illustrated. 383 pp.
Cambridge, Mass.: The MIT Press. $50.


Film Festival; 'Month in the Country,' From Director of 'Cal'
LEAD: PAT O'CONNOR'S direction broadens and illuminates ''A Month in the Country'' even as the writing - a screenplay by Simon Gray, from the novel by J.L.
Carr - strives to tie up any loose ends.
Indeed, Mr.
O'Connor, whose first feature was the haunting ''Cal,'' does a great deal to keep an eloquent but small film from seeming even smaller.


A HALF-LOAF OF VINDICATION
LEAD: REPRESENTATIVE Mario Biaggi of the Bronx was back in his Washington office Wednesday, dapper as usual in a gray sharkskin suit and surrounded by the mementos of 19 years on Capitol Hill.
But after his conviction in Brooklyn Tuesday with Meade H. Esposito, the former Brooklyn Democratic leader, on Federal charges involving unlawful gratuities, nothing could be the same.


'Three Continents,' Four Worlds

A DAUGHTER'S VISIT: THE PAIN OF LETTING GO
LEAD: JAN is coming for a visit.
I haven't seen her for more than a year.
Once she was a part of me, no separation.
Now I settle for a week or 10 days.
When Jan was a little girl, she clung to me.
I urged her to become independent.
One summer, when she was 4, she refused to attend summer camp with the other neighborhood children.


LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
LEAD: Tie Me Vanderbilt Down The stars may soon be inside and outside the Vanderbilt Museum in Centerport.
While the planetarium continues its heavenly shows, the mansion may soon be host to its own set of stars: the cast of ''Crocodile Dundee II.''


MATTHEW MODINE PLOTS THE COURSE TO CHARACTER
LEAD: MATTHEW MODINE CAN walk New York streets and blend into the crowd, thanks to an odd coincidence: in his most-admired screen roles he has a shaved head. ''People don't recognize me,'' he says, just half a block from a theater where he is starring in Stanley Kubrick's ''Full Metal Jacket.'' Only later, when Mr.


Bush Meets With Polish Leaders
LEAD: Vice President Bush and Gen.

LEAD:  Hockey  Rangers Top Whalers: Brian Mullen scored twice, Tomas Sandstrom collected a goal and two assists and Steve Nemeth added three assists to spark New York's 5-3 exhibition victory over the Whalers last night in Hartford.

LEAD: The Reagan Administration wants to curtail face-to-face hearings for people who contend they have been improperly denied benefits under Medicare.


A New Incentive For Restoration
LEAD: THE nation seems in a mood to celebrate its history, and landscape architects are no different; they are increasingly perceiving historic gardens as being worthy of restoration.
There is even a renewal of the familiar ethic that planting is ''good for the soul.''


Correction
LEAD: An obituary of Dr.
George R. Meneely last Sunday misidentified the medical school with which he was associated.
He was a founder of the Louisiana State University Medical Center at Shreveport and headed the physiology and biophysics department on that campus.


Horszowski's Quiet, Elegant Pianism
LEAD: ALL THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO wait, and few have been more patient than Mieczyslaw Horszowski.
Through his first half-century of concertizing - Mr.
Horszowski made his debut in Vienna in 1902 - prevailing tastes favored flashier, more virtuosic performers, and he settled into a career just beyond the spotlight.


MOMENTARY UPSETS AND GOOD MARRIAGES
LEAD: I HAVE been studying the generation gap recently.
My children have a way of catching each other's eye and then looking at me and laughing quietly when I think I am behaving absolutely normally.
Their father bursts into song, and again I see them eye each other knowingly.
Often our behavior seems oddly quaint to them, and they tease us about it by threatening to engrave on our tombstones our simplistic cures for everything They love us, but they are making their lists, which are titled, ''What I won't do when I am a parent,'' and ''Things the man (or woman) I will marry will NEVER do!


A Hunter Who Stalked His Prey With a Camera
LEAD: HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON, known as the master of modern photography, has moved from painting to photography, and back again, in his long, incredibly active life.
The black-and-white photographs he made in the 1930's are on view in a show that opened recently at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, while his little-known drawings and temperas are being shown in a current exhibition at the Arnold Herstand Gallery (24 West 57th Street).


New Burundi Leader Vows to Lift Curbs on Church
LEAD: Pope John Paul II sent a letter to Burundi's Roman Catholic bishops last year to protest what he viewed as Government persecution of the church.

Jean Ndikuriyo read the letter to his students, urged them to work for peace and was later arrested.


PERSONAL RIGHTS AND GROUP HOMES
LEAD: May I request a correction concerning a misquote attributed to me in ''Roslyn Resists a Group Home''  [ Aug. 23 ] .
Not only did I not say ''she feared for her property values'' but in an earlier interview I said that although one's property value was not directly involved, there was general cause for concern in the implementation of the Mental Health Law as it applies to deinstitutionalization.


Sales Force
LEAD: To the Editor:


A New Corporate Hero - the Operateur
LEAD: RECENTLY I was reading one of those magazine articles that profile the 500 bosses of the biggest companies in America.
These profiles were dominated by the triumphs and travails of these chief executive officers on the dealmaking front.
Either they were annexing huge new conquests - like Roger Smith of General Motors, Jack Welch of General Electric and Ross Johnson of RJR Nabisco - or they were undoing a predecessor's annexations, like Robert Daniell of United Technologies and Martin Davis of Gulf &amp; Western.


REBEL WITH A CAUSE
LEAD: EVERYWHERE HE LOOKS, HE SEES THE high and haughty giving short shrift to the humble American, and John Cougar Mellencamp is in a slow burn.

Accountants Try to Put a Little Kick in Their Image
LEAD: LIKE many of his number-crunching brethren, Robert Mead of Louisville, Ky., was proud to be an accountant.
Very proud.
In fact, as one of eight candidates running for state treasurer in the Democratic primary this May, he wanted every voter to know he was a C.P.A.
Unfortunately for him, all references to professional pedigrees are forbidden on the Kentucky ballot.

Ballistics Tests Set in Slaying of 6
LEAD: Residents here and the authorities were mystified today after a hard-working 14-year-old boy apparently killed six members of his family before he died in a struggle with his uncle.
The uncle was wounded.


Easing of Soviet Policy on South Africa Is Seen
LEAD: The Soviet reluctance to have South Africa expelled from the International Atomic Energy Agency could signal a wider Soviet desire to ''open channels of communication with Pretoria,'' in the view of a South African analyst of Soviet affairs.

LEAD: The Iranian sailors captured after their mine-laying ship was attacked by American helicopters in the Persian Gulf were sent back home today amid reports that some of them had requested political asylum.


THE WORM AND THE APPLE: Dirt and Delay; The Brooklyn-Queens Crawl
LEAD: Progress on rebuilding a decayed 1.7-mile stretch of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway continues slowly while costs rise quickly and driver tolerance disappears.


California Sheer
LEAD: SHEER is clearly a trend in California fashion.
In the spring collections shown in Los Angeles last week, designers used fabrics like net and chiffon in a multitude of ways, mostly seductive and sensuous.
Jessica McClintock, for example, layered lacy skirts over tights (left) and offered blouses with lacy rear panels that left hints of skin without being the least sinful.

CUBA, 20 YEARS LATER
LEAD: I was alarmed to learn that, during the critical days of the Cuban missile crisis, Robert S. McNamara, the Secretary of Defense, was not informed that the ''red alert'' message transmitted to our Strategic Air Command units was sent out uncoded, ''just so the Soviets could pick it up.''


SUSAN JENNETT, AN EDITOR, WEDS JAMES F. BLEECKER

It is Calton Homes Inc.


LEGAL DUMPING STILL THE BIG FACTOR
LEAD: ALTHOUGH illegal dumping at sea wrought noticeable environmental damage along the New Jersey coast this summer, such dumping was minor when compared with legal ocean dumping.


CUBA, 20 YEARS LATER
LEAD: Robert McNamara's contention that the Cuban missile placement was not a major military move beggars the imagination.


MISS BROWN, AN EDITOR, IS WED TO JEFFREY SEELY
LEAD: At the Congregational Church in Killingworth, Conn., Kimberly A. Brown, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Bartlett K. Brown of Laguna Beach, Calif., and Jeffrey Thomas Seely, the son of Mr. and Mrs.

Keep Talking With Canada on Trade
LEAD: Last week, the talks on a free-trade pact between the United States and Canada broke down and the Canadian delegation was called home.


PLUGGING THE HOLES IN WALL AND WALLET
LEAD: TAKEN together, the cracks in an average home amount to a sizable area of heat loss, by some estimates as much as four square feet.
That's like leaving a bedroom window wide open all year round.
However, by using caulking compound, you can fill those cracks easily and seal a significant leak in your energy-bill budget as well.


Regal Buick at Last
LEAD: WE were juniors in high school, and Miss Steinmuller thought it would do us good to stand up in front of the class and debate.
Kids talking about social issues, things of importance.


A Quest to Do Something 'Important'
LEAD: AS a rule, Arthur L. Carter - who studied the piano, worked as an investment banker, owned sheet-metal companies, started a weekly suburban newspaper, bought The Nation magazine and is now unveiling New York's newest newspaper - has always had a problem knowing what he wanted to do.

Hermann Casper Schwab of Oyster Bay, L.I.
The Rev.
Iris Slocombe performed the ceremony at the Eastern Shore Episcopal Chapel.


Rail Passes
LEAD: To the Editor: In the article about Swiss lake travel (Travel, Aug. 23), the usual statement is made that Swiss Holiday Passes must be purchased abroad.
This is simply not true.
This summer I purchased mine in a small Swiss railway station that does not ordinarily carry it - they simply phoned to Lucerne, and in the afternoon it was delivered.


MISS HIGGINS HAS WEDDING
LEAD: At St.
Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Greenwich, Conn., Barbara Olin Higgins, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

The Key To The Heart Of Sardinia
LEAD: The Mediterranean sun is high and hot now, and most of the Italian families spending Sunday at the beach have moved back under the pines with their picnic baskets.
Behind the pines is a cluster of beach houses, their whitewashed faces and terra cotta roofs shimmering in the heat, and it is here that the Sbignesi clan is gathering for the ritual Sunday lunch.


JOY TOMLINSON IS MARRIED IN MICHIGAN
LEAD: Joy Ann Tomlinson, the daughter of James Patrick Tomlinson of Birmingham, Mich., and the late Joy Benesh Tomlinson, was married yesterday to Charles Aycock McLendon Jr., the son of Mr. and Mrs.
McLendon of Greensboro, N.C.
The Rev.
Dr.
James Anderson, a Presbyterian minister, performed the ceremony at the Kirk in the Hills in Bloomfield Hills,


Economist to Economist, in English
LEAD: ECONOMISTS differ on the extent to which their profession has beat a general retreat from thinking about policy.
But few disagree that there has been a retreat from policy pronouncements, and, in a decade that has seen the worst recession since the Great Depression, a shrinking market for them.


FORECASTS SHOULD STICK TO FACTS
LEAD: WEATHER GIRLS, with their terrific hairstyles and fixed smiles, who could all write backward on plexiglass, are I guess gone forever.
And I'm not too happy with what has taken their place.


PEACE IS STILL A LONG SHOT IN EL SALVADOR
LEAD: OF all the developments in El Salvador since the signing of the Central American peace accord Aug. 7, few have been more striking than this month's announcement by Ruben Zamora that he intends to end seven years of exile and become the first top leftist leader to return to the country since the civil war began in 1979.


When the Password is a Passkey
LEAD: THE password for today is ''computer security.'' Members of a West German computer club disclosed earlier this month that they had successfully thwarted the security systems of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's computer network in Europe.
For three months this summer the young computer enthusiasts, or hackers, had virtually unrestricted access to the agency's scientific data.


University's Shift on South Africa Is Protested
LEAD: A decision by the University of Rochester to begin investing in companies that do business in South Africa has created a furor in the first weeks of the new semester.


THE WORM AND THE APPLE: Dirt and Delay; Environment for Trouble
LEAD: New York City's Environmental Control Board collects fines on the half-million tickets issued each year by other city departments for quality-of-life offenses.
They cover a range - air and noise pollution, littering, ignoring the pooper-scooper law.
Since 1979, audits and investigations have exposed problems of management at the agency, and a disturbing study just released confirms them once again.


WITH THE NEW CROP IN, APPLES SHINE
LEAD: AS summer segues into fall and rich, soft fruits like peaches, nectarines and plums fade from the season, the crisp new apple crop is welcome.
And these days there are more varieties than ever under cultivation and for sale in stores and at fruit stands.


France
LEAD: To the Editor: I am sorry that Hugh Nissenson either did not know or did not have space to describe, in his article on Pontlevoy (''Portrait of a Loire Village, Travel, June 14) the chamber music experience that occurs for two weeks in August and which my wife and I found so satisfying.
At that time Americans and other foreign amateur musicians (and spouses) come and live at the abbey and study and play in Montrichard with 150 French students.

WITH THE NEW CROP IN, APPLES SHINE
LEAD: AS summer segues into fall and rich, soft fruits like peaches, nectarines and plums fade from the season, the crisp new apple crop is welcome.
And these days there are more varieties than ever under cultivation and for sale in stores and at fruit stands.


Healthy, Stealthy, And Wise
LEAD: You're a nut who loves driving fast.
Your ''fuzz buster'' warns that your speeding vehicle is being tracked by a state trooper's radar.
What to do?


PLUGGING THE HOLES IN WALL AND WALLET
LEAD: TAKEN together, the cracks in an average home amount to a sizable area of heat loss, by some estimates as much as four square feet.
That's like leaving a bedroom window wide open all year round.
However, by using caulking compound, you can fill those cracks easily and seal a significant leak in your energy-bill budget as well.


Notre Dame Surges to Go 3-0
LEAD: Anthony Johnson rushed for three touchdowns as Notre Dame rallied from a 17-10 deficit today to defeat Purdue, 44-20.


Union Opens on Its Usual Winning Note
LEAD: Since Lou Rettino took over as the head coach at Union High School 11 years ago, other coaches have been measuring their squads by the Union standard.
With a 31-0 drubbing of hapless Irvington High School in its season opener today, Union was well on its way toward being a symbol of excellence in New Jersey again this year.


Pro Football; Jets' Theme: 'Jump Right In'
LEAD: ''Where do I go?'' the new player wearing uniform No. 97 asked Joe Walton.


Abba Kovner, Israeli Poet, Dies

He was 69 years old.


Tokyo Tacos: The Japanese Look to West
LEAD: Japan's knowledge of the West has come a long way since one of its first visitors to the United States reported in 1860 that all single American women were called Joan, ''while married ladies are distinguished by the suffix 'sons,' such as 'Joansons.' ''


WHAT'S DOING IN CHICAGO
LEAD: Chicago is no longer America's second city, a distinction lost several years ago to Los Angeles and its pastel sprawl.
But it endures, as perhaps no other place, as the archetype of the great American metropolis, a loud, brawling, robust city where the local politics, like the architecture, seems to exist on a scale much larger than life.


NAOMI IRELAND RUSH WEDS ERIC OLSON
LEAD: The marriage of Naomi Ireland Rush and Eric John Olson took place yesterday at the home of the bride's parents, Dr. and Mrs.

A Happy Surprise For Yanks
LEAD: Had there been healthier arms to choose from, Pete Filson would almost surely have spent the night watching from the bullpen.
But the Yankees' need for pitching help is great these days -Rick Rhoden is out for the season, Ron Guidry will not start again - so Filson stepped into the void tonight at Memorial

LEAD:  A LIFE IN PEACE AND WAR  By Brian Urquhart.
Illustrated. 390 pp.
New York: Harper &amp; Row. $25.


How to Think Absolutely Positively
LEAD: IN RESPONSE TO A READER WHO AC-cuses all critics of accentuating the negative, I hurry to state that I agree wholeheartedly.
It is deplorably true that most of us fail to heed the ancient maternal advice: if you can't say anything nice about somebody, don't say anything.
It is no excuse to pretend that if we adhered to this gentle injunction there occasionally would be blank columns where the criticism would have run.


H. C. SCULLY WEDS LOUISE W. O'BRIEN
LEAD: The marriage of Louise Walker O'Brien, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Frank O'Brien Jr. of Boston and Edgartown, Mass., to Henry Crocker Scully, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

Serious and Shocking
LEAD: To the Editor:


PLUGGING THE HOLES IN WALL AND WALLET
LEAD: TAKEN together, the cracks in an average home amount to a sizable area of heat loss, by some estimates as much as four square feet.
That's like leaving a bedroom window wide open all year round.
However, by using caulking compound, you can fill those cracks easily and seal a significant leak in your energy-bill budget as well.

LEAD:  To the Editor:


Worthless Assets
LEAD: To the Editor:


SAILING INTO PORT
LEAD: WHILE ROVING THROUGH Portugal in 1678 looking for wines suitable for the British market, two young Englishmen stopped for dinner at a monastery in Lamego, near the River Douro.
Unlike most local wines, the vintage served by the abbot was smooth, sweet and suprisingly palatable.
After persuading his guests to buy a goodly quantity, so the story goes, the abbot confided that he had added several liters of brandy to the wine while it was fermenting.

BAGELS GIVE TOWN AN ECONOMIC BOOST
LEAD: IT took a bagel baker to make people in the small town of Putnam realize they have finally joined the economic boom that has been benefiting so many Connecticut communities.


CUBA, 20 YEARS LATER
LEAD: From a long-range historical viewpoint, the participants at the ''Class Reunion'' appear to have missed the lasting impact of the Cuban missile crisis.
For the first time, the United States was bound not to militarily intervene in the affairs of a country in the Western Hemisphere.
Considering United States military participation in Cuba on four previous occasions, this was a result of great significance.

IN ERITREA
LEAD: ON THE WALL OF EVERY mud-brick clinic in Eritrea I saw the same poster.
It shows two children, one suffering from starvation, the other from the protein-deficiency syndrome called kwashiorkor, which creates the characteristic pot-bellied look of the victim of famine.
The writing on this ubiquitous poster was usually in Tigrinya or Tigre, the major languages of Eritrea, a land situated along the Red Sea coast of what is now Ethiopia.


A. G. FOSTER WEDS PAMELA T. BRUNET

Question Of the Week; Will the New N.H.L. Rules Curb Brawling?
LEAD: Of course not . . . no more than a no-swearing rule would curb guttermouths.
Americans love violence, always have and always will.
During a brawl, look at the faces and antics of the fans.
They're getting what they paid for.


A Deep Division In Labor Dispute
LEAD: Unlike in 1982, when the major contentious issue was money, the current National Football League players' strike is being fueled by a clash in ideologies.

Quotation of the Day
LEAD: ''Resegregation of schools is the great issue of the next generation.
Little Rock is an example of what is happening all over, but it's not an extreme example.

LEAD: IF there is something to celebrate during the next nine months or so, you can bet that Connecticut theaters are going to find it, be it the centennial of a titanic playwright's birth, the 350th birthday of a city or, on a less grandiose scale, a theater's own silver anniversary.


VILLIANS AND HEROES
LEAD:  To the Editor:


SCEINCE WRITING: TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE?
LEAD: IN an age when ''scientific prose'' is a virtual synonym for ''literary Novocain,'' it seems hard to believe that American scientific journals once contained some of the most exciting writing of their era.
Two hundred years ago, American scientists publishing their research offered not only sound empirical data but small jokes and vast vistas, the fear of God and the hope of an American paradise.


For the Piano, Chords of Change
LEAD: IN A SMALL MINI-MALL, NOT far from the Las Vegas strip, stands Nevada's third most popular tourist attraction (after gambling and the Hoover Dam) - the Liberace Museum.
It houses all the outfits, rhinestones and glitz one might expect, including a painting of the late pianist's mother, opulent gifts from royalty and an extravagantly decorated Rolls-Royce.


PLUGGING THE HOLES IN WALL AND WALLET
LEAD: TAKEN together, the cracks in an average home amount to a sizable area of heat loss, by some estimates as much as four square feet.
That's like leaving a bedroom window wide open all year round.
However, by using caulking compound, you can fill those cracks easily and seal a significant leak in your energy-bill budget as well.


The Illustrious Lunchers At the Algonquin Recalled
LEAD: FROM IDEA TO EXECUTION, it took almost as long to produce as its lively title -''The Ten-Year Lunch'' - suggests.

Question Of the Week; Will the New N.H.L. Rules Curb Brawling?
LEAD: I've been watching N.H.L. hockey since 1960 and bench-clearing brawling, the specific target of this new legislation, is the rare exception.
In a sport that encourages clutch-and-grab defense, the great equalizer between the Gretzkys and the spear-carriers; in a league woefully watered down by overexpansion, fighting will unfortunately continue to be one of its major selling points, a fact cosmetic rule changes cannot hide.

Dance: 2 French Works At Montreal Festival

IN NFL STRIKE, IT'S THE PRINCIPLE AND THE MONEY
LEAD: FREE AGENT.
The words evoke images of someone without restrictions or allegiance, someone free to come or go or stay.

Question Of the Week; Will the New N.H.L. Rules Curb Brawling?
LEAD: Though the new N.H.L. rules might curb the bench-clearing brawl, they do little to remedy the cause of these brawls: vicious slashing, high-sticking and elbowing.
The current system of suspensions is inadequate.
Make the suspended player's team play with a shortened roster.
When teams begin having to compete with 15 skaters, thereby fatiguing their best players, they might think twice before hiring an enforcer.


NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD:  'A Book Must Be an Ice-Axe'  What should a book be or do?

Shevardnadze Off to Rio to Start Latin Tour
LEAD: Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze arrived here today on a regional tour intended to expand the Soviet Union's presence in Latin America.


Should Ballet Be A Competitive Event?
LEAD: THE NEWEST GROWTH INDUS-try in the arts, if 1988 is a portent, appears to be the international ballet competition.
This increase in number and the fact that the value of the competitions is arguable evoke mixed feelings: ballet is incontrovertibly a matter of esthetics, not meant to be treated as competitive sport.


Foliage and Robert Frost for Russians in Vermont
LEAD: In 1984, when a delegation of Soviet journalists were considering possible locations for a meeting in New England, Aleksei Burmistenko proposed Vermont.

Music
LEAD: Diverse concerts of ''crossover'' music -not the pseudo-jazz, pseudo-classical new-age variety but forms of more substance and interest - are being offered around the city this week.
The languages of serious music and jazz have both been enriched by borrowing ideas one from the other; composers for opera and commercial theater have looked profitably throughout this century at each other's work, and musicians from East and


Home Remedies
LEAD: WHEN BEN OLEWINE DECIDED to build a house in Fairfield County, Conn., he wanted to avoid using a material that, in his New York City apartment, had literally made him sick. ''My eyes were constantly irritated and I kept sneezing, getting congested and feeling nauseous,'' recalls Mr.

W.
Bradford Greeley performed the ceremony at the Main Line Unitarian Church in Devon, Pa.


America's Army of Non-Workers
LEAD: BY all the rules of economics, Donna Van Name should be back in the work force.

Keeping Low Profile, Ethics Panel Chief Aims for Thoroughness
LEAD: When Governor Cuomo last spring introduced John D. Feerick as the new chairman of his Commission on Government Integrity, it was clear that he had not exactly heeded suggestions that he find someone with the same name recognition and headline-generating capacity as his original choice, Joseph A. Califano Jr.


CRIME
LEAD: It's long, it's ambitious and it grabs you from the beginning.
QUEST by Richard Ben Sapir (Dutton, $18.95) is exactly that.
It is the tale of a quest -the search for an object part of whose story can be traced back to prehistory.
It is a quest in which two major knights participate: one a Galahad type, the other a flawed aristocrat close to Milton's Satan.


THEATRICAL WINS TURF CLASSIC
LEAD: The showdown between Manila and Thetrical in the Arlington Million three weeks ago fizzled when Manila scored an easy victory and Theatrical ran a dull third.
Manila was injured and retired last week, and now Theatrical's handlers can only wonder what might have happened had Theatrical run as well against


Driver Is Conscious
LEAD: AFTER being unconscious for more than two weeks with a head injury suffered in a crash during a test run, Roberto Guerrero, a 28-year-old race-car driver from Colombia, has regained consciousness.
John White, a spokesman for Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, said yesterday that Guerrero was still mildly disoriented.


STAMFORD UPBEAT ON SHUTTLE BUS
LEAD: THE roar of downshifting trucks overhead on Interstate 95 in Stamford did not hinder the Dixieland band's rendition of ''Sweet Georgia Brown'' under the overpass.
Green-and-white balloons tied to a fence bobbed in the morning breeze.
Then, a drumroll.
Rome Holley of Norwalk gripped the steering wheel, shifted into drive, and drove the new Downtown Shuttle through a red ribbon tied between two traffic signs on the north side of the Stamford Transportation

Verbatim: Waiting for Parity
LEAD: 'In the American educational system, some students have had, metaphorically speaking, the advantage of great training from the day they were born, while others are thrown belatedly into the game without a glove.

Goodbye, Old Paint
LEAD: THERE'S A STORY ABOUT A workman just beginning a tour of duty high on the George Washington Bridge.

Learning to Love Gym
LEAD: KIDS LOVE TO PLAY.
BY extension, gym class should be the most anticipated part of the school day - a time for high-energy activity and physical release.
Yet, all too often, gym has been the class kids love to hate.
It takes little prompting for many adults to recall the humiliation of being the last one picked for the team or the ignominy of doing calisthenics under the watchful eye of a drill sergeant.


Taming the Wild Mushroom
LEAD: HUNTING AND EATING wild mushrooms is an ancient tradition in Europe and Asia, where dozens of varieties have been sold in markets for centuries and most consumers know precisely what they are buying.

Cold Relievers
LEAD: THE SEASON OF THE RHI-novirus is upon us, and if you aren't already watery eyed and miserable, statistics say you will be within the next few weeks.

Katharine Hepburn Takes the Movies' Measure
LEAD: EVER SINCE KATHARINE Hepburn won the first of her four Academy Awards, for playing the role of a stage-struck tomboy in ''Morning Glory'' in 1933, she has wooed audiences with her unique blend of sass and class.
Unlike many other actresses who have faded from view, she has taken on some of her most memorable and significant roles late in life - she won three Oscars after she turned 58, for her performances in ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' ''The Lion in Winter'' and ''On Golden Pond.

AIDS, Rights and the Federal Role
LEAD: DR.
C.
EVERETT KOOP, the Surgeon General of the United States, said recently that the purely scientific problems posed by the AIDS epidemic were probably less difficult than the social and ethical questions.

IMPRESSIONS OF OLD RUSSIA FROM A BALLET STUDENT OF 'MADAME'
LEAD: TO reach the house we had to walk from the street down a long walkway that was completely encased in a forest of tall bamboo; creaking and hissing as we passed, it kept us in deep shade right up to the front door.
Turning the polished brass knob carefully and quietly -the door was never locked - we tiptoed into the small foyer, closing the door as silently as possible behind us.


GIVE PARAMEDICS DUE RECOGNITION
LEAD: In David M. Halbfinger's article  [ 'Penn Station: Tale of Tired and Troubled,' Aug. 30 ] , the caption under one of the pictures is incorrect and misleading.

LEAD: WITH all the available formats, buying a camcorder can be confusing.

'AMERICAN WOMEN ARTISTS' IN HARTFORD

THE BEST BUYER FOR YOUR HOME

IN DOCTOR'S OFFICE, ON TRIAL FOR AIDS
LEAD: IT was a state-of-the-art obstetrical-gynecological office in an affluent North Shore community, a 45-minute drive from my home.
The medical complex sat across from the hospital where I would deliver my third child.
This clinic, as my mother noted with pleasure while I parked my car, was a far cry from the street-wise Bronx community clinic


Correction

One important criterion is to choose a therapist who has undergone a complete personal analysis (three or more sessions a week).


Question Of the Week; Will the New N.H.L. Rules Curb Brawling?
LEAD: The cynical view is that the rules will have some modest impact on the bench-clearing brawl, which delays the game, but will not really deal with the constant fighting that characterizes the sport.
And until the owners believe that the public is fed up with the fighting, it will continue to be a part of professional hockey.

Therefore, I would not recommend taking it as gifts for children.


Distorting Corporate Investment
LEAD: ONE of the most frequently heard arguments supporting hostile takeovers is that they promote competitiveness among corporate managers.
Competition occurs on many levels, however, and takeovers can hurt competition on what may be the most important level in the long run, the real product market.


APPLE GROWERS SEE SMALLER HARVEST
LEAD: CONNECTICUT apples now look bright and rosy at roadside stands, but this harvest season does not look so bright to many of the state's approximately 100 apple growers.
A spring frost, a summer drought and perhaps pesky mites have troubled this year's crop.


How to Avoid Losing Luggage
LEAD: Before you tell me where your luggage went over your vacation, let me tell you.
Our big bag took a lovely two-day trip to San Diego.

IN MEXICO, INTELLECTUALS DEFY THE STATE - BUT GET INVITED TO LUNCH
LEAD: THE governing elite's traditional attitude toward Mexico's intelligentsia was probably best expressed by Porfirio Diaz, who ruled the country with an iron hand from 1876 to 1910.

Philharmonic: Sir Colin Davis Conducts
LEAD: THE Sixth Symphony of Ralph Vaughan Williams is a big, sinewy piece, sometimes harsh, sometimes - especially in the jazz-tinted parts near the start - rollicking in a rough way.
