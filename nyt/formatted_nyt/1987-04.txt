Nuclear Unit to Cut Pacific Gas Net
LEAD: The Pacific Gas and Electric Company said it expected its 1987 earnings to be reduced by about $470 million, or $1.25 a share, because of a change in accounting procedures related to the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant.
The reduction is equivalent to almost half of the company's net income.
But the company said the accounting change would not affect its cash position and that its annual dividend would remain at $1.92.


Comings and Goings
LEAD: A new two-year contract proposal that would pay Roger Clemens a $1.5 million base salary in 1988 was rejected yesterday by the Boston Red Sox.

The loss appears to be the largest annual loss ever reported by a Canadian business.


KNICKS PUT END TO LOSS STREAK
LEAD: With seven seconds remaining, Chris McNealy replaced Louis Orr.
There was no particular game strategy involved in Bob Hill's move.
The Knick coach was simply looking for an ovation for Orr, the 6-foot-9-inch forward who had 28 points last night - equaling his career high - in the Knicks' surprising 128-120 victory over the Boston Celtics at Madison Square


KHAKI ATTIRE GOES TO TOWN IN A GENTLER, FEMININE GUISE

Washington, second in the Patrick Division, is unbeaten in its last six games with a 5-0-1 record and has allowed only 13 goals in that span.
The loss cost the Maple Leafs a chance to move into third place in the Norris Division.

LEAD: Micheal Ray Richardson has been indicted by a Bergen County grand jury on charges of illegally cashing a check for more than $9,700.

Cone Hot in Debut With Mets

MEREDITH MONK AND PING CHONG

Deep Six?

ART: CARVINGS BY HAGUE, A MAN OF FEW ANSWERS
LEAD: CONTRIVED mystery, the kind that saves skins or enhances images, is a commonplace.

NAMES AND PLACES: A BIT OF HISTORY
LEAD: If there had been proper research on when Breslau became Lindenhurst, it would not have been erroneously speculated  [ ''What's in a Name?
History,'' About Long Island, March 1 ]  that ''the same sort of wartime sentiment that turned German measles into Liberty measles may have affected the alteration.


THUNDER ON THE RIGHT

Film; WHY HORROR MOVIES STILL GNAW AT US
LEAD: ''G OTHIC,'' A NEW KEN RUS-sell film, begins with music of vibrating doom, ghoulish spirits whizzing past from another world, an insane frothing-at-the-mouth flamenco.
A distant object, floating in the blackness like a murder weapon of some sort, becomes minimally clearer as it approaches, then fills the screen as a human skull while the music booms.


Mary Stuart
LEAD:  To the Editor: I very much enjoyed James Barron's article, ''The Royal Progress'' as well as the others on Mary Queen of Scots and Edinburgh.


Bookshelf

STORM HITS NEW YORK REGION
LEAD: Heavy rains and high winds hit the New York City region yesterday, flooding highways, bringing some rivers to flood stage and damaging power lines and trees.


BUILDING BLOCKS THAT ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS
LEAD: UP TO NOW, I HAVE GENERALLY believed that the best way to interest children in architecture is to let them loose in it - to let them experience soaring space, to let them look up to great height, to let them touch and feel materials and textures and decoration.
There's still no substitute for the real thing, but a close second is the exhibition, ''Building Buildings'' that was recently mounted at the Staten Island Children's Museum at Snug Harbor.


The Epidemic of Traitors
LEAD: The American Embassy in Moscow contains a chamber specially secured against Soviet eavesdropping.
But even this bug-proof bubble may not be secure enough for use by Secretary of State Shultz on his forthcoming visit to Moscow.
The Marine guards who let the K.G.B. roam the embassy may have compromised almost everything done there.


10 AMERICANS TO HEAD FOR SOVIET IN JUNE FOR FRIENDLY FISHING
LEAD: THE Russians have responded to a long cast from an imaginative band of American fly fishermen.


Urologist to Be Honored

ROCK: THE NEW PRETENDERS
LEAD: FROM the Pretenders who released their first album in 1980, only one original member remains - Chrissie Hynde, the band's leader and singer.
The new Pretenders haven't spurred Ms.
Hynde to write songs as unconventional and feisty as her older material.
But on Tuesday at Radio City Music Hall, opening a four-night stand, the band played the daylights out of all its songs; it has the force and tunefulness of the old Pretenders at their best.


FOLK ART WITH AN ELEGANT PRICE
LEAD: ''M ASTERPIECES OF American Folk Art,'' the exhibition that will inaugurate the new Hirschl &amp; Adler Folk gallery this Friday, has already caused both controversy and wide anticipation.
Both reactions are linked to the emphasis in the exhibition on pieces that have been auctioned in recent years for record-setting prices, and to the fact that the show of 24 paintings, weathervanes, whirligigs, painted furniture, stoneware, needlework, quilts and chalkware was organized by the temporarily homeless Museum of American Folk


MT. VERNON HOSPITAL: TRAUMA CARE CITED
LEAD: The article, ''Trauma Centers Designated''  [ March 22 ]  left a false impression that only those hospitals mentioned in the article were ''special'' based upon their total trauma-care capability.


LET'S NOT TALK DOWN TO OURSELVES
LEAD: THIS is a very strange country.
It has created an enormous university system in which flourishes, among the omnium-gatherum of things learnable and pursuable, an intense subculture of poetry and fiction writing.
The outpouring of literary work is so great as to obscure itself, too great to be attended to with the kind of care a slenderer production would allow.


Umpire Talks Make Progress
LEAD: Both sides expressed optimism yesterday that major league umpires would reach a contract agreement in time for tomorrow's opening of the baseball season instead of calling a strike.


WITH THE HUDSON AS BACKDROP, WRITER CREATES A SMALL TOWN
LEAD: THE novelist Roberta Silman cannot see the Hudson River from her home atop a steep hill in Ardsley.
This, she suggested, might not be an altogether negative thing.

Mary Stuart
LEAD:  To the Editor: I would have thought it impossible but your writers, James Barron and A. L. Rowse, have done it.
They have produced a fascinating, accurate and interesting sketch of the life of Mary Queen of Scots (Travel, Feb. 8) without once mentioning John Knox.
Unbelievable but congratulations.


When Travelers Can't Get Off the Ground

JAPANESE TROUPE SEEKS TO SHOCK
LEAD: WHEN AKAJI MARO was casting about for a name for his dance troupe, he hit upon ''camel.'' The animal is misshapen and unattractive -somewhat like the deliberately shocking images Mr.
Maro includes in his dances.


POTVIN REACHES THE 1,000 Mark
LEAD: It was another third-period rally for the Islanders, who this season have used them the way most performers use curtain calls.
Tonight their late-found theatrics not only forced a 6-6 tie that survived overtime, but helped Denis Potvin make hockey history as he became the sport's first defenseman to score 1,000 points.

CARAMOOR CONCERTS TAKE A TRIP INSIDE
LEAD: THE outdoor concerts at Caramoor in Katonah have long been a proud summer tradition in Westchester, but for the most part only the invited guest could partake of recitals in the sumptuously appointed Music Room of the mansion itself.
Happily, the open-to-the-public sign is now up for the indoor cycle of four ''Springtime Serenades'' that begins today at 3 P.M.


U.S. Denies New Sales Of Arms to the Iranians

The Marais
LEAD:  To the Editor: In regard to the article on the Marais section of Paris (''An Old Quarter of Paris Is New Again,'' Travel, Jan. 11), I would like to call attention to a site that was not mentioned.

It is a thrifty farmers' food, brought from the lower Rhineland, in the late 17th century, to Pennsylvania.


If You're Thinking of Living in:; PLEASANTVILLE
LEAD: IN Pleasantville, it has long been the custom around Christmas for villagers to gather at the gazebo near the railroad station to sing carols.

PIANO: BRUCE WOLOSOFF
LEAD: BRUCE WOLOSOFF'S evening of piano music at Weill Recital Hall on Thursday was perhaps more imaginative for its planning than its execution.
There were, for example, two interesting pieces, one old, one new: the Busoni F-minor Sonata and a new sonata by Richard Danielpour.

The bad news is that the New York hub of Continental Airlines, still struggling to digest the People Express whale, will continue to be Terminal B during the height of this year's travel season.


DOLLOPS OF DROLLERY BY NOEL COWARD
LEAD: NOEL COWARD.
THE NAME STILL CONJURES up images of unsurpassed elegance, sophistication and drawing-room wit.
It encompasses an age and an attitude that were, after all, very much part of this century.
All the more startling, then, to find the effervescent Coward fading still further into the fuzzy dimensions of period pieces, still demonstrating his talent to amuse but, more's the pity, looking somewhat quaint and at times perfectly silly.

Focus: Apartments; The Glut Benefits The Renter
LEAD: FOR apartment-seekers in many sections of the country, this is a season of satisfaction, a time of landlord deals and vacant apartments in abundant supply.


TAILORED FOR SUCCESS
LEAD: PAUL J. HANLY JR.'S APPRECIATION of finery is as evident as the tailor-made suit on his back. ''Feel this,'' he urges, extending a sleeve.
And he is right; it does seem unlikely that any off-the-rack facsimile could approximate its softness.


The Palme Investigation
LEAD: I lived for two years in Sweden, studying its politics and culture, and I found Richard Reeves's somewhat sardonic report, ''The Palme Obsession'' (March 1), flawed in its street-smarts certainty.


FISH STEAKS OFFER ADVANTAGE OF SIMPLICITY
LEAD: WHEN I was growing up in England we ate grilled fish often.
But our choice was limited.
Mostly it was mackerel or herring, the inside spread with mustard and the outside rolled in oatmeal.

For special occasions there was trout or salmon.


Will Takeovers Be Bad for Books?

LEAD: Major banks raised the prime rate to 7 3/4 percent, from 7 1/2, an indication that interest rates have bottomed out after a long, slow slide.

The prime's importance has faded and is now mostly symbolic, and most analysts said the increase will not be fully felt at the consumer level for some time.

MAKING LOVE IS NOT AEROBIC - SO WHAT?
LEAD: EXERCISE books and I never seem to work out.

There is the evangelical style, shimmering with such visions as ''painless'' and ''quick'' and ''forever'' (as in slim forever).


IN SHORT
LEAD:  AMERICA'S HEALTH IN THE BALANCE: Choice or Chance?
By Howard H. Hiatt. (Cornelia and Michael Bessie/Harper &amp; Row, $18.95.) Health care in the United States is already rationed, Howard Hiatt argues; the country urgently needs a fairer apportioning of resources that will never be limitless.

REIT's as a Hedge Against Hard Times

WHAT'S NEW IN KOSHER FOOD
LEAD: AT THE first-ever Kosher Food and Life Expo at the Jacob Javits Convention Center last month, more than 50,000 people eagerly noshed their way through everything from gefilte fish to kosher tacos.

Spain

LEAD: PASSING muster with a ''mashgiah,'' a rabbi from one of the several dozen agencies that certify products as kosher, is no piece of cake. ''It's like having another Food and Drug Administration down your back,'' conceded Ms.

IT'S TIME TO USE THE SPADE AND TROWEL
LEAD: THE rush is on to plant, rake, feed and seed.
Even though the weather is ''iffy'' at times, April is the month to put the garden in order.

LETTING LINZ CASTLE CAST A SPELL
LEAD: It's a stop for all trains on the old Orient Express line, but few visitors to Austria get out in Linz, and most foreign motorists on the Vienna-Salzburg superhighway flit past the Linz exit.
They apparently do not realize that the city is famous for the Linzer torte , a renowned cake, and that the old section in the center of town is crammed with Renaissance and Baroque buildings, some with plaques commemorating visits by such composers as Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert and the astronomer Johannes


REVIVAL FOR CARTWRIGHT AND WALKER
LEAD: Motivation is a wondrous thing.
Perhaps that is what the Knicks had lacked throughout the season, when winning games seemed almost secondary to the ever-present squabbles between players and coaches - past and present - and among the players themselves.
All that is left now for the team is to win - and for various individuals to prove that, at least for them, this miserable season has not been a complete waste.


Broadcast TV
LEAD: What do ''Ben-Hur'' (1959) and ''El Cid'' (1961) - due this week on the home screen - share besides Charlton Heston, visual grandeur and music by Miklos Rosza?

Haiti Approves A Constitution

FISH STEAKS OFFER ADVANTAGE OF SIMPLICITY
LEAD: WHEN I was growing up in England we ate grilled fish often.

For special occasions there was trout or salmon.

ROLLER HOCKEY AS AN ART FORM

LEAD: Your article on trauma centers was in general highly informative; however, certain facts require clarification.

I.B.M. Inaugurates a New Standard
LEAD: I.B.M. dropped the other shoe last week.
Its first line of personal computers imprinted on the industry a standard that was to become international, a standard copied, cloned or counterfeited by countless other firms.
Now I.B.M. has about-faced, deserting its own criterion for a brand-new one, albeit one that is also of its own devising.


RECITAL: PETER SERKIN

MUSIN: BLUE GENE TYRANNY
LEAD: BLUE GENE TYRANNY, by which name the composer Robert Sheff usually bills himself, was born in Texas in 1945 and has had a lively career.

Music
LEAD: Although Wagner hardly intended it, ''Parsifal'' and the Easter season have become inextricably linked, and it's that time of year again.
While the Metropolitan Opera's 1970 production of the opera is not exactly news, it's still highly recommendable (it will be staged Monday evening and Saturday afternoon, with two more performances next week).


FRENCH FARE IN BETHEL
LEAD: FROMISES, promises - too many restaurants promise too much.

Cinema Verite

How Medicare Causes Hospital Horrors
LEAD: To the Editor: Dr.
William L. Roper's disclaimer of Government responsibility for the medical atrocities being inflicted on Medicare hospital patients under his department's diagnosis-related-group program is a priceless example of how a literal truth may conceal a monstrous falsehood (letter, March 26).


THE ELUSIVE LANGUAGE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN
LEAD: RILKE was probably right when he wrote that the events of the human body - pain, orgasm, taste, smell -are indescribable.
These are events and experiences for which language offers no solution.
They cannot be conveyed.
The writer falls back from his assault upon these citadels of sensation and contents himself with encircling the body with an array of sentences, besieging it with paragraphs in the hope that he will awaken a connection, however dim, between what his character is feeling and what the reader has felt in his own lifetime.


A War That None Can Afford to Win
LEAD: SEVERAL weeks ago, Art Buchwald suggested that Japanese executives be sent en masse to the Harvard Business School.

The Danger of Disarming

LEAD: The marketing mavens have long made a distinction in 35-millimeter camera sales between potential buyers of single-lens-reflexes (SLR) and those more likely to buy fixed-lens, auto-focusing, point-and-shoot cameras.
They assume, with some logic, that SLR users are a more advanced breed, interested in the controls and options that can make photography fun and possibly even creative.

By Annie Gottlieb. 418 pp.
New York: Times Books. $19.95.
PART history, part handbook, part manifesto and part bugle call to action, Annie Gottlieb's ''Do You Believe in Magic?'' takes a stern but affectionate look at the 1960's and then tries hard to reconcile that era with the present.


Sydney
LEAD:  To the Editor: We were pleased to read about the Sydney Opera House, which brought back memories of our visit in 1984.
We had bought the package ''An Evening at the Sydney Opera House'' before we left.

For those of us who are older and/or arthritic, the numerous steps are an obstacle.

LEAD: WHEN I was 8 years old and living with my family in two large rooms on the second floor of a white frame house in a small South Dakota town, one of my winter diversions was an imaginary basketball game played with a rolled-up sock lofted toward the space between the top of a door frame and the ceiling.

Still Searching
LEAD: NOW that Lefty Driesell, the former Maryland coach, is out of the running for the basketball job at South Alabama, school officials have been looking high and low for another candidate, and, it seems, finding a prospect at each level.
The next step is to decide whether whether to reach up to the pros and hire Bill Musselman of the Rapid City Thrillers, the Continental Basketball Association's coach of the year, or down into the junior college ranks to sign Ronnie Arrow, the San Jacinto coach.


IN 'SAFE SEX,' HARVEY FIERSTEIN TURNS SERIOUS
LEAD: ''I WAS TRYING TO COME TO terms with the situation, with AIDS, that's why I wrote it,'' said Harvey Fierstein of ''Safe Sex,'' the trio of one-act plays that will open tonight at the Lyceum Theater.
He was speaking softly, and his somber demeanor had none of the inspired outrageousness that theater audiences have come to expect on stage: Harvey Fierstein the streetwise imp, Harvey Fierstein the Jewish mother from Bensonhurst, Harvey Fierstein the drag queen with a heart of gold who overcomes life's absurdities with an industrial-strength voice and a face of India rubber.


MORALES CAPS CAREER
LEAD: Pablo Morales of Stanford and Matt Biondi of California finished their college championship swimming careers tonight with victories that made the record books.
So did John VanSant, a senior from Army, which is hardly a national swimming power.


WOMEN AND LAW IN NEW YORK STATE
LEAD: On Feb. 15, the Connecticut Guide column contained an item titled ''Women and Law,'' which discussed a book by Karen Berger Morello.
Alice Miskimin was quoted in paraphrase as stating that female lawyers were not admitted to membership in the New York State Bar Association until the 1930's.
That information was not correct.


A TRIO OF WASHINGTON GUIDES

DELAYS AT NEW YORK AIRPORTS FALL FOR FEBRUARY AND MARCH

A NEW PAGE IN THE SAGA OF THE HIGH PRIEST OF MUSIC
LEAD: THE LONG-AWAITED OPEN-ing of the Toscanini family archives - thousands of scores, books, letters, records and items of memorabilia that have waited 17 years unsorted in a basement while the conductor's heirs dickered with the New York Public Library, and now at last acquired by the library for the benefit of researchers - comes at a moment of something like high drama in the saga of the great Italian conductor's posthumous reputation.


A WORLD WITHOUT NUCLEAR ARMS?
LEAD: It is likely the question was first asked as soon as it could be - that the hope of abolition followed shortly after the task of creation.
J.
Robert Oppenheimer, transfixed in the glare of the first atomic explosion in the New Mexico desert, recalled a verse of the Bhaghavad Gita: ''Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.


Cinema Verite
LEAD: I, too, suffer from Mordecai Richler's obsession with finding errors in film and literature, but I do it for a living (''Cinema Verite,'' Guest Observer, March 8).
As continuity supervisor for a television soap opera, part of my job is to make sure the clocks on the wall show a passage of time, insuring the gas tank reads above ''empty'' when we're going to drive a car somewhere, and watching to see if the actor dials enough numbers when making a call.


Beezie Ives to Wed Frederick C. Childs

LACK OF FIGURES ON RACIAL STRIFE FUELING DISPUTE

History'' most interesting, but I must tell you that Las Cruces is still very much alive and well in New Mexico.

Hidden Treasure
LEAD: The art world these days has all manner of high tech processes for identifying valuable paintings.
But in a pinch, an educated eye and a wet finger will do.
That was all Piero Corsini, an art dealer, had to work with when he thought he spotted an unknown Titian at a London auction last year. ''It was filthy, but I took a little saliva in my hand and rubbed'' two small sections, Mr.


AFTER THE VACATION, WE NEED ONE
LEAD: MY son and I hugged at Kennedy Airport after he and his girlfriend dropped my wife and me there for a business-pleasure weekend in Florida.
As always, I informed him that the will was in the drawer near my side of the bed at home and told him to take care of his sisters if something happened.
As always, we laughed.

JURY'S POWER COMES INTO PLAY IN GOEZ TRIAL
LEAD: THE chief attorney for Bernhard H. Goetz, Barry I.

NEW HAVEN DOG LAW DRAWS MIXED REACTION
LEAD: WHILE some New Haven residents are hoping a newly passed ''pooper scooper'' law will mean cleaner sidewalks and parks, others feel that such change will come about only when dog owners begin acting responsibly.


HOW FAIR IS THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE?
LEAD: THE authors of the Bill of Rights were presumably not leaving anyone out when, in 1791, they wrote that ''Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.'' If they were writing it today, would they give radio and television the same protections?


DANCE: WARSHAW GROUP
LEAD: THE stage was clearly a special place at the Bessie Schonberg Theater on Friday night.

DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE HUDSON: TWO VILLAGES, TWO APPROACHES
LEAD: TWO Hudson River villages, Hastings-on-Hudson and Irvington, are grappling with decisions on what to do with their waterfronts.

When Policy Makers Become Cowboys
LEAD: The staff of the National Security Council ran amok in the Iran-contra affair.

LEAD: An updated text of the New Testament that avoids the use of ''man'' in references covering both men and women was introduced yesterday by the nation's Roman Catholic bishops.


WHO WILL WIN, HAGLER OR LEONARD, AND WHY?
LEAD: When you consider that neither fighter will make less than $11 million for their showdown, both Marvin Hagler and Ray Leonard would seem to be winners, with the I.R.S. finishing a close second.
Nevertheless, only one man will emerge as the middleweight champion and that man will be, simply, Marvelous.


GORBACHEV FOES GO TO THE VIDEOTAPE
LEAD: ''The enemy never sleeps,'' Lenin said.
And last week in Moscow it seemed that foes of the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and his wife, Raisa, were wide awake, possibly smiling.
The reason was an underground video that was said to show Mrs.
Gorbachev all gussied up in fashionable clothes and jewels.


Elite and Less Elite in White South Africa

Frank Angeli of Wilmington.
The Rev.
Dr.
William Evans performed the ceremony.


WHO WILL WIN, HAGLER OR LEONARD, AND WHY?
LEAD: I am sick and tired of hearing how great and unbeatable Marvelous Marvin Hagler is.
Hagler is very beatable and Sugar Ray will prove that.
First, Hagler is strong, but he's only strong if he can connect, and he has never faced a fast and sly fighter like Leonard.
Leonard has only boxed once in five years, against a journeyman.


MUSIC: CONSORT GROUP

AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP'S SPECIAL LEGACY
LEAD: ARTHUR MITCHELL, ONE OF George Balanchine's stars, founded the Dance Theater of Harlem in 1969 with the late Karel Shook.
At the time, it was fair to assume that the new company would be another satellite in the Balanchine empire that was supposedly taking over the American ballet world.
The chief difference, presumably, would be that the dancers were predominantly black rather than white.


LANDMARK STATUS
LEAD: THE guests at a party in New Rochelle ate what they think their ancestors ate in the house where their ancestors lived, at the recent celebration of the awarding of Federal landmark status to the city's oldest house.


CONCERT: BROTT AND BERNSTEIN BY ORATORIO SOCIETY
LEAD: OUR large amateur choruses exist in part to provide people the pleasure of communal singing.
For that purpose - and to help fill our large midtown concert halls - a steady recycling of the great choral masterpieces seems necessary.
But these organizations also serve to explore more unusual repertory.


Paterno's Philosophy
LEAD: HE'S better known for his success on the football field, but Joe Paterno, the Penn State coach, has always had a keen interest in education, so it should come as no surprise that his latest honor comes from the Friends of Libraries USA.
It gave him a life membership and a plaque at a ceremony in Philadelphia on Friday.


RANGEL SEEKS EXONERATION OF MARCUS GARVEY
LEAD: The young J. Edgar Hoover saw him as a threat to the American way, plotted to deport him on subversion charges and finally succeeded in having him convicted of mail fraud.

MUSIC: IMPROVISATIONS BY ZORN AND SHARP
LEAD: THE prospect of two premieres by leading ''downtown'' composers, John Zorn and Elliott Sharp, both of whom have been working on new ways to organize group improvisations, brought a full house to the Alternative Museum on Wednesday night.

The Japanese Left Us With Little Choice
LEAD: WHEN President Reagan announced that he would impose sanctions in response to Japan's failure to comply with last year's semiconductor agreement, it created shock waves around the world.
Stock, bond and currency markets were temporarily thrown into turmoil, the result, many analysts said, of fears of an impending trade war.


FISH STEAKS OFFER ADVANTAGE OF SIMPLICITY
LEAD: WHEN I was growing up in England we ate grilled fish often.
But our choice was limited.
Mostly it was mackerel or herring, the inside spread with mustard and the outside rolled in oatmeal.
The fish were grilled until crisp and served with a mountain of boiled potatoes and butter.
For special occasions there was trout or salmon.


WARM WEATHER IS BLOW TO MAPLE SYRUP CROP
LEAD: The warm spring weather of the last two weeks has been terrible for Victor and Cindy Putnam and hundreds of other maple syrup farmers in New York State and Vermont.

FLOWING PROFILES FOR FALL
LEAD: In one of the first fall and winter showings in New York, shiny seams undulated down the back of a coat, the fronts of some jackets, skirts and a halter-neck dress.

Sometimes the profiles were subtly outlined in black thread on black wool or jersey.


REDS' ERIC DAVIS: A MAJOR TALENT WAITING TO BLOSSOM
LEAD: THE baseball world, always eager to watch the development of a Don Mattingly or a Roger Clemens, breathlessly anticipates the carnage that Eric Davis will commit on National league pitchers and catchers this season.
Cincinnati's center fielder is so exciting a player that observers are prepared to expect him to hit a home run every time up or stroke a mere single, then steal second, third and home.


Mary Stuart
LEAD:  To the Editor: I am writing re ''The Road to Fotheringay,'' concerning Mary Stuart.
Without either defending or castigating the Queen of Scots' husband, Lord Darnley, I, as a gay man, take offense at A. L. Rowse's unfortunate characterization of him as ''worse than useless'' for his having ''preferred the grooms of Holyrood to his wife, the Queen.


THE STORIES BEHIND THE OSCARS
LEAD: WITH EYELIDS THAT BE-come increasingly heavy with every lost minute, we sit through each Academy Awards telecast to find out who wins what award.
We eat and drink as if there's no tomorrow, though tomorrow has already come.

We assume that's the appeal, but we may be wrong.


THE SUDDEN FALL OF A BASEBALL PHENOMENON
LEAD: In the garage on East Elm Street in the Hillsborough section of Tampa, the red Porsche and silver Mercedes stand as the symbols of success.
In the modest one-story house, the agonized looks, the 13-month-old baby and the missing father stand as the symbols of failure.


D.A.R. Operates Trumbull House
LEAD: A March 1 article about the town of Lebanon  [ ''Book Tells of the Life of a Town'' ]  stated that the Jonathan Trumbull House was maintained by the Lebanon Historical Society.
In fact, the Trumbull House, on the green, is owned and maintained by the Connecticut Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution as a museum.

LEAD: AS OF TOMORROW MORNING, visitors to the Tate Gallery in London will at last be able to enjoy the J. M. W. Turner bequest to the British nation as Turner meant them to enjoy it - in a separate building named after him and devoted entirely to his work.

That is how John Van Eck, portfolio manager of the top-performing mutual fund in the first quarter of 1987, explained the latest glitter in precious metal stocks.


Question Box
LEAD: QUESTION:  Has anybody ever played for all four major league teams in New York City - the Mets, the Yankees, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants?
It's never happened, and the person who probably came closest was Sal Maglie, who pitched for the Giants, Dodgers and Yankees in New York before ending his career in 1958, four years before the Mets were born and the first year that the Dodgers and Giants were no longer home teams in New York.


Ted and the Tax Man
LEAD: Memories of yesteryear's stars have always provided an appealing context in which to treasure a new baseball season.

COMFORTED BY WHAT YOU WEAR
LEAD: THEY are generally the type of clothes only a mother could hate: the scuffed shoes that have molded to our feet; the slouchy hat that creases just so; the oversize cotton shirt that, after umpteen washings, is soft and cuddly; the baggy trousers that don't bind.
They are comfort clothes.

LEAD: In 1975, payroll padding charges against a former Assemblyman from Long Island were dismissed by a judge who declared: ''This defendant has been singled out and indicted for his participation in a practice that has prevailed in this state for decades.''

NONPROFIT GROUP TO NOURISH ONCE-SHABBY PROSPECT PARK
LEAD: When Tupper W. Thomas became the Prospect Park administrator seven years ago, ''we had the opposite problem from Central Park,'' she recalled. ''People were just not using the park.''

LEAD: State Senator Roy M. Blake, a deeply conservative Democrat from Nacogdoches, was long a staunch foe of a state income tax for Texas, even sponsoring a constitutional ammendment to ban it in 1985.

LEAD: To most people, a quality undergraduate education means big bucks and, probably, a private institution.

Signs of Life for the Paralyzed Budget

By crushing Congress between the rock of a swelling defense budget and the hard place of his hostility to new taxes, he has worked to deny it any room for domestic spending.

The spotlight last week was on overriding the President's veto of the highway bill.

STAGE: SHAKESPEARE REVUE
LEAD: ''STAND-UP SHAKESPEARE'' is, as its subtitle indicates, ''a motley musical'' - heterogeneous rather than homogeneous.
As directed by Mike Nichols at Theater 890, the show is, alternately, a felicitous musical entertainment and a self-conscious attempt to lead Shakespeare to make fun of himself.

Past Perfect
LEAD: Often the things people treasure have no intrinsic Value whatsoever.
Report cards, photographs, bridal bouquets, menus, matchbooks, letters, locks of hair - they are everything to their owners but nothing to anybody else.

Then their magic is universal.

Make Power Plants Convertible
LEAD: Back in 1978, when the Arab oil embargo and winter shortages of domestic natural gas still loomed large, it seemed like a fine idea to prohibit new electric power plants from burning oil or gas.

Last year, the House voted to dump the Fuel Use Act, and hearings on repeal are expected in the

Chamber Symphony Plays at 92d Street Y
LEAD: The New York Chamber Symphony introduced an appealing new piece by Nicholas Thorne, for bass trombone and orchestra, at the 92d Street Y Saturday evening. ''Songs of Darkness, Power and Radiance'' is the unpromising title (evoking familiar, better ones without achieving their authentic ring, and sounding all too much like a list of the attributes the composer hopes listeners will find in the work), but the concerto impressed as a candidate for wide circulation.

Why Paid Parental Leave Makes Sense
LEAD: Should companies be required by law to allow parents up to 18 weeks of unpaid leave to care for newly born or seriously ill children?

FILM: 'THREE FOR THE ROAD'
LEAD: ''THREE FOR THE ROAD,'' which opens today at the Ziegfeld and other theaters, has no fewer beer cans or car chases or know-nothing jokes than the usual teen-age adventure-comedy.
But it does have a lot less personality than most, which is peculiar.
The director, B. W. L. Norton, and the writers, Richard Martini, Tim Metcalfe and Miguel Tejada-Flores, display no idea whatsoever of how to keep a film moving or how to hold an audience's interest.


Assessing Intelligence Breaches
LEAD: He shuns the word ''vindication'' and is too much the patrician to say, ''I told you so,'' but James J.

A Demolition For the Derby
LEAD: There are plenty of ways to lose the Kentucky Derby, but owners have naturally always cherished those that excuse defeat without diminishing their own opinion of their 3-year-olds: the supposedly hard and cuppy Churchill Downs track, the traffic problems caused by the huge fields, the distractions posed by 100,000 noisy spectators.

Fox), who, when he leaves the Kansas farm, tells his worried mother, ''I want to have a meaningful experience with a beautiful woman.''
His mother remains uncertain.

MUSIC: BERNSTEIN AND THE PHILHARMONIC
LEAD: Most discussions of the music of Ives bear down heavily on his prodigal use of quotation and it is true that in a work such as the Symphony No. 2 he seems to be trying to bring the ancient technique of pastiche to new levels of incongruity.
However, listening last evening to the New York Philharmonic's superlative performance of the piece under Leonard Bernstein one was struck more forcibly by the artistic unity that Ives achieved than by the diversity of his materials.


FROM CASUAL TO CONTINENTAL CUISINE ALONG THE SPRUCED-UP 46TH STREET

STAGE: 'TENT MEETING,' REVIVALIST REBALDRY
LEAD: WITH almost daily reports about sexual peccadilloes among the believers, revivalism is a most suitable subject for theatrical ridicule.

Rockers' Message
LEAD: To the Editor:


Mannes Trio Plays Haydn and Schnabel
LEAD: In the wake of its Naumburg International Chamber Music Award last year, the Mannes Trio came to Alice Tully Hall Wednesday night.
If this interesting program of Haydn, Schnabel and Brahms showed anything, it was the intelligence, ardor and technique of these three young women.
They are also beautifully rehearsed, and each seems to know and sense what the others are going to do.

LEAD:  THE ITALIANS AND THE HOLOCAUST  Persecution, Rescue, and Survival.
By Susan Zuccotti.
Illustrated. 334 pp.
New York: Basic Books. $19.95.


BREAKING THE CYCLE: SUCCESS STORY IN THE STATES
LEAD: In the last six months, studies cascading out of Government offices and private research centers have produced a new consensus on the need to overhaul the welfare system.
This time around, work is perceived as the solution to dependency, and training and job placement as the way for long-term welfare recipients to break out of the cycle.


BARBARA COOK: MIXING CABARET WITH BROADWAY
LEAD: A TYPICAL ONE-PERSON BROAD-way show is a hyperbolic star turn in which a performer is escorted by an entourage onto a glitzed-up stage for an evening of self-congratulation.
But Barbara Cook, who is opening her one-woman show Wednesday at the Ambassador Theater, will not be cavorting with a chorus or ducking in and out of a flashy set.


LESLIE A. CORNFIELD, A LAWYER, IS BRIDE OF MICHAEL URFIRER
LEAD: Leslie Ann Cornfeld, a daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Robert M. Cornfeld of Hollywood, Fla., was married yesterday to Michael James Urfirer, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

LEAD:  BEING INVISIBLE  By Thomas Berger. 262 pp.
Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Company. $16.95.


Intangible But Attainable
LEAD: Silence, light, space and a view are the earth, air, fire and water of homes - elements that are basic to building desirable environments.
There are, however, few apartments or houses with them all, and none, it seems, with too much of them.
Especially in apartments in crowded and expensive urban areas, they have often become luxuries.


SHOULD PRO HOCKEY AND BASKETBALL ALTER PLAYOFF FORMATS?
LEAD: ''If it ain't broke, and it makes money, don't fix it.'' That altered axiom demands that neither the N.H.L. nor the N.B.A. change any aspect of their playoff format.
LAWRENCE S. FOWLER  New York


SHORT (BUT NOT TOO)
LEAD: ON the runways at the recent couture collections, a lot of leg has been showing.
On the street, a little less of it is in evidence.


Winner, by a Surprise
LEAD: Perhaps no punch thrown in the middleweight championship boxing match last week was as stunning as the outcome.
Confounding sportswriters who scoffed at his chances and gamblers who took the 3-1 odds against him, Sugar Ray Leonard, who had not fought in nearly three years, won a split decision over Marvelous Marvin Hagler, who had not lost a bout in 11 years.


The Prisoner Of Seventh Avenue
LEAD: Halston is and was a magnificent talent.
He is an American fashion independent in the genre of Charles James and Rudi Gernreich (victims both!), and that can be brutally frustrating.


LUXURY TODAY
LEAD: Who would have thought that the sight of a walk-in closet would inspire sighs of envy?
Or that a gardener's cottage, charming though it may be, would seem as precious as plover's eggs in a porcelain basket?
Indeed, many aspects of the home that once were taken for granted now seem like life's greatest luxuries.


CAPITALS' MASON STARS IN PLAYOFF DEBUT
LEAD: He started the season in the minor leagues as the odd man out on a team with three equally strong goaltenders.
But Bob Mason emerged tonight as the hero for the Capitals in the third game of their playoff series against the Islanders.


Miss Hubert Wed To Jon Pressman

NEW DISKS: INSOUCIANT CORNET, NICE FIDDLE
LEAD:  Following is a roundup of some of the notable recording releases of recent weeks.
Fedora  Opera by Umberto Giordano.
With Eva Marton and Jose Carreras.
Hungarian Radio and Television Symphony Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Giuseppe Patane.
CBS Masterworks 42181 (all three configurations).


ISLIP SUPERVISOR CITES HIS RECORD
LEAD: Frank Lynn is off-base and takes a cheap shot in his April 5 ''Politics'' column.
In an article seemingly orchestrated by the local Democratic Party, he charges that my appointment as Islip Town Supervisor occurred because I am a ''protege'' of the Islip Republican leader, Anthony Pace.


SPECULATING ON A BELEAGERED OIL GIANT
LEAD: IS Texaco Inc. - under siege by the Pennzoil Company for a legal judgment that could run to $11 billion - a bargain at $32?
If not a bargain, is the stock a reasonable speculation?
What about a wild shot in the dark?
Investors have heard all those opinions in the last week, as Texaco's price slumped by $5 after a legal setback


6,787 MILES OF GAS LINE-AND IT LEAKS
LEAD: FOR two days last week, customers in a South Bronx grocery store smelled gas.
On Wednesday, the second day, the distinctive odor was so strong the manager sprayed air freshener around the checkout counter in the afternoon and told a clerk to call Con Edison.


OPERA: 'CARMELITES' CAST CHANGES
LEAD: THE Metropolitan Opera's current production of Francis Poulenc's ''Dialogues of the Carmelites'' is among the company's very finest, and I cannot imagine anybody interested in music, theater, history, theology or a half-dozen other disciplines allowing himself or herself to miss it.
John Dexter's spartan production, the performances of Jessye Norman, Regine Crespin, Florence Quivar and the conducting of Manuel Rosenthal have already been discussed in these pages.


The Prisoner Of Seventh Avenue
LEAD: ''The Prisoner of Seventh Avenue'' adeptly traces the diminution of the Halston trademark.
Ironically, however, you refer to the famous designer's use of ''ultrasuede shirtdresses and suits in the 1970's.''


GRAMMAR HOTLINES STAY BUSYZ
LEAD: PUZZLED by punctuation?
Riled by rhetoric?
Help may be just a telephone call away.


VARIED PROBLEMS COMPLICATE ISSUE OF GARBAGE DISPOSAL
LEAD: THE disposal of Westchester's garbage, long a focus of debate, took on new complexity last week when private carters were temporarily barred from the resource-recovery plant in Peekskill, municipalities were asked to refrain from delivering bulk refuse and heavy rains created additional problems.


POLITICAL ADS ARE FOCUS OF INQUIRY
LEAD: A conservative organization with tax-exempt status barring it from political work actively tried to influence Congressional campaigns last year with issue-oriented television commercials, according to people solicited for contributions and the group's internal documents.


AUTO INDUSTRY WOES SET TONE FOR CONTRACT TALKS
LEAD: The United Automobile Workers is beginning to develop proposals for a new labor contract amid predictions by union leaders that a crisis in the industry will make negotiations difficult and delicate.


HOME VIDEO: MOVIES

2 Attacks Are Reported Near Lebanon's Border
LEAD: Israeli military helicopters rocketed roads near Shiite Moslem villages in southern Lebanon today, killing two people and wounding four others, according to the state-controlled radio.


WHAT CAPITAL INFLOW?
LEAD: IN article after article, economists and journalists lament the United States' growing dependence on foreign capital.
They raise the terrifying possibility of disgruntled foreign investors rising up en masse, refusing to underwrite our profligate ways, thus raising interest rates and throwing America and the world into recession.


OPERA: MILCHEVA AS DALILA
LEAD: ALEXANDRINA MILCHEVA, a Bulgarian mezzo-soprano and a member of the Bulgarian National Opera in Sofia since 1969, made her Metropolitan Opera debut Wednesday night as Dalila in Saint-Saens's ''Samson et Dalila.''


RESIDENTS OF NEW YORK AREA AMONG GUGGENHEIM FELLOWS
LEAD: The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation has chosen 273 artists, scholars and scientists as winners of its 1987 fellowships.
The awards, which this year total $6,336,000, are given on the basis of unusually distinguished past achievement and exceptional promise for the future.


Digital Finds
LEAD: The good life, these days, generally carries a higher price tag than it once did.
However, there is at least one exception to the mounting cost of good living, and that is the exuberantly expanding field of electronic home entertainment.
In a dramatic reversal of the usual spiral, prices for stereo and video equipment have been going down, and shoppers are happily searching for these affordable luxuries.


SHOULD PRO HOCKEY AND BASKETBALL ALTER PLAYOFF FORMATS?
LEAD: Professional basketball should begin the playoff season the first week of April, immediately following the N.C.A.A. basketball championship tournament, when interest in basketball is at a fever pitch.
The N.B.A. should also cut down on the number of teams eligible for the playoffs - preferably allowing only the top two in each division to compete - thus making the regular season meaningful again.


David Remnick to Wed Esther Fein, a Reporter
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Hyman William Fein of Monsey, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their daughter Esther Beth Fein to David Jay Remnick, a son of Dr. and Mrs.

Q AND A
LEAD:  Rhine Cruising  Question:I want to cruise the Rhine River, starting in Amsterdam and possibly ending in Budapest.
Can you direct me to sources for schedules, rates and first-class accommodations? - H. K., New York


ITALIAN COMFORT IN NEW HAVEN
LEAD: MRESCA'S RISTORANTE in New Haven is something of a sleeper.
It is in a quiet, tree-shaded residential area in the Italian section of town, where one expects to find a typical neighborhood eatery.
Not so.
Although the premises are storefront-tiny, the space is well-utilized, with four smartly napped tables in the ground-level bar and the main dining area up a few steps.


The Raft of the Medusa
LEAD:  To the Editor:


GOOD TIMES ON THE GREAT PLAINS: BEEF PRICES RISE
LEAD: The ranchers' turn has come, cattlemen here in the Western plains are saying.
After years of losses, they are now enjoying an upsurge in profits as one of the economic cycles that rule their fortunes has come full circle.


ASPARAGUS SOON WON'T COST A BUNDLE
LEAD: LIKE so many of the fruits and vegetables on the produce stands, asparagus can be found during most of the year.
Nevertheless they are especially welcomed in spring.
The green of asparagus adds a delectably bright note to seasonal menus.


Contract Dispute Over U.S. Bayonet
LEAD: WHAT it wanted, the Army said, was a bayonet that would do more than simply impale an enemy.
Its specifications called for a bayonet that could also snip double-twisted barbed wire and half-inch rope, even saw through an aircraft fuselage.


ADDING VINYL TILE: IT'S EASIER THAN IT USED TO BE
LEAD: PUTTING down a floor of colorful vinyl tile has long been one of the most popular do-it-yourself projects, and this is truer now than ever before.
Recently, new colors and styles have enabled homeowners to put down floors that rival those of professionals, and improvements in adhesives and flooring materials have made installation simpler and more foolproof than ever before.


SLEEP-IN YACHTS AND EAT-IN LUNCHES
LEAD: YACHT sales are booming. Electric utility rates are dropping.


Reagan on Education
LEAD: President Reagan has a story for every occasion and an excuse for every disaster.

LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
LEAD: SINGLES BY THE HUNDREDS IT was hard to tell who was getting more action, the exhibitors or the attendees at the New York Singles Expo and Convention, held last Sunday at the Holiday Inn in Plainview.
While several hundred single men and women eyed the various displays, they were also busy eyeing one another.


60's CHAPLAINS REFLECT ON STUDENTS TODAY
LEAD: ONE ASPECT of academic life has little to do with finals or grades, professors or administrators.
It is the province of campus chaplains and involves, as the Rev.
William Sloane Coffin describes it, ''the education of the heart.''


IMPORTANT POINTS FOR SPRING PLANTERS
LEAD: PLANTING is the first thing to consider now.
Soil has dried out from the deluge earlier this week and there will be a rush until the end of May to get things into the ground.
First to be set out are container-grown plants, particularly those with woody stems and perennials; these plants will need special attention.


Shots Hit Two Vehicles
LEAD: A motorist was slightly hurt and a section of Interstate 95 was closed for half an hour tonight after bullets hit a pickup truck and a car, the state police said.
One shot shattered the truck's windshield near Exit 18 at about 5:30 P.M.
The driver was cut by glass.

U.S. SENTENCING PLAN URGES FIXED TERMS AND NO PAROLE
LEAD: A Congressionally created commission on Monday will propose the most comprehensive changes ever in the criminal sentencing system used by Federal courts, including the end of parole.


Voices of Spring, Faster and Louder
LEAD: The thawing brooks sounded almost like birdsong, flowing into gray creeks still cuffed with ice which debouched into rivers swelling green with the spring - where phoebes rode down the currents on little ice cakes to grab the first stoneflies.
As the snow melted off the fields, skunks and coons snapped up voles and moles whose tunnels had been exposed; and crows did the same, when they weren't pairing off, stalking around chatting shoulder-to-shoulder, while courting killdeer wheeled in the air overhead as agile as terns.


Chicago's Mayor Gains New Power Along With 2d Term
LEAD: Chicagoans gave Mayor Harold Washington ''all the marbles,'' as he put it, in Tuesday's election.
Not only was he re-elected by a comfortable margin, soundly defeating the alderman who had been a thorn in his side all through his first term; he also won a majority in the City Council.


Press Freedom Challenged at Editors' Meeting
LEAD: ''The press is not free,'' Michael G. Gartner, president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, told his colleagues here this week for their annual meeting.

John F. Desmond of Centerville, Mass.
Msgr.
Eugene Clark performed the Roman Catholic ceremony at the Good Shepherd Church in Beverly Hills,


A BIKE TOUR AROUND DENMARK'S GARDEN
LEAD: Arriving at Steensgaard Herregards Pension by bicycle feels a bit like drawing up to the Plaza Hotel in New York on a motor scooter; a horse-drawn carriage might be more appropriate for both.
Yet at Steensgaard, and for that matter at all of the Danish inns we pedaled to, the guest who arrives by bicycle is no surprise.


Hartford Legislators to Vote on Social Issues
LEAD: The General Assembly, entering the final two months of its legislative session, is preparing to vote on an array of social legislation that could put it at odds with Gov.

SPREADING THE WORD AND SOUND OF JAZZ
LEAD: FOR nearly half a century, Marian McPartland has played piano duets with almost any jazz great you can mention and performed solo in her own trio all over the world.
This week in Connecticut she will be doing what she revels in - performing for and with young people, and talking to them about jazz.


No Excuses
LEAD: Taxpayers still puzzling over their 1986 returns might think twice before telephoning the Internal Revenue Service for help.
A recent study by the General Accounting Office found that the agency gives wrong or incomplete answers to 37 percent of those calling its toll-free help lines.


Regine Crespin Feted By Metropolitan Opera
LEAD: The Metropolitan Opera's general manager, Bruce Crawford, gave an engraved silver tray to Regine Crespin, the French mezzo-soprano, at a ceremony Wednesday evening celebrating her 25th annniversary with the company and her farewell engagement.

LEAD: A three-year contract agreement has been reached between Heinz U.S.A. and migrant workers who pick crops for the company in Ohio and Michigan.


DOES THE HOLOCAUST DEFY DRAMATIZATION
LEAD: IT'S DIFFICULT FOR A TELEVISION dramatization to come to grips with the Holocaust.
Documentaries are better equipped.
A dramatization, no matter how thoughtfully done, is still make-believe.
A documentary need only show us, say, a pile of children's shoes.
We feel a terrible sorrow then; the unimaginable has been expressed.


Pamela T. Brunet Engaged to Marry
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Stuart Brunet of Mendham, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Pamela Tower Brunet, to Andrew George Foster, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

ECONOMY IS THE KEY: THE OUTLOOK
LEAD: In the last six months, studies cascading out of Government offices and private research centers have produced a new consensus on the need to overhaul the welfare system.
This time around, work is perceived as the solution to dependency, and training and job placement as the way for long-term welfare recipients to break out of the cycle.


Exotic Blooms
LEAD: It has been evident for some time that electronic gadgetry is taking over the American home, but a less noted invasion is that of the house plant.
Indoor plants have taken root in our houses and apartments as never before.


Matter of Law
LEAD:  To the Sports Editor:


The Prisoner Of Seventh Avenue
LEAD: Lisa Belkin's article ''The Prisoner of Seventh Avenue'' (March 15) was another reminder that corporate minds and creative minds do not good bedfellows make.
Halston himself said it best when he described one such corporation as ''landing on the Halston planet.''


Yonkers Condo
LEAD:  To the Editor:


THE ELUSIVE ART OF MULTI-TASKING
LEAD: ''CONFUSION to the enemy'' seems to be the main theme of the International Business Machines' long-awaited announcement of a new line of personal computers.
As it turned out, the machines, which were introduced two weeks ago, were not the clone killers they had been previously rumored to be.
But their built-in graphics chips, their improved structure for transporting data within the computer and their monitors, which forsake the digital standard and function more like television sets, will certainly make the job of would-be duplicators more complicated.


Art
LEAD: Daniel Buren, a Frenchman, and Sol LeWitt, an American, are painters who have in common that they work on an environmental scale and in an idiom in which there is no trace of an individual hand.
Buren works primarily with broad vertical stripes that can turn up anywhere, anytime.
Though perfectly at home in museums and galleries, they also have a way of insinuating themselves into metropolitan landscapes the world over.


Kristin Chase Plans to Wed
LEAD: The engagement of Kristin Ann Chase to Donald Beales Taylor has been announced by the parents of the bride-to-be, Mr. and Mrs.
Weldon Alvah Chase of West Simsbury, Conn.

A TROVE IN A TEAHOUSE SETTING
LEAD: MOST OF THE CATEGO-ries of antiquities and medieval works in ''Japanese Art from the Tajima Collection,'' at Sugimoto Works of Art (through May 23), have not been seen often in New York galleries since before World War II.
The occasion for this most unusual low-key exhibition of 35 ancient terra-cotta figures, gilded bronzes, calligraphy, medieval metal mirrors, lacquered boxes, ceramic vessels and paintings is the opening of the new galleries for Japanese art at the Metropolitan Museum on


The Prisoner Of Seventh Avenue
LEAD: One can empathize with Halston's loss of the right to his name.
However, he did receive some compensation.
There is no compensation for any person who buys a ''Halston'' fashion at J.C.
Penney, thinking that the designer at least reviewed, if not actually designed, the garment.
It borders on fraud to market under the name of someone who had no connection.


Baby M Writes a Chapter in History of Families
LEAD: To the Editor:


No Headline
LEAD:  SUBLET IN A CO-OP  Question: I am a rent-stabilized tenant in a Manhattan building that has been converted to a co-op.

In recent months, high-level officials in the Reagan Administration have attacked bloated, inefficient and irresponsible management.
Wall Street has succumbed to scandal.
Military contractors have admitted to overcharging the Pentagon.


B.B.B. OFFERS SETTLEMENT SERVICE
LEAD: Although the third of five articles on litigation (March 29) dealt with alternatives to suing, it overlooked the Better Business Bureau's mediation-arbitration program to settle customer-business disputes, which has been offered to New Jersey consumers since 1976.


EXPERTS FIND LAG ON TESTING DRUGS IN AIDS PATIENTS
LEAD: Important human trials of drugs potentially useful in treating AIDS have been delayed for months by technical, ethical and financial problems, bureaucratic sluggishness and lack of cooperation from a major manufacturer, according to experts in AIDS research.


NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME?
LEAD: THE TALL, ATHLETIC-LOOKING executive drops into a wing chair in his elegant, antique-filled office at Capital Cities/ ABC headquarters on East 51st Street in Manhattan.
Then, turning to a guest, Thomas S. Murphy, the 61-year-old chairman of the media conglomerate, eagerly begins to recite the previous night's ratings from memory.

LEAD: To the Editor: As a professional photographer, I always have my camera and film bag hand checked at airport security gates.
At the Newark, St.

LEAD: READING ABOUT THE $39.9 MIL-lion that was paid just the other day at Christie's in London for van Gogh's ''Sunflowers,'' I was reminded of an illustration that ran in the London Graphic exactly 100 years ago.

Tax Tip: Refinanced Mortgages
LEAD: As procrastinators race to finish their tax returns by Wednesday, many may still be confused by new rules governing interest on refinanced mortgages.
That is a big issue for two reasons: millions of Americans refinanced home loans last year as interest rates fell, and the new tax law rules on refinancings are retroactive to loans closed after last Aug.

Rabbi Daniel Wolk performed the ceremony at the Pierre Hotel.


A CONDUCTOR WITH ROOTS DEEP IN THE BACH TRADITION
LEAD: HELMUTH RILLING HAS won an international reputation as a Baroque conductor with an externally conservative style far out of step with that of the ensembles that have contributed most prominently to this decade's understanding of Bach and his contemporaries.
When he comes to Carnegie Hall Saturday and next Sunday with his chorus, the Gachinger Kantorei, it will not be to offer the prospect of any new discoveries about the masterworks being performed nor about Baroque or Classical performance style, but rather the fruits of a long, deep immersion in the sacred choral literature of


Headliners; Out, on a Judgment Error
LEAD: Al Campanis of the Los Angeles Dodgers was caught leaning the wrong way last week.
Mr.
Campanis, who is in charge of player personnel, resigned under pressure after saying on television that blacks might not be qualified to be baseball managers or executives.
Appearing on an ABC News ''Nightline'' program that observed the 40th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's debut as the first black major leaguer, Mr.


SHOULD PRO HOCKEY AND BASKETBALL ALTER PLAYOFF FORMATS?
LEAD: It doesn't matter.
The regular seasons of hockey and basketball are just a mediocre form of entertainment anyway.
By the time the long, drawn-out seasons lead into the long, drawn-out playoffs, baseball is around to rescue real sports fans from the doldrums of winter. (But I suppose that if there are fans of pro hockey and basketball, then a shorter road to the championship is in order.)


TWO 'ODD COUPLES' ARE BETTER THAN ONE
LEAD: THEATER THREE in Port Jefferson is alternating productions of the male version of Neil Simon's ''Odd Couple'' with a female version of that play.

THE LIBRARY OF NONEXISTENT CLASSICS
LEAD: IS reality necessary?
Lighthearted, lightfooted reader, do not flee!
Our subject is no tough ontological rind. (Philosophers, go home.) It is, rather, the mazy gossamer of make-believe; the desire to be invisible; the longing for strange histories that never were; the urge to slip loose from one's own life.


LIVING WITH LUXURY IN A SMALL SPACE
LEAD: On the grounds of large homes in resort or suburban communities, small cottages built decades ago for gardeners or gatekeepers or guests are now some of the most sought-after dwellings.
Designed to meld with the grander main house on the property, these ancillary buildings have all the charm of their larger counterparts, yet require only minimal upkeep.

LEAD: Irish ceramic art, though lacking the native historical tradition of handknitting or crystal manufacture, has recently begun to earn a presence as an expression of the country's national life and a reflection of its landscape.

MOUNTING COMPETITION FOR COLLEGE TEACHERS
LEAD: IF THERE is a talented black historian out there driving a taxicab because he thinks there is still an oversupply of college professors, Wesleyan University has a message for him: Reports of the glut have been greatly exaggerated.

IMPROVING EFFICIENCY IN STATE GOVERNMENT
LEAD: While I appreciate Martin Bierbaum's perspective in his March 15 Opinion Page article, ''Making Rules to Unmake Rules,'' he errs in assuming that the ''regulatory czar'' bill that I recently introduced represents the only effort being made by the Legislature to grapple with the complex problem of excess bureaucracy.

BORDERLINE COOPERATION
LEAD: POLLUTION is no respecter of national frontiers.
Fallout from Chernobyl was blown across a dozen countries.
Toxic chemicals flushed down the Rhine in Basel wiped out river life in France, West Germany and Holland.
And half the trees in the Black Forest were found damaged by sulfurous fumes, mostly from Eastern Europe.


At Your Service
LEAD: Long ago, personal servants usually relieved well-to-do homeowners of the petty nuisances and inconveniences littering life.
But now that service staffs are almost obsolete, the electronics industry has begun to manufacture a new type of product.
Although perhaps not intended to fill this service void, these devices can do a noble job of freeing us from trivial details, usually at a much lower cost than servants - but without their human attributes.

Jackie Robinson, Hero
LEAD: MY father worked at a news agency, so we often heard the big news before it was on the radio or in the papers.

How would we manage without him?

LEAD: LAST WINTER, after 25 years of being a class clown, Murray Rosenthal finally got what he deserved - a moment in the spotlight.


Everyday Artifacts
LEAD: One day, we may marvel that it took so long for the artifacts of daily life to be recognized as works of art.

UNDER CLOUDS OF DITRUST, SHULTZ HEADS FOR MOSCOW
LEAD: NO eavesdropping equipment is required to detect what Soviet and American participants want from Secretary of State George P. Shultz's visit here.

FOLK-ROCK: THE FORT IN SERIES
LEAD: THE 1960's folk scene takes a time-warp into the 1980's at the Fort -a movable hootenanny and self-described ''anti-showcase'' that has been settling in various downtown clubs over the last year.

STRETCH FABRICS, SMOOTH FIT
LEAD: MANY designers are using elasticized fabrics for fall to achieve a really smooth fit.

Sally-Jane Heit In Comedy and Music
LEAD: The characters that the comedian and singer Sally-Jane Heit portrays in her one-woman show are mature urban women up to their necks in complications and generational contradictions.

A GOLDEN RULE FOR SOFTWARE
LEAD: IN THE classroom and elsewhere, educational floppy disks are entitled to the same copyright protection as the more traditional textbooks.
But while illegally duplicated books are easy to spot, the same is not true of software; Once tucked inside a personal computer, the disks are invisible.

TOO MUCH CAR, TOO LITTLE ROAD

ASPARAGUS SOON WON'T COST A BUNDLE
LEAD: LIKE so many of the fruits and vegetables on the produce stands, asparagus can be found during most of the year.

DELIGHTING IN THE DISORDER OF THREE CHOREOGRAPHERS
LEAD: THE 17TH-CENTURY POET Robert Herrick had some words for it: ''delight in disorder'' and ''wild civility.'' So did Shakespeare when he spoke of ''so musical a discord, such sweet thunder.'' Neither poet was referring to dance.

Numbers Game
LEAD: I didn't have any trouble solving the March 22 crossword puzzle, ''Numbers Game'' (edited by Eugene T. Maleska).

Creature Comforts
LEAD: My litany of household luxuries is simpler than most - I don't really want to live with taffeta curtains that puddle on the floor, with walls tinted by layers of hand-rubbed lacquer or even with a roomful of 18th-century museum-quality antiques.
Luxuries like these are too costly and too obvious for my tastes.


Broadcast TV
LEAD: In size, scope and impact, Franco Zeffirelli's ''Jesus of Nazareth,'' is the most formidable of the biblical-theme films showing this pre-Easter week on the home screen.

Sons on Sidelines
LEAD: TO keep the new basketball coaching staff at Washington State straight, you don't need a program so much as a genealogy.

One of his assistants is Dave Harshman, a former high school and junior college coach, whose father is Marv Harshman, a long-time coach at both Washington and Washington State.


MEN'S STYLE
LEAD: THE THREE-BUTTON suit, long perceived as an emblem of decorum, is quietly making a comeback.

Building in the Classic Style
LEAD: Once upon a time, luxury meant one advantage above all others - space.
Sure, a grander house had more elaborate architectural details, finer construction and more bathrooms, but the real plus it had to offer was room.

The ad budget is in the area of $13 million.


The Yankees, Out of Sight
LEAD: For most Yankee fans in New York this year, ''take me out to the ballgame'' doesn't celebrate the pleasures of live baseball so much as it laments a sad necessity: Going to the stadium will be the only way to see the team play.

Twice Bitten
LEAD: Among the multitude of S.M.U. football players headed for new campuses is Tony Brown, who's getting fed up.
Brown was a freshman at Texas-Arlington when that school dropped football for financial reasons after the 1985 season.
He became a part-time starter at fullback for the Mustangs last fall, but now, after just two seasons of college play, has twice seen his team fold out from under him.


Question Box
LEAD:  QUESTION: A Red Sox left-hander named Billy Rohr just missed a no-hitter against the Yankees on opening day in his major league debut about 20 years ago.

What ever became of Rohr?


LIGHTNING STRIKES
LEAD: WHEN asked about the chances of repeating his theatrical Masters victory of last year, Jack Nicklaus joked, ''I'm going out to look for some lightning; maybe I can catch it again.''

ENLISTING THE YOUNG IN PUBLIC SERVICE
LEAD: The idea has been around a long time.


Shultz and Africa Trip
LEAD: Secretary of State George P. Shultz has dearly wanted to make a trip to southern Africa before leaving office, and State Department officials were hoping to plan one for July.

TRANSCANADA MAKES OFFER FOR DOME
LEAD: TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. today offered what it said was the equivalent of $4.3 billion, about $3.29 million in United States currency, for the assets of Dome Petroleum Ltd.

LEAD: MARIA CHENG began with some talk on the business and art of dance today, in a program presented by the Maria Cheng Dance Company on Friday evening at the Triplex Theater.

But the rest of the evening was disappointing, though Ms.


SERIES TIED; ISLANDERS FALL TO CAPITALS BY 4-1 AND FACE ELIMINATION
LEAD: The Islanders play better when they are desperate, or so they tell themselves.
Evidently, they weren't worried enough after falling behind the Capitals, two games to one, in their playoff series after Saturday night's game.

Not a National Disaster
LEAD: The near hysteria over espionage these days has produced a thriller atmosphere without the sober reasoning of the best spy thrillers.
The preposterous Senate vote recommending that Secretary of State George Shultz cancel his trip to Moscow was an impulse of thoughtless indignation without concern for policy.


FLYERS ANTICIPATING COMFORTS OF HOME
LEAD: From the Flyers' point of view, their mission was accomplished in New York during their series against the Rangers despite last night's loss.


2 'Executed' With Gun On Street in Brooklyn

LEAD: A New York-based human rights organization has started a campaign to have the Khmer Rouge tried for genocide before the International Court of Justice.


Kim Kashkashian Offers Viola Recital
LEAD: Kim Kashkashian's viola recital Thursday night at the Metropolitan Museum was pristine and deeply satisfying.
The viola is too often played as if it were a slightly hoarser version of a violin; less often (and usually more grotesquely) it is treated like a surrogate cello.
In fact, of course, at the risk of sounding obvious, it is itself - an instrument of patrician expressivity, with a burnished luster to its alto tone, its somewhat closeted sound made up of wonderfully variegated shades of gray.


G.L. ARTAMONOFF, A SEARS LEADER
LEAD: Col.
George Leonidovich Artamonoff, 84 years old, the first president of Sears International Inc. and later director of the Tokyo office of the Marshall Plan, died Saturday of pneumonia in the Potomac Valley Nursing Home in Rockville, Md.

Illuminating Iran Affair
LEAD: With the public Congressional hearings on the Iran-contra affair scheduled to begin in three weeks, the investigative committees are trying to figure out a way the audience in the hearing room and people watching on television can follow along when documents are entered into evidence.

Advertising; Agency's Lesson in Survival
LEAD: THE J. G. Durand Compagnie of Arques, France, is making its debut as an advertiser on American television with a line of low-priced crystal and a line of all-purpose cookware.

Stuffing the Rush
LEAD: The wheels of justice sometimes turn at such a snail's pace that impatient litigants cry out for streamlined court procedures that would produce quicker decisions even at the expense of more thorough airing of the disputed issues.
Now, however, no less an authority than the Chief Justice of the United States, William H.


FINANCE BRIEFS
LEAD: *
Apache Corp. is offering $90 million of Ba-3/BB- rated 7 1/2 percent convertible subordinated debentures due in 2012 at 100 through Smith Barney, Harris Upham.

All in the Family
LEAD: Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau's widening probe of hiring abuses by state legislators prompts emulation by prosecutors in the other boroughs.

FOR BLACKS, LOCKER ROOM DOESN'T LEAD TO BOARD ROOM

FOLLOWING HIS WHIMSY, SHANDLING FINDS SUCCESS
LEAD: AMBLING along on Showtime for the past couple of seasons, ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' has become the pay cable crowd's ''Late Night With David Letterman.'' Like NBC's Mr.
Letterman, Mr.

He is a well-meaning, rational soul buffeted by a world overdosing on silliness.

YANKEE IS DOWN BUT NOT OUT
LEAD: Under more normal circumstances, the less successful games do not take as long to replay when Bob Tewksbury goes home at night and turns on the video cassette recorder in his mind.

Night to Remember
LEAD: The words on a 14-by-18-foot billboard outside the Spectrum in Philadelphia bore last night's theme: ''We'll never fill your shoes.
Thanks for everything Doc.'' The words were surrounded by 50,000 signatures of Julius Erving's fans.
It was Dr.
J's last regular-season home game after 11 years with the 76ers, and a sellout crowd of 17,967 was present.

Good Friday, A Quiet Prayer and Hope
LEAD: Worshipers yesterday at St.
Bartholomew's Episcopal Church on Park Avenue as Christians around the world joined in observing the most solemn day in the church year.
It is followed closely by the most joyous of Christian holidays, Easter Sunday. (NYT/Neal Boenzi)


EUROPE, TOO, POSTS 'NO DUMPING' SIGNS FOR JAPANESE FIRMS
LEAD: WESTERN EUROPE, like the United States, is using far more than words in its trade disputes with Japan.
Europe, in fact, seized the weapon of duties against Japan well before Washington decided to impose high tariffs, which went into effect Friday, on some Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for the purported ''dumping'' of computer chips at unfairly low prices.


DEER ARE THE DINNER GUESTS
LEAD: Some of the 60 deer that live at Heckscher State Park dining on corn left by park employees.
The 3 P.M. feeding has become a daily attraction for local residents, but it ends today. ''Once the weather gets warm and all the people start coming here, we won't see the deer,'' said the park superintendent, Fred O'Neill.

Mary Pride Schuler Marries Dr. William Winkenwerder
LEAD: Mary Pride Schuler, the daughter of William Moughon Schuler of Birmingham, Ala., and Mary Fountain of Charleston, Ore., was married yesterday to Dr.
William Winkenwerder Jr., a son of Mr.
Winkenwerder and Martha Loew, both of Asheville, N.C.
The Rev.
Dr.
John D. Hewitt performed the ceremony at the First Baptist Church in


I AM CINDERELLA'S STEPMOTHER AND I KNOW MY RIGHTS
LEAD: I have been asked to verify for those to whom it is not immediately apparent that since the following is a work of fiction (inspired by the recent suit against the movie based on Sylvia Plath's ''Bell Jar'') ''written by'' a person who never existed, the events referred to in it could not have taken place.


Iran Reports New Raids on Iraq
LEAD: Iran asserted today that its troops and allied Kurdish irregulars had killed 1,500 Iraqis in hit-and-run attacks in the Kurdistan mountains, where a smoldering guerrilla war is heating up.


SWEDES IN NEW JERSEY
LEAD: ALTHOUGH no one seems to mind that the first Swedish settlers in New Jersey did not arrive 350 years ago, the state will participate in New Sweden 88, a celebration of 350 years of Swedish settlement in Delaware and New Jersey.


RECIPES TO KEEP IN HAND FOR THOSE TASTY ASPARAGUS SPEARS
LEAD: IN April and May asparagus is cheap and plentiful.
It comes in many sizes, from thin as a pencil to almost as thick as sugar cane.
All sizes are good - whether you like your asparagus served hot with melted butter and lemon juice or cold with a vinaigrette.
But after awhile, I like to be more adventurous, and serve asparagus with a puree of red peppers sprinkled with fresh tarragon or, as the Italians do, with Parmesan cheese and baked in a hot oven.


Outdoors; Canada Increases Its Support for Salmon
LEAD: CANADA is giving greater recognition to the economic role played by its Atlantic salmon sport fishery, a development that delights the Atlantic Salmon Federation, a nonprofit conservation organization with branches in that country and the United States.


Hhway Math
LEAD:  To the Editor:


HOSPITAL FEES SOAR UNDER NEW SYSTEM
LEAD: A NEW hospital-payment system intended to contain costs has raised rates an average of 18 percent for inpatient treatment and has sometimes produced charges of more than $9,000 for an overnight stay.


NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: Seattle; Designing By Committee
LEAD: FOR nearly 30 years, Seattle has been trying to build a downtown public square and, later, a shopping mall.
Critics say that the effort has become a textbook example of the problems that are inherent in urban planning.


CENTRAL AMERICA'S ARMS BUILDUP: THE RISK OF GUNS WITHOUT BUTTER
LEAD: As Central America undergoes the most rapid military buildup in its history, with forceful American participation, civilian government leaders and diplomats are concerned about prospects for weak governments that must deal with the vastly strengthened armies in their countries.


WHEN ALL IS NOT ENOUGH
LEAD: IN a world where few drivers can remember life before cruise control, automakers are scrambling to develop new amenities to win over well-off buyers who are used to being pampered.


THE MOST ITALIAN OF SPIRITS
LEAD: In Italy, mornings are for cappuccino, but in northern Italy, they're also for a tiny cup of syrupy espresso with a shot of fiery grappa, the most Italian of spirits.


CRIME
LEAD: LAST JUDGMENT by Richard Hugo (Stein &amp; Day, $16.95) is a very fine book.
Its prologue goes back to the German invasion of Poland in 1939 and the theft of an unknown da Vinci painting.
Switch to the present, and the apparently unrelated mass murder of a family in London. ''I am the incubus of pure terror,'' says the killer as he pulls the trigger.


Q. &amp; A.: Stephen G. Breyer; WITH UNIFORM SENTENCING - SAME CRIME, SAME TIME
LEAD: TOWARD the end of 1985, the United States Sentencing Commission took up the task of making punishment for Federal crimes more uniform, effective and fair.
Last week it recommended ranges of sentencing for 43 categories of crimes, based on a statistical analysis of present sentences.
Convicts would no longer be paroled, more time would be served for drug-related offenses and prison would be prescribed for many white-collar crimes under guidelines that become binding on Federal judges Nov.


EQUALIZERS CHIP IN WITH INTELLIGENCE
LEAD: MORE AND MORE these days, machines are taking over the tasks that some people aren't smart enough to do themselves.
If you don't know how to add, all you need is a pocket calculator; and if you don't know how to spell, a modern typewriter can help you out with some computerized orthography.
That kind of handy automation has lately come to audio in the form of self-regulating equalizers.


SHOULD GRIPES AGAINST BROKERS GO TO ARBITRATION?
LEAD: From time to time, an article receives a particularly strong response from readers.
Whenever possible, we will print a large number of those letters.


Next Week; What Do Giants and Jets Need In the Draft?
LEAD: Replies for publication should be no more than 300 words and addressed to Sunday Sports Section, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y., 10036.
Letters should include the writer's name, address and telephone number.
We regret that because of the large volume of mail received, we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters.


IS THE LABOR PARTY AN ENDANGERED SPECIES?
LEAD: BY midweek, politicians were streaming out of the capital for Britain's protracted ''Easter hols,'' and that may be the best news the Labor Party and its leader, Neil Kinnock, have received all year.
Recent polls showed Labor 10 to 13 points behind the Conservatives, but barely holding onto second place over the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats, which hopes to displace Labor as one of the two major parties.


Tech Transfer
LEAD:  To the Editor:


'FREQUENT FLIERS' CRYING FOUL AS AIRLINES CHANGE THE RULES
LEAD: For the past seven years Raymond W. Zrike went out of his way to fly Trans World Airlines, and last month it was about to pay off: he passed the 90,000-mile mark, enough to get two free first-class round-trip tickets to Europe.


ROONEY IS FUNNY THING AT FORUM
LEAD: MICKEY ROONEY stars in ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' which is making a fast stop at the Westbury Music Fair during its current national tour.


WRITING THAT ANGRY LETTER
LEAD: There is a glutted file in this department where copies of travelers' letters of complaint accumulate.
Some are heartrending, some are amazing; all are angry.
The opposite of the little black box that emits applause sounds when the lid is lifted, this file drawer seems to give off steam and sounds of fury when opened.


Argentina Thwarts Military Rebellion
LEAD: When an Argentine Army officer refused last week to be questioned in court about allegations of human rights abuses, he precipitated a serious challenge to the three-year-old civilian Government of President Raul Alfonsin.


CHILDREN'S BOOKS: BOOKSHELF
LEAD: Additional titles of interest:


TIGHTENING THE REINS IN BALLISTIC MISSLE RACE
LEAD: IN South America, Argentina and Brazil are to be the proud new owners of ballistic missiles.
On the subcontinent, India leads Pakistan in the race to obtain powerful missiles.
Asian nations that rim the Pacific - the Koreas, Taiwan, Indonesia - are climbing the technical ladder toward mastery of missile technology.


MINING A CD CATALOGUE
LEAD: AS COMPACT DISKS BE-come plentiful enough so that record companies have to compete for buyer attention, an illuminating insight into CD marketing is provided by the first installment of reissues from the Vanguard Recording Society.


HART JUMPS IN, RIVALS UNDISMAYED
LEAD: PERCHED on a rock in Red Rocks Park, Colo., last Monday, Gary Hart became the third official candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination. ''I make this race because I love my country and I want America to do better and move forward,'' the former Senator from Colorado said.
He promised a campaign of ideas.


ENROLLMENT OF MINORITIES IN COLLEGES STAGNATING
LEAD: Two decades after colleges and universities began opening their doors to substantial numbers of minority students, the effort to diversify American higher education appears to have stagnated.


SHOULD GRIPES AGAINST BROKERS GO TO ARBITRATION?
LEAD: From time to time, an article receives a particularly strong response from readers.
Whenever possible, we will print a large number of those letters.

NEW ORLEANS, AND ALL THAT JAZZ
LEAD: What Lincoln Steffens wrote of Paris well describes New Orleans, our belle ville at the bottom of America: ''A loose merger of many, very many small provincial communities, each of which is pleasantly or offensively clannish.''


SAMURAI SUCCESS: FIND MARKET AND CONQUER
LEAD: LORNA Altemus was shopping for a new Jeep when she came upon a magazine article comparing the Suzuki Samurai with several other four-wheel-drive vehicles.


Play IT AGAIN, SAM
LEAD: EVAN EISENBERG'S ''THE Recording Angel: Explorations in Phonography'' (McGraw-Hill) seems to be the first full-length book on the implications and effects of recording on music.
It's bursting with ideas, taking up topics from the ties between ritual and music to the compression that 78-rpm records brought to the classic blues.


Headliners; Voted In
LEAD: The Bronx, whose political leadership has lately hinged more on the ballots cast by grand jurors than on those of ordinary voters, got a new Borough President last week.
City Council members from the borough chose Fernando Ferrer for the post, which was vacated last month when Stanley Simon resigned from the office as he was about to be indicted various charges.


LEFT COLD BY CARS: A WOMAN'S STRUGGLE
LEAD: I have a confession to make, and this seems as fitting a place and as good a time to make it as any.
I cannot change a tire.
Nor can I differentiate between the carburetor, if cars still have such things, and the radiator, air filter, gear box or condenser.
In a crisis, when the hood of the car is sprung open, revealing the grayish-brown tangle of hoses and boxes and releasing the thick, warm odor of melting rubber,


McCauley's Plot Revealed
LEAD:  To the Editor:


PUTTING A PRICE ON ANGER OVER IMPORTS
LEAD: PRESIDENT REAGAN retaliated last week against Japanese trading practices that, the Administration said, violated a 1986 computer chip agreement.
He imposed tariffs that may double the price of some color television sets, computers and power tools.
Retailers said consumers should feel little effect, except for those who buy laptop computers.


Comatose Man's Family Seeks Removal of His Feeding Tube
LEAD: The family of a 34-year-old exercise physiologist, hospitalized at the Westchester County Medical Center in a vegetative state, has asked a state appeals court for permission to remove a feeding tube - an act that his family said he had indicated he would favor.


THE PAST INTRUDES UPON A WEDDING LIST
LEAD: JACKIE, our youngest daughter, will be married this summer.
Just as Jackie is the youngest of 5, I was the youngest of 6, and my mother was the youngest of 11.
So when I sit down to write the invitations for Jackie's wedding, I remember again what being the youngest daughter of a youngest daughter meant to me.


SUNDAY OBSERVER
LEAD: WELL, WE HAD the usual big April to-do this week at our house.
The worst moment came when Clemmie, 14 months old, got lost in the file cabinets.


Castro Says Harmony Is Up to U.S.
LEAD: Shortly after midnight in the starkly modern Palace of the Revolution, Fidel Castro was presenting himself as the good neighbor.


SCHMIDT BELTS NO.500
LEAD: Mike Schmidt became the 14th major-league player to hit 500 career home runs when his two-out, three-run belt in the ninth inning off Don Robinson today rallied the Philadelphia Phillies to an 8-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.


'THE SLEEPING BEAUTY' AWAKENS ANEW
LEAD: EVER SINCE ITS PREMIERE IN St.
Petersburg in 1890, ''The Sleeping Beauty'' has been admired for its sumptuous music by Tchaikovsky and dazzling choreography by Marius Petipa.
Yet, if Russia is that ballet's birthplace, Great Britain may be its second home; many important productions of the ballet have taken place in Britain, and others have been staged elsewhere by


Apartheid and the West
LEAD:  To the Editor:


Miss Locke Plans To Marry June 20
LEAD: The engagement of Susan Andrea Locke to Nicholas Daland Peirson, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Edward L. Peirson of Corning, N.Y., has been announced by Jean Locke of Gilford, N.H., and Kent Locke of Sanborton, N.H., parents of the bride-to-be.
A June 20 wedding is planned.


FRANCE: CRITICS BLAST BALLET ABOUT MALRAUX

Fanfani Is Sworn In as Head of Italy's 46th Postwar Cabinet
LEAD: Amintore Fanfani was sworn in today as Prime Minister of a minority Italian Government that is expected to lose a vote of confidence in Parliament in the coming week, paving the way for elections June 14.


Bonnie Smith Engaged To Gordon Gannon 3d
LEAD: Announcement has been made by Robert C. K. Smith of Short Hills, N.J., of the engagement of his daughter Bonnie Diane Smith to Gordon Gannon 3d, a son of Rita Burke Gannon of Lake View, N.Y., and Mr.
Gannon Jr. of Buffalo.
A June wedding is planned.


TRIALS OF A TEMPORARY BACHELOR
LEAD: FOR just about the whole first week, everything around here was in apple-pie order.
The three of us all get up at different times to go to work and, like Dagwood Bumstead, at top speed, washing-shaving-toothbrushing-dres-sing zap!!, out the door, but nobody was ever late because clean clothes and toiletries were in good supply and easy to find.


FAMOUS THOUGHTS ON SOME SPECIAL CARS
LEAD: SLEEK and sassy or sturdy and comfortable, slow to start or quick to stop - whatever the style, many people who've gone on to bigger and better things cling to memories of their first cars.


The Leaks In N.B.A. Umbrella
LEAD: Its nickname was derived from the Valley of the Sun, but this pro basketball franchise should be known now as the Phoenix Shadows.


Dial Sets Record
LEAD: IN a performance heightened by controversy, Joe Dial soared 19 feet 4 3/4 inches yesterday at the Kansas Relays in Lawrence, Kan., to break his American pole-vault record.


MAKING OLD WOOD NEW AGAIN WITH CHEMICAL PAINT STRIPPER
LEAD: STRIPPING paint or varnish from a valued piece of wood furniture is a time-consuming, tedious job no matter what method is used.
However, in many cases it is the only way to restore the original beauty of the natural wood, and it is an essential preparatory step before you can stain or bleach the wood.


THE MALLING OF MAIN STREET
LEAD: NOT too long ago, shopping along Greenwich Avenue in stately old Greenwich, Conn., was a strictly local affair.
The merchants were familiar figures in the town of 60,000, and the only businesses owned by outsiders were Woolworth's and the telephone company.


THE TERRIFYING NORMALACY OF AIDS
LEAD: DISNEY'S EPCOT CENTER in Orlando, Fla., is a technological tour de force and a conceptual desert.
In this permanent World's Fair, American industrial giants have built their versions of an unblemished future.
These masterful entertainments convey but one message, brilliantly packaged and relentlessly expressed: progress through technology is the solution to all human problems.

LEAD:  Save the Panda  National Geographic. Vestron Video. 1986. 60 minutes. $29.95.


WHT'S NEW IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE TELEVISION
LEAD: ROBERT HITCHENS, until recently a salesman for the Spanish International Network in New York, used to find selling advertising on Spanish-language programs a thankless task. ''We kidded about the orders we got: Get out, stay out, don't come back,'' he recalled.


DANCE: DOUGLAS DUNN PRESENTS 'LIGHT, O TEASE'
LEAD: THE setting was familiar, with the usual bare white walls and clear wood floor serving as a theater for Douglas Dunn's ''Light, O Tease,'' performed on Tuesday at Mr.
Dunn's SoHo studio.
But once the new piece began, the space became a cage full of exotic birds, peculiar yet instantly recognizable as they picked their way along the knotty bypaths of modern-day human mating rituals.

He was 39 years old and lived in Manhattan.


Japan: Tokyo Builds A Shakespearean Theater
LEAD: FROM REMOVING FIG LEAVES on Italian masterpieces to censoring films in Hong Kong to protecting antiquities in Israel, culture the world over provokes heated debate.


New York Youth Dies on Trip
LEAD: A New York City teen-ager died this week, apparently of alcohol poisoning, during a school trip to the Soviet Union.
The youth, Damon Walsh, 16 years old, was found dead in his Leningrad hotel room Friday by a chaperone, said Jerry Aldredge, dean of resident students at St.
Johnsbury Academy here.


An Older Father
LEAD: When his son is a teen-ager, Richard Taylor will be in his 80's.
The chances of his being at his son's graduation from high school, not to mention college, are minimal.
No service was done to little Aristotle Eli when he was born to a man close to 70 and a woman in her early 20's.
Rather than being a loving, nurturing event, the birth of Aristotle is another example, albeit a subtle one, of the narcissism of our time.


ARGENTINA DELAYS ATTACK ON REBELS
LEAD: Argentina's civilian Government today delayed moves to crush a mutiny by infantry officers who are demanding amnesty for members of the security forces accused of human-rights abuses.


Hong Kong: Uproar Over Film Censorship
LEAD: FROM REMOVING FIG LEAVES on Italian masterpieces to censoring films in Hong Kong to protecting antiquities in Israel, culture the world over provokes heated debate.


PARIS
LEAD: Paris by day and Paris by night are undergoing a subtle metamorphosis.


A TOUCH OF SOHO IN SONO
LEAD: SONO, as the renovated area of South Norwalk is called, is developing a SoHo look, reminiscent of the rejuvenated art neighborhood south of Houston Street in Manhattan, and so are its new restaurants.

Carolyn Frye Plans to Wed
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Clayton Wesley Frye Jr. of New York and New Canaan, Conn., have announced the engagement of their daughter Carolyn Ann Frye to Michael John Halloran, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Leo A. Halloran of New Canaan.


Sending Up
LEAD: Tama Janowitz's ''Adventures in Tinseltown'' was most interesting.
She has the talent of describing people and situations with clarity in a minimum of words.
Bette Midler came alive on the page, with more dimension than on the silver screen.


Honor for Bowler
LEAD: A Brooklyn-born bowler who has earned $1,207,707 since joining the Professional Bowlers Association tour in 1970, will be inducted tomorrow into the P.B.A.
Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio.
Mark Roth, who is second in career earnings by less than $60,000 to Earl Anthony, will be honored for performances that include winning 32 tour events, leading the tour in average score for five years, most recently in 1981, and being selected as P.B.A.


Talking: Taxes; Retaining Profits in a House Sale
LEAD: OLDER people who want to give up a large family home and move into something smaller are often appalled to discover that so much of the profit from the sale of their house will be lost in taxes.


Mexico: A Call for Home-Grown TV
LEAD: FROM REMOVING FIG LEAVES on Italian masterpieces to censoring films in Hong Kong to protecting antiquities in Israel, culture the world over provokes heated debate.


A SETTING FIT FOR A SHOGUN
LEAD: THE FIRST WORD I HAD OF the plan to create a new space for Japanese art at the Metropolitan Museum came three years ago from a Buddhist priest I met at the Miidera (also known as Onjoji), the imposing temple complex that overlooks Lake Biwa, east of Kyoto.
I had gone there, as I had long intended, to pay my respects at the grave of Ernest Fenollosa (1853-1908), the American scholar who did so much not only to introduce Japanese art to the West but to persuade the Japanese, then in the throes of modernization, to preserve their traditional arts.


TWO TYPES OF AUTO-FOCUSING
LEAD: EVERYONE'S talking about automatic focusing these days, and quite a few photographers think it is the greatest invention since flexible film.
But I suspect that few purchasers of auto-focus cameras know how it works, or recognize that there are several kinds of auto focusing, depending on the type and brand of camera.


DANCE: THE WENDY PERRON TROUPE
LEAD: WENDY PERRON is a quietly arresting performer who moves through a dance with a look of in-turned concentration and great physical delicacy and adroitness.
Her dances are like that, too, with a sure, sometimes fierce intelligence driving them along.
They curl into space like flowering vines, but a closer look reveals that the vines and tendrils are steely sinew.


'BIG SCREEN' TAKES ON NEW MEANING
LEAD: THE MOST VISCERALLY EXCITING, mind-expanding movies being made today - the kind that provide windows on worlds previously undreamed of, or that discover the spectacular mysteries within something as commonplace as bird-flight - aren't to be found in conventional theaters, and aren't likely to turn up in theaters soon.


Army Ratings Aim to Restore Sergeants' Authority
LEAD: The Army is testing a new system for rating the performance of sergeants in an effort to enhance their authority and prestige, according to Army officials.


Rebel Troops Give Up in Manila After One Is Killed
LEAD: The Philippine military took a tough new approach today as it quickly put down a small mutiny here led by renegade soldiers apparently loyal to former President Ferdinand E. Marcos.


Golf Round Clock
LEAD: IT'S been almost a year since Mark Matthews played 724 holes of golf in a hectic 24 hours at the Rockwood Golf Course in Fort Worth, Tex., a feat that raised $10,000 for charity last June.
Now the 25-year-old Matthews has gotten his reward.
He has been notified that his effort has been certified and accepted as a world record by the Guinness Book of World Records.


Myth Making
LEAD: If Ronald Reagan is the ''Great Communicator,'' then William Safire is certainly the ''Great Apologist.'' Rather than write what he knows to be true about the President's blundering, Mr.
Safire attacks William Casey, Donald Regan, Edwin Meese, even Nancy Reagan - anyone, in fact, but the man who is presumably in command.


Craftsman Farm
LEAD:  To the Editor:


ABOUT BOOKS
LEAD: NEW magazines usually emerge hard on the heels of a shift in life styles, despite oft-repeated warnings about the high failure rate of such publications.


Doll Sold in Boston Arouses Protest
LEAD: A bag lady doll being sold at an exclusive Boston store has stirred a protest by advocates for the homeless who say the doll is cruelly exploiting the disadvantaged for profits.


PUBLICITY, POWER AND THE POLICE
LEAD: As a representative of an organization called Victims of Police Crime who has long been uneasy with the amount of publicity intentionally generated by police unions, I would like to respond to Arthur Cliff's letter to the editor on March 22  [ ''Police Association's View on State Inquiry'' ] .

Philip Siegel of Stamford, Conn.


Getting a Patent On Animal Life
LEAD: As scientists become increasingly adept at manipulating the molecules of life, the line between the animate and the inanimate becomes ever more indistinct.


AMERICAN BASKETS DRAW PRAISE ABROAD
LEAD: ON A SMALL scale, but with a success largely unheralded outside of diplomatic circles, American crafts are finding a role as cultural ambassadors to countries with their own craft traditions.


TUNING IN TO A 'PERSIAN JOHNNY CARSON'
LEAD: IRANIANS in Southern California rarely stay up to watch Johnny Carson these days.
Instead, they get up to catch Parvis Afshar, the Iranian version of America's late-night comedian.
Each weekday morning at 7 a.m., KSCI in San Bernadino broadcasts Mr.
Afshar's ''Sima-E-Ashena,'' an hour-long Persian-language show of news, commentary and interviews.


Q &amp; A
LEAD:  CONTRACT FOR REPAIRS  Question: I recently purchased a studio in a cooperative building.
There had been previous water damage to the bathroom ceiling, but the repair job was so poor that the walls are still bumpy and crooked.
Before the closing the sponsor's selling agent signed an agreement stating that the sponsor would repair and paint the wall and ceiling by last Jan.


Michael Beatty Is Married To Linda Rudd, a Student
LEAD: Linda Joyce Rudd, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Eric Rudd of Wellesley, Mass., was married yesterday to Michael Joseph Beatty, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
Arthur Beatty of South Yarmouth, Mass.
The Rev.
Douglas Showalter performed the ceremony at the First Congregational Church in Falmouth, Mass.


DRIVING CURBS IN SEASIDE HEIGHTS
LEAD: The Seaside Heights Borough Council has enacted an ordinance forbidding motorists from driving past certain points three or more times within an hour or six or more times within any three-hour period between 9 P.M. and 4 A.M.


A New Soviet Role in Mideast?
LEAD: The Iranians have taken some wild gambles in their war with Iraq.
But even they might think twice before attacking a ship belonging to a superpower.
That is the reason why Kuwait, which supports Iraq, might hire three Soviet tankers to transport its oil through the Persian Gulf.


TURNING JAPAN INTO AN IMPORTING NATION
LEAD: AS evidenced in plummeting bond prices and soaring interest rates, the microchip war has badly shaken the international financial markets.

LAW OF THE LAND
LEAD: To the Editor: In ''Dealing With the Law of the Land'' (Travel, Feb. 15), Nicholas D. Kristof writes, ''Imposing our values on a foreign culture is less of a sin than participating in such excesses as amputation or execution by flogging.'' This kind of arrogance makes the blood of many believing Muslims boil.

By Michael Powell. (Knopf, $24.95.) The author of this intelligent and superbly written autobiography, the British film director Michael Powell, is known in this country chiefly for the cult ballet movie ''The Red Shoes'' (1948), though some consider the subtly erotic tale of Anglican nuns in the Himalayas, ''Black Narcissus'' (1947), and the benignly decadent, self-reflexive ''Peeping Tom'' (1960) even better.

NEW LIFE FOR EARLY MUSIC
LEAD: MANY RECORDINGS of pre-Classical music used to be sold in what amounted to plain brown wrappers with such plain brown titles as ''Monody, ca. 1600 - Research Period VII'' (and many, though by no means all, of the performances were monochromatic, too).
If this left little doubt about the high-mindedness attached to the whole operation, it also probably discouraged casual purchases, limiting the audience to those already in the know.


Why Not Choose One?
LEAD:  To the Editor:


Constance Casari Wed To a Fellow Journalist
LEAD: The marriage of Constance Casari, a copy editor on the cultural news desk of The New York Times, and Steven Reddicliffe, editor of the Part II feature section of New York Newsday, took place yesterday in Lincoln, Neb.

HOW TO TEST-DRIVE A NEW CAR AND DO IT RIGHT

Experiencing the feeling, smell and special allure of new cars, dealers hope, will overcome a customer's innate caution.


Cousteau at Scripps
LEAD:  To the Editor:


HOW BOTH SIDES GAIN FROM MOSCOW TALKS
LEAD: IT would be difficult enough for the Soviet Union and the United States to agree on reducing nuclear arms if their negotiators could simply lock themselves in a windowless room and deal dispassionately in the intricate calculus of complex weaponry.
But the outside world intrudes; political emotion, theatrics and imagery also have seats at the bargaining table.


THE DANCE: CUMMINGS
LEAD: BLONDELL CUMMINGS was charming, witty and poignant last Sunday afternoon when Blondell Cummings and Performers appeared at the Triplex of Manhattan Community College.
The troupe was the final attraction in a series of concerts by young choreographers associated with the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival last year.


THE FARMER AND HIS WEALTHY UNCLE
LEAD: THE United States has been blessed with a more than adequate food supply, the best and purest food supply in the world.

ON LANGUAGE
LEAD: BY NO MEANS WAS IT really teed up for him. . . .'' That phrase, teed up, was used by then-White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan in testimony before the Tower Commission.

SHOULD GRIPES AGAINST BROKERS GO TO ARBITRATION?
LEAD: From time to time, an article receives a particularly strong response from readers.
Whenever possible, we will print a large number of those letters.


MAKING 'NEWS ON THE CHEAP' PAY OFF
LEAD: IT is 8 o'clock in the morning, and the assignment editors and the producers of Cable News Network troop into the conference room for their regular morning meeting.
There are no pretensions here.
The table is too small, so some of the people grab outlying chairs and a few stand.
Those who want coffee bring their own - if they can find clean mugs.


A GUIDE TO WHERE TO STAY AND EAT IN LONDON

LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
LEAD: 'PAPA' AND THE BABY BOAS HERBERT D. HERMSDORF recently became a father.
Well, not technically, the Longwood High School earth science teacher admits. ''But everyone's calling me 'papa,' '' he said.


LONDON ON A PEDESTAL
LEAD: When I first saw the view from my office in London, I felt as if I had inherited a great painting, and in a sense, I had.
For when I look south across a sweeping bend of the Thames, I can see the New Palace of Westminister, home of the Houses of Parliament - a filigreed Gothic ramble marked at one end by soaring Victoria Tower and at the other by the familiar Clock Tower of Big Ben.


Banning Liquor During Workday
LEAD: A NEW clause in labor contracts was announced in Worcester, Mass.: the dry workday.

Verbatim; What Good Is Jail?
LEAD: ' After spending my life in the city, including 20 years in police, I say what the hell good is jail?

And that's all we get. '  - Richard J. Koehler, New York City Correction Commissioner, discussing the city's overcrowded prisons.


GOULD AND THE CD: MADE FOR EACH OTHER
LEAD: GLENN GOULD WOULD probably have loved the compact disk.

INSIDE
LEAD: Japanese Calm Over Tariffs  Japanese are voicing little fear that the American tariffs will touch off a trade war or fundamentally harm the countries' close relations.
Page 11.


Gooden Case: Sharing Blame
LEAD: During the last two weeks members of the New York news media have shown me their true colors.
While reading the various headlines, I wasn't sure if Gooden was a mass murderer, a key witness in the Iran-Contra affair, or a celebrated AIDS patient.
Whatever the case, the Big Apple's journalists have turned their pens on the Doctor: spewing venom rather than ink.


Q/and A
LEAD:  Europe by Ship  Question:Do you have information on the Polish liner Batory which sails from Montreal to Poland? - J. N., Hudson, Fla.
Answer:Passengers who want to cross the Atlantic on the Stefan Batory had better do so this year.

FLUID MATH MADE SIMPLE - SORT OF
LEAD: OF all the hard problems occupying the world's supercomputers, one heads the list: calculating the flow of fluids.


COULD VEBLEN EXPLAIN TODAY'S OPERA?
LEAD: CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION is nothing new at the Metropolitan Opera, which was founded, after all, as an amusement of New York's leisure class and until well into this century was almost entirely funded by a handful of bankers and other barons of business.
In that dim past, the show of wealth was most evident not onstage, but in a select sector of the audience where the instinct to display fine feathers was as strong as any peacock's.


SHOULD GRIPES AGAINST BROKERS GO TO ARBITRATION?
LEAD: From time to time, an article receives a particularly strong response from readers.

CONNECTICUT GUIDE
LEAD: GOLDEN EGGS...


Armchair Shopping For Homes
LEAD: ROY and Cathy Lloyd's three-level town house in Alexandria, Va., was shown on Washington's Channel 7 one chilly Sunday morning in January.
That afternoon, 24 people trekked through the Lloyds' two-bedroom home during an open house that had been promoted on the television program that morning.
On Monday, more prospective buyers came to look and on Tuesday, a few more trickled in.


Gooden Case: Sharing Blame
LEAD: I am writing to protest some of Dave Anderson's remarks in his column on Dwight Gooden (''Now Mets Know About Gooden,'' The New York Times, April 2).
Mr.
Anderson asks, ''Has cocaine forever changed his body chemistry that created that spectacular 24-4 season?'' and then engages in a good deal of speculation on that question.


MISTAKE ON RELEASE STIRS NEW JAIL DEBATE
LEAD: THE jail-population problem in Nassau County, which has bounced in and out of the Federal courts as well as political arenas since 1981, came to the fore again last week when it was learned that 16 prisoners, convicted of felony charges, were inadvertently freed as part of a Federal court-mandated early release program.


ALLANTE HAS A LOT TO SAY
LEAD: MORNINGS, I am not good.
But sometimes you do have to get up to meet a worthy adversary, in this case the dentist.
So I growled and grumbled in my empty house, and then I went out to the car, which nearly spoiled the whole day.
The car said, ''Good morning.''


FULL COATS GLOW IN APRIL SHOWERS
LEAD: AS usual, April has brought its share of rainy, windy days.
But the gloom of the weather has been offset by the fresh array of voluminous, richly colored raincoats that women are wearing, most of them every bit as breezy as the elements.


RECIPES TO KEEP IN HAND FOR THOSE TASTY ASPARAGUS SPEARS
LEAD: IN April and May asparagus is cheap and plentiful.
It comes in many sizes, from thin as a pencil to almost as thick as sugar cane.
All sizes are good - whether you like your asparagus served hot with melted butter and lemon juice or cold with a vinaigrette.
But after awhile, I like to be more adventurous, and serve asparagus with a puree of red peppers sprinkled with fresh tarragon or, as the Italians do, with Parmesan cheese and baked in a hot oven.


New York Car Exhaust Test Assailed as Ineffective and Hampered by Fraud
LEAD: Despite repeated warnings from Federal environmental officials, New York State's system for testing car emissions remains one of the most ineffective in the nation and in some cases is hampered by fraud, according to Government documents and interviews with Federal and state officials.


Debate Silenced In South Korea
LEAD: President Chun Doo Hwan of South Korea had a simple solution to the conflict over how to select a leader to replace him: He suspended the debate over constitutional changes that would decide the issue.

LEAD: Lisa Caroline Ulrich, a financial analyst at Paine Webber, and Christopher Kellogg Stout, a banking officer at Chemical Bank, are planning an October wedding.

Mr.
Stout's parents are Mr.


Faith, and Freedom
LEAD: Holy Week: the week of Easter, and also of Passover, a week to think of renewal and freedom, as good a week as there is to believe anew that faith can move mountains.
In a cathedral in Cape Town and in a mansion in Moscow, people gathered for religious services seemed to believe it.


PARK SERVICE ENDORCES PLAN TO PROTECT 3 RIVERS
LEAD: IN a reversal of its position last year, the National Park Service has endorsed a plan to federally protect three South Jersey rivers, but an agency official says the state should pay for a study of the pristine environment.


'GREAT MOMENTS,' REMEMBERED FONDLY
LEAD: I write to express my full enjoyment of the Long Island Opinion Page Article ''Great Moments (Well, Almost) in L.I.
History''  [ March 22 ] .
It was a delightful spoof of the Constitution, history and Long Islanders, with special emphasis on their high opinion of themselves - not fully deserved in many cases.


LAW OF THE LAND
LEAD: To the Editor: To what purpose did Nicholas D. Kristof write ''Dealing with the Laws of the Land''?
I was surprised that someone who lives abroad would come to such an immature view of respect for the law (and therefore culture) of another country while traveling.
The gist of the article seemed to be that the victim of a crime should have remorse for having a thief proseuted under the legal system under which he (the thief) lives.


Uncertainties of a Chemical-Filled World Bring Fear to a Suburb of Denver
LEAD: Parents in the suburb of Friendly Hills here believe toxic chemicals from a nearby aerospace complex entered their drinking water, causing sickness and death among their children.
But state and Federal Government agencies say they have found no evidence of unusual health problems in the area.


IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD: To non-weavers, the term interlacing sounds a bit cryptic.
The noted textile designer Jack Lenor Larsen and the writer Betty Freudenheim unravel it in INTERLACING: The Elemental Fabric (Kodansha International, $60), a richly illustrated volume that, in contrast to so many books on design, has a distinctly anthropological bent.


Tougher Line Is Urged in Sri Lanka After Attack
LEAD: Sinhalese groups called on the Government today to take a tougher line against Tamil terrorism, a day after 126 people were killed in a guerrilla attack.


NOTED WITH PLEASURE
LEAD:  REVOLUTION AS ILLICIT LOVE  Sometimes a writer exhilarates us with the sheer voluptuousness of his imagination.
Ronald Paulson sees the female figure of Liberty in the art of the French Revolution as combining Venus, a virgin state, a charitable woman, a sentimental love object and the mother of the new order.


Miss Kemble To Be Bride
LEAD: Announcement has been made by William Kemble of Bedford Hills, N.Y., of the engagement of his daughter, Susan Bayard Kemble, to George Patterson West of Findlay, Ohio, a son of the late Mr. and Mrs.

NASSAU SHOULD SET THE RULES
LEAD: NASSAU COUNTY is enjoying one of the strongest economic periods in its history.
Jobs are plentiful, salaries are among the highest in the nation and business is booming.

Panama Refuses Accused Nazi
LEAD: Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d tried unsuccessfully last week to help find a home for a 67-year-old Long Island land surveyor accused of Nazi war crimes.


TAILORING THE DATA BSE TO THE DATA
LEAD: TWO years ago, a data base management program called Reflex was released, and I was rather taken by it.
First of all, it was easy to use, and I'm certain that far more software is bought than is ever used, quite simply because learning how to run it is an overwhelming task.
But I also liked the program because it surpassed the usual data base manager in its ability to manipulate and analyze the information that it stored.


Two Russian Guards Killed by Guerrillas Near Afghan Border
LEAD: Afghan guerrillas attacked an outpost of Soviet border guards last week and killed two of them, the official press agency Tass said today.


Panny Thomas to Become the Bride of Mac King

High School to Close at 106
LEAD: The 106-year-old St.
Mary's Seminary, a Roman Catholic high school, will close after graduation on June 13.
The Very Rev.
Edward Gilbert, provincial of the Baltimore Province of the Redempterist Fathers, which operates the school, said this week that declining enrollment was a major factor.


AFFORDABLE HOUSING: THE 'DENSITY' FACTOR
LEAD: The article headed ''Zoning Is Vital to Quality of Life''  [ Opinion Page, March 15 ] , written in answer to Bishop John McGann's fine pastoral letter, is typical of the sophistry commonly offered in opposition to affordable housing.
Density is fast becoming a code word for justifying exclusionary zoning practices.


In the Region: Connecticut and Westchester; Hartford's Getting a World Trade Center

HOW BIG A PROBLEM IS RACISM IS SPORTS?
LEAD: Forty years ago, Jackie Robinson became the first black man to play major league baseball.
However, the struggle for racial equality and equal opportunity in professional sports is obviously far from being complete.
The lack of administrative and managerial opportunities for racial minorities is indeed a sad commentary on our nation's commitment to equality and opportunity for all.


LEARNING NATURE'S HARMONY
LEAD: NATURE is impressive this time of year.
Brown patches in the backyard take on a greenish hue, and trees that only months before were barren, angular silhouettes against the gray horizon suddenly explode into patchworks of colors and shapes.
Beautiful shapes that emit beautiful sounds.

MAKING OLD WOOD NEW AGAIN WITH CHEMICAL PAINT STRIPPER
LEAD: STRIPPING paint or varnish from a valued piece of wood furniture is a time-consuming, tedious job no matter what method is used.
However, in many cases it is the only way to restore the original beauty of the natural wood, and it is an essential preparatory step before you can stain or bleach the wood.


SCHEDULE PUTS KNICKS OUT OF THEIR MISERY
LEAD: In theory, the Knicks' miserable season ended a while ago - sometime after the inevitable dismissal of Hubie Brown as coach last December and before the incessant string of injuries made each contest an unpredictable adventure.
And yet, in truth, the misery didn't end until tonight, when the Knicks lost to the Cleveland


Dr. Cortes Plans To Marry June 20
LEAD: Dr.

David Gaudino, a surgical resident at the St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.


KNOWING NO BOUNDARY
LEAD: CAN A FRENCH chef find fulfillment cooking with Asian ingredients in an Italian restaurant?
Jacky Robert can.
He calls his experiment in culinary cross-pollination the ''cuisine of tomorrow,'' but at San Francisco's venerable Amelio's, Robert's culinary internationalism is very much of the here and now.

A PROPHET HONORED AT LAST IN HIS OWN LAND
LEAD: SURELY NO ARCHITECT IS quite so much a prophet without honor in his own land as James Stirling, an artist of extraordinary inventive power who has had almost nothing to do in his native England for more than a decade.
Mr.
Stirling, who won the gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1980 and the Pritzker Prize, often called architecture's Nobel, in 1981, had sat in London designing museums for Germany, civic buildings for Italy and academic buildings for the United States, and as his reputation had grown greater and greater around the world the absence of a major recent


Report Cites Tunnel Agents' Health Risks
LEAD: Male tunnel officers with at least 10 years' experience were 88 percent more likely to die from heart disease than men in the general public, apparently due to carbon monoxide exposure, according to a Federal report.


Broadcast TV
LEAD: ''Three by Three,'' which will be shown on Friday night at 9 on Channel 13, is the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater at its most eclectic.
Mr.
Ailey's ''Blues Suite'' and Donald McKayle's ''Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder'' are fine old repertory works - and American modern dance classics - in the company's distinctive dance-theater style.


Perspectives: Low-Rise Innovation; Staten Island Project Is Back on Track
LEAD: EIGHT years have passed since a developer succeeded in getting a plan for a 210-unit town-house development in the Arlington section of Staten Island through the city's reviewing agencies.


Preserving a Rural Haven
LEAD: The Adirondacks are sometimes called the ''lungs of New York,'' by Manhattanites fleeing city pollution.

Facts on File Publications. 226 pages. $16.95.


LAW OF THE LAND
LEAD: To the Editor: Reading ''Dealing With the Laws of the Land'' served to remind me why Americans are viewed as they are around the world and particularly in Central and South America and the Middle East.
Mr.
Kristof's Victim as Apologist must seem hysterical to local authorities, reinforcing the arrogant but essentially spineless stereotype that their governments and media tout.


THE WINNERS WHO CAME FROM BEHIND
LEAD: WHEN world championships are instituted, American selection procedures tend to be haphazard.
In 1937 Ely Culbertson selected his own team to play in Budapest, and the United States women's team arrived with just three players.
In 1960 the first American women's team in a Team Olympiad included a player who had never before played with any of her teammates.

DECIDING CONSEQUENCES OF INSANITY DEFENSE

NO EX-OFFICIALS AS COUNTY CONSULTANTS
LEAD: I read, with great interest, your article ''Gibbs Sets Out on His Last Career'' (March 29).
Like many others who have worked with Mr.  [ Edward M. ]  Gibbs, I regret that the deputy county executive has decided to retire.
Mr.
Gibbs was a good deputy and before that he was a dedicated legislator.


AVOIDING THE FOOT-IN-MOUTH SYNDROME
LEAD: STORIES abound about the ways American companies have messed up when they advertised to foreign audiences. ''Finger lickin' good,'' Kentucky Fried Chicken's slogan, once came out as ''eat your fingers off'' in Chinese.
And many Asians interpreted Pepsi's ''come alive generation'' as a call to bring back the dead.


Argentina Seeks Peaceful End to Military Rebellion
LEAD: Rebel soldiers outside a military school they held near Buenos Aires being taunted by civilians.

The incident occurred at 8:30 P.M.


MAKING OLD WOOD NEW AGAIN WITH CHEMICAL PAINT STRIPPER
LEAD: STRIPPING paint or varnish from a valued piece of wood furniture is a time-consuming, tedious job no matter what method is used.
However, in many cases it is the only way to restore the original beauty of the natural wood, and it is an essential preparatory step before you can stain or bleach the wood.


TREBELHORN OF THE BREWERS: A NAME TO NOTE, FOR NOW
LEAD: TOM TREBELHORN never quite made a name for himself during an unspectacular minor league career spent primarily in the Northwest League towns of Bend, Ore.; Walla Walla, Wash., and Lewiston, Idaho.
His name wasn't generally known either when he became a major league manager last September.
Now, though, his team is making him known.


DANCE: ACANTHUS BALLET
LEAD: THE Acanthus Ballet is a group of likable young dancers who presented a likable program of dance on Friday at the Field, a performance space at the Pineapple Dance Center on Houston Street.
Highlights were ''Garnets,'' a new work by Richard Allan Ploch, the director of Acanthus, and ''Ives' Scene America,'' by Robert


GASOLINE TAX RISE: PRESSURE INCREASING
LEAD: PROPONENTS of a 5-cent increase in the state gasoline tax to finance a renewal of the Transportation Trust Fund are stepping up their efforts to get the tax passed before the present trust fund goes dry in July.

LEAD: Mrs.
Eustis Walcott of Boston and David S. Dickenson of Cleveland have announced the engagement of their daughter Martha Stuart Dickenson to Timothy Edward Heath, a son of Ann O. Heath of Newport, R.I., and Richard O. Heath of New Canaan, Conn.

Theodore J. Ross of Tiburon, Calif.
An August wedding is planned.


THE HOT HISTORY DEPARTMENT
LEAD: A GOOD PORTION OF THE PRINCETON HISTORY department usually turns up on Friday mornings in the seminar room deep in the bowels of the Firestone Library.
But one Friday last October, the place was jammed and the air was alive with anticipation.
Jean-Christophe Agnew, a Yale professor, had ventured into the weekly Shelby Cullom Davis Seminar, a lion's den in which many a historian has been torn apart, to question the very concept that has made the

After Fatal Fire, Youths Rethink Life
LEAD: In the elevators and upper floors of 1295 Fifth Avenue, a smoky smell lingers and the ceilings remain blackened.
On the 33d and 34th floors, the doors leading to the apartments of the seven people who died in a fire there last month stand burned beyond use.
A bouquet of dried, shriveled flowers is taped beside each door.

Soviet Union: New Ventures Sprout in Cultural Thaw
LEAD: FROM REMOVING FIG LEAVES on Italian masterpieces to censoring films in Hong Kong to protecting antiquities in Israel, culture the world over provokes heated debate.


JAZZ: 'DYNAMIC DUOS' PLAY IN N.Y.U. PROGRAM
LEAD: THE ''Dynamic Duos'' that were featured in the ''Highlights in Jazz'' program on Thursday evening at the N.Y.U.
Loeb Student Center were, in the words of Jack Kleinsinger, host of the series, ''cooking on a low flame.''


House Speaker, in Soviet, Finds New Freedom There
LEAD: The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Jim Wright of Texas, said on Soviet television today that the United States and the Soviet Union ''have a common purpose, and the common purpose is peace.''


Sending Up
LEAD: Tama Janowitz managed to do the impossible: have a bad time in Los Angeles and obtain a non-interview from Bette Midler (''Adventures in Tinseltown,'' March 22).
Ms.
Janowitz then wrote about her non-adventures and -most astonishing of all - The Times Magazine ran it.


QUOTATION OF THE DAY
LEAD: ''Costa Rica chose butter over guns a long time ago.
In Central America it would be much better to spend money on economic development or education instead of guns.
It is so clear, but nobody does it.''  - President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica.  [ 16:6. ]


AN EASTER PARADE IN THE NEW WORLD
LEAD: WHITE bunnies, real or fluffy velour.
Painted hard-boiled eggs, or tiny chocolate ones wrapped in colored foil.
They always remind me of this special holiday time.


Carla Pellegrino, Personnel Director, Is Fiancee of Carlton Penavera-Cabot
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Peter Pellegrino of North Andover and Osterville, Mass., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Carla Anne Pellegrino, to Carlton Penavera-Cabot, a son of Mrs.

The TV Evangelists Thrive on Skepticism; Old-Time Folk Religion
LEAD:  To the Editor:


THE THIRD DEGREE AT THE BORDER
LEAD: Some people collect restaurant menus on their travels; others keep Kaopectate bottles labeled in French, in German, in Spanish, in Hindi: a record of successive and sudden onslaughts of bodily distress.
Still other travelers clutter their living rooms with Indian brasses or Provencal pottery or Fijian tapa cloths.


BATTLE LINE ON GRAFFITI IS SHIFTING
LEAD: New York seems to be winning its war against graffiti in the subways, but many of the graffiti writers are using their spray cans and brushes on alternate targets: bridges, buildings, playgrounds and, particularly, the equipment of the Department of Sanitation.


TRAVEL ADVISORY
LEAD:  MAJOR ROAD IN MEXICO BEING WIDENED


A SEARCH FOR SERVICES FOR HANDICAPPED BOY
LEAD: The article in your March 22, 1987, issue, ''Expense Rising for Education of Disabled,'' leaves the reader with the impression that Westchester County provides an abundance of expensive services to the preschool, handicapped population.
I am a parent of an 18-month-old boy with Down's Syndrome and was astounded to find that I was unable to secure county-funded services for him until he was 12 months old.


SWEDEN SHARES ITS FRENCH RICHES
LEAD: THIS YEAR MARKS THE 10TH AN-niversary of the founding of the Drawing Center, now at 35 Wooster Street in SoHo.
Some form of celebration was clearly desirable, and it is our good fortune that the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm agreed to send over an exhibition called ''The Art of Drawing in France 1400-1900.


ABUNDANT OFFERINGS OF PIANO AND VOICE
LEAD: THERE'S something for everyone on this week's music calendar, but if your tastes run to vocal and piano performances, the choices are especially abundant.


HOW BIG A PROBLEM IS RACISM IS SPORTS?
LEAD: The question is really ''How big a problem is racism in the nation?'' Sports mirrors the larger society.
The presence of the Abdul-Jabbars, Robinsons and Strawberrys in sports, as well as black superstars in other fields, may give one the impression that racism is a dying monster, but it is not.
The monster changes form but does not die.


'Poorest of the Poor' Are the Target of Welfare Society Grants
LEAD: New York's oldest family welfare organization, the Community Service Society, is searching for neighborhood groups to help spend $2.7 million for ''the poorest of the poor.''


SHOULD GRIPES AGAINST BROKERS GO TO ARBITRATION?
LEAD: From time to time, an article receives a particularly strong response from readers.
Whenever possible, we will print a large number of those letters.


IN THE MIDST OF PLENTY, PLENTY IS MISSING
LEAD: SOMETHING CURIOUS and paradoxical has happened in the New York museum scene.


Part and Parcel
LEAD: On the grounds of the rambling suburban estates that burgeoned around the turn-of-the century, the outbuildings were, more often than not, designed in styles similar to the grander main house.
As a growing number of these estates are now being subdivided into more managable packages of land, many of the utilitarian structures - like barns, grain houses, stables and chicken coops - have been renovated to become main houses themselves.


Kenneth W. Kaufman To Wed Laura Thrall
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Oliver J. Thrall 2d of Windsor, Conn., have annnounced the engagement of their daughter Laura Elizabeth Thrall to Kenneth William Kaufman, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
William E. Kaufman of Armonk, N.Y.
A September wedding is planned.


Sanibel Island
LEAD: To the Editor: In the article on Sanibel Island (Travel, March 8) the author states that Cross Creek, the settlement Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings made famous in her writings, is ''nearby'' the Everglades.
That's roughly equivalent to saying, in terms of mileage, that Washington, D.C., is nearby to New York.


Patricia M. Mulry Engaged to Douglas D. Morgan
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas C. Mulry of Locust Valley, L.I., have announced the engagement of their daughter Patricia Mary Mulry to Douglas Dane Morgan, a son of Jeanette Philipp Morgan of Scottsdale, Ariz., and the late Lacy L. Morgan.
The wedding is to be in June.


NEW YORKERS, ETC.
LEAD: A COUPLE of years ago a young man was given what he considers a major gift: a friend introduced him to the Conservatory Garden, a quiet, symmetrical oasis in the upper reaches of Central Park.


A GUITARIST, A FLUTIST, A PIANIST AND A SINGER APPEAR IN NEW YORK RECITALS
LEAD:  Baltazar Benitez


'LES MISERABLES': THE DISTINCTIVE AND STIRRING VERSION IS STILL VICTOR HUGO'S
LEAD: THERE WERE PEOPLE who told me ''Les Miserables'' was going to be wonderful and people who told me it was going to be terrible.
The truth - or my reactions, at least - turned out to lie somewhere in the middle.
If the lyrics were often little more than doggerel, and if the score often seemed the musical equivalent of doggerel, there were compensations in Colm Wilkinson's rightly acclaimed Jean Valjean, in a few of the supporting performances, in the scenery and lighting, and, every now and then, in a genuinely striking dramatic effect.


MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION: A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY
LEAD: STANLEY GULKIN, A TRIM, FIERCELY energetic man in his late 40's, is a tax and corporate lawyer who has, he says, ''worked very hard and done very well.'' At his office in Livingston, N.J., he gets 50 phone calls a day. ''You get pulled in all directions - this is success!
It makes me feel important.

CONCERT: INDIANA GROUP PERFORMS EARLY MUSIC
LEAD: THE performance of early music on period instruments is assuming an ever-larger part of our music conservatories' activities.
Indiana University has long been involved in this field, and on Wednesday the large and accomplished Baroque Orchestra of the university's Early Music Institute appeared at Merkin Concert


Trinity's Bridge
LEAD: There was a time when Trinity Place in lower Manhattan was so serene and empty on weekends that ''you could bowl down it,'' said Kenneth A. Ellis, a spokesman for Trinity Church, a city landmark on Broadway at the head of Wall Street.
But traffic has mounted along this narrow street that separates the rear of the church from its parish office tower.


LAW OF THE LAND
LEAD: To the Editor: Mr.
Kristof's piece on criminal justice in foreign lands claims foreign visitors bring with them their ''mental baggage'' of justice standards to be appplied to the host country, to the point where it may justify intervention in the enforcement of a Draconian sanction.
He raises a host of issues that all people traveling abroad, especially to countries with considerably different cultural and/or economic circumstances from his own, should contemplate.


Border Officers To Weigh Pleas Of Illegal Aliens
LEAD: The Government has named Border Patrol agents, investigators, deportation officers and other enforcement personnel to review applications from illegal aliens seeking legal status under the new immigration law.

IT'S TIME TO CONSIDER A KEOGH - FOR '87
LEAD: IF you are a self-employed professional, or a homemaker or salaried worker with a sideline business, a Keogh plan is one of the most attractive ways to accumulate money for retirement.
Similar in concept to a corporate retirement or profit-sharing plan, a Keogh plan allows you to make tax-deductible annual contributions to it, and the earnings accumulate tax-free until they are withdrawn at retirement.


SUBWAY DOOR PROBLEM NO OPEN AND SHUT CASE
LEAD: AT 3:55 P.M. on April 9, a southbound J train left the Chambers Street station in Manhattan with one door open.


WIDER RENT PROGRAM FOR THE AGED URGED
LEAD: TO the city, the program has meant creation of another layer of bureaucracy and the loss of millions of dollars in taxes each year.
To landlords, it has meant paperwork and sometimes frustrating waits for reimbursement of forgone rent payments.


LOST SEASON FOR NETS FOLLOWED BIG HOPES
LEAD: It has been this kind of season for the Nets: In the Detroit airport last week, Coach Dave Wohl leaned against a barrier and inadvertently set off the security-alarm system.


AT A 'REBELLIOUS' DUTCH ABBEY, EASTER FOR ALL
LEAD: A bright pile of yellow flowers, fresh cut from this nation's spring treasure of blossoming fields, was all that punctuated the Good Friday hush when Jesus was pronounced dead once more in the church of Berne Abbey.


PAX SYRIANA UNFOLDS UNDER CLOSE SCRUNITY IN LEBANON
LEAD: IT is as if the Syrians had never left.
Soldiers dressed in red uniforms and steel helmets man checkpoints built of bricks and sandbags in most streets of mainly Moslem West Beirut.
Foot patrols armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades provide an imposing presence long lacking in this lawless city.


12 Die on Jordan School Bus
LEAD: Twelve passengers on a school bus were killed and 22 were injured when the bus overturned during an outing in the Mujib Valley, the official Jordanian press agency said today.
The victims of the accident Friday were teachers and students of a boys' secondary school in Dhiban, 30 miles south of Amman.


Gooden Case: Sharing Blame
LEAD: A few thoughts concerning Dwight Gooden. 1.
The Mets' organization should be rebuked for letting a gem become tarnished. 2.
Davey Johnson, the manager, should be dismissed - or at least given a stern reprimand - for being blind to the plight of his star pitcher.
It's impossible to believe that he was looking when Gooden was having pitching problems.


GOVERNOR CUOMO VS. THE LEGISLATORS
LEAD: Here is how Governor Cuomo has attacked, and legislators have defended, the ethics bill approved overwhelmingly by both houses but vetoed last week by the Governor.
The bill would have restricted the activities of legislators, legislative employees and all state employees in policy-making positions.


TEXACO'S CHAPTER 11 THWARTS PENNZOIL
LEAD: Texaco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in a move intended to keep Pennzoil from seizing any assets.
Facing a court decision that it must post a $12 billion bond as it appeals a jury award to Pennzoil for interfering with Pennzoil's deal to buy Getty, Texaco said it had no choice after Pennzoil rejected a $2 billion settlement offer.


CORRECTION
LEAD: Because of a production error, some copies of the Real Estate section today omitted the continuation from the first page of an article about comparing rents with incomes, and carried the Northeast Notebook twice.
Readers wishing copies of the continuation of the article may write to Production Quality Control, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y.


Don't Mess With the Easter Bunny
LEAD: Alex Ramirez being kept by his mother, Alma, from tweaking the nose of the large white rabbit handing out baskets yesterday at the Easter egg hunt in Weehawken, N.J.

LEAD: Announcement has been made by Frieda Smith Odom of Myrtle Beach, S.C., of the engagement of her daughter Montie Marion Mills to Mark Sherman Perry, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
John S. Perry of Avon, Conn., and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
The wedding is to be May 30.


Myth Making
LEAD: William Safire incorrectly asserts that the letter sent recently to The Wall Street Journal over my signature was in fact written by former President Nixon.
Though much of the factual material was drawn from Mr.
Nixon's excellent memoirs, every word of the letter was mine.
But, while I don't imagine Mr.


Help From Friends
LEAD: IT'S not easy for a 37-year-old to score 38 points, even in an emotional farewell appearance, but Julius Erving of the 76ers had a lot of help from his teammates Friday night as he became only the third player in National Basketball Association history to reach the 30,000-point mark.
Erving, playing his last regular-season home game, got 2 more points than he needed in the game against the Indiana Pacers, bringing his career total to 30,002 and putting him in the company of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has 36,374, and Wilt


HOW BIG A PROBLEM IS RACISM IS SPORTS?
LEAD: You'll hear plenty about the dearth of black managers and executives, but let's not forget that there is also still bias in fielding teams.
If many black athletes are superstars, then many must also be excellent or good journeyman players.
But at the journeyman level, blacks are often not well represented, as they should be if skill were all that mattered.


RECIPES TO KEEP IN HAND FOR THOSE TASTY ASPARAGUS SPEARS
LEAD: IN April and May asparagus is cheap and plentiful.
It comes in many sizes, from thin as a pencil to almost as thick as sugar cane.
All sizes are good - whether you like your asparagus served hot with melted butter and lemon juice or cold with a vinaigrette.
But after awhile, I like to be more adventurous, and serve asparagus with a puree of red peppers sprinkled with fresh tarragon or, as the Italians do, with Parmesan cheese and baked in a hot oven.


Ranks of Volunteer Firefighters Thinned by Changing Society
LEAD: When a 100-year-old farmhouse caught fire recently on a secluded hill over Lake Louise, the siren in this township's fire hall wailed its melancholy summons.
But the five men who responded were too little and too late.
By the time reinforcements from nearby departments arrived, flames had consumed the house, leaving little more than charred beams and rubble.


Dr. Forrest Is to Marry James Litzow, a Student
LEAD: The engagement of Dr.
J.Kim Forrest to James Litzow, a son of Dr. and Mrs.
John Litzow of Elmgrove, Wis., has been announced by the future bride's parents, Silvi Forrest of New York and Mel Forrest of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

A SIMPLE EFFORT WILL CONTROL THE WEEDS
LEAD: IF the grass is about three inches tall, start the mowing ritual; be sure cutting blades are sharp and the motor is in good condition.
Forsythia in bloom signals application of pre-emergent weed controls to prevent crabgrass and other aggressive lawn weeds from sprouting; also use this form of weed control on service areas and flower borders to prevent nuisance weeds from growing this summer.


STOCK-CAR DRIVERS CHASING EARNHARDT
LEAD: The Winston Cup stock-car racers have this weekend off, giving them time to think about one thing: how to catch Dale Earnhardt.


A DEADLINE PASSES: SUPERFUND CREEPS SLOWLY TOWARD CLEANUP GOALS
LEAD: UNDER the law Congress passed nearly seven years ago to protect the public and the environment from the dangers of abandoned toxic waste dumps, a grand total of 13 sites have been completely cleaned up.
Considering that there are tens of thousands of such dumps around the country, perhaps 20,000 of them seriously contaminated, the record can hardly be called impressive.


ISLANERS, CAPITALS IN THIRD OVERTIME
LEAD: It seemed like it would take forever to decide which team would face the Philadelphia Flyers for the division championship, and in what would definitely be the longest game in either team's history, the Islanders and Capitals went into the third overtime tonight tied, 2-2.


MODEL TRAINS: NOT JUST TOYS
LEAD: MORE THAN 250 PEO-ple traveled from throughout Europe and the United States to Lausanne, Switzerland, two years ago to celebrate the 70th birthday of Count Antonio Giansanti Coluzzi - and to play with his model trains.


DAVIS AND REDS SMASH ASTROS, 8-0
LEAD: Bill Gullickson pitched a four-hitter, and Eric Davis drove in three runs with a home run off Nolan Ryan and a triple as the Cincinnati Reds beat the Houston Astros today, 8-0.


No Headline
LEAD: Dick Shawn, the comic actor who played Hitler in the Mel Brooks movie ''The Producers,'' died Friday night after collapsing in front of an audience that at first thought the fall was a joke.

HAWKS FULFILING TALL ORDER
LEAD: WHEN Mike Fratello - who says he is 5 feet 7 inches (though in a pinch could probably pass for 5-6), and is short enough to have once been turned down for a National Basketball Association head coach's job because of his height - when Mike Fratello, now the coach of the Atlanta Hawks, stands next to Tree Rollins or Kevin


COLLECTING WITH A TOUCH OF GLASS
LEAD: IT is fragile, durable, decorative and practical - and part of America's past.
It may be found in junk shops, encased in museums or sparkling on living-room shelves.
Depending upon one's point of view, glass is something to break and replace or to collect and cherish.

LEAD: Testimony in the trial lasted a rancorous nine weeks, with four black journalists accusing the management of The Daily News of racism and The News accusing them of incompetence.
Last week the jury agreed with the journalists.


RECITAL: JOSEPH SMITH
LEAD: IN an art that has come to equate importance with size, Joseph Smith is an attractively reticent pianist.
Playing at Alice Tully Hall on Wednesday night, Mr.
Smith made Beethoven's early F minor Sonata a model of Classical grammar, managing to be expressive without ever inflating a relatively contained format beyond its natural boundaries.


Life With Trixie
LEAD: TRIXIE IS NOT THE FIRST dog I had after I became an adult, or even the second.
I got the first one almost 15 years ago, and named her Mary.
She was a gray-furred, blue-eyed Weimaraner.
She fell asleep by sucking my thumb until she nodded off.
From the day my girlfriend and I carried her from San Francisco to Santa Cruz in a napkin, Mary lived with me - for 10 years.


IN HUNTINGTON, A BOSSA NOVA BEAT

You don't have to drive it 132 miles per hour, but it is nice to know that you could, Saab says about its new 9000 model.

Golden Gate's 50th Birthday Party Is Rescued
LEAD: It seemed so simple a year ago: a party to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Golden Gate Bridge, the best-known Western gateway to the nation.
It would be a $21.9 million civic party, community leaders promised, rivaling the centennial of the Statue of Liberty.


Brown-Bagging It
LEAD: THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND MAY rely on a retinue to carry her impedimenta, but the rest of the world's women must tote the works themselves.
For many women, the tote bag is an office away from the desk, a portable dressing table, a locker room, lunch pail, library, shopping cart, travel bag or an amalgam of all these.

LEAD: Mrs.

WHO IS TO SAY WHAT'S RIGHT INTEACHING ETHICS?
LEAD: It's hard to find anyone these days who opposes the teaching of values in the public schools.
Politicians from President Reagan to Governor Cuomo have made an issue of it, while many educators have repudiated ''values clarification,'' a theory fashionable in the 1960's and 70's that held that teachers should not tell children the difference between right and wrong.

Parties With a Purpose
LEAD:  Roman Celebration  April 20 - The American Academy in Rome, in a magnificent Italian Renaissance mansion, has fostered some of the most illustrious talents in American arts and letters since its founding in 1894 as a center for advanced studies.

DELAWARE JOINS 3 STATES IN BIG LOTTERY
LEAD: Twice a week, on Wednesday and Friday, Ike Williams leaves his job in Delaware and drives 21 miles to Jayco Liquors in this border town.

Instead, like thousands of other Delaware residents hoping to strike it rich, he comes here to buy Maryland lottery tickets.


Spies I Have Known

Gary P. Wormser, is about to be published.


NEW PERSPECTIVES ON MUSICAL THEATER
LEAD: QUESTION: How many of the current Broadway season's new American musicals are still running?
ANSWER:


INFINITY IS BIGGER THAN ALL OF US
LEAD: IN ''Past Tense,'' the first volume of his diaries, Jean Cocteau says that ''Gide has never experienced the discomfort of infinity.'' It's a rather catty remark, but it rings true.
It reminds me of a photograph I saw of Gide: he was at the opera in Paris, sitting in the orchestra, and over his beautifully domed bald head he had draped a silk scarf.


OLD RAIL ROUTES SOUGHT AS PARK TRAILS
LEAD: THE decline of rail lines in Connecticut could mean miles of new recreation trails for hikers, bikers, horseback riders and others, under a new program of the State Environmental Protection Department.

Illustrated. 273 pp.
New York: Oxford University Press. $17.95.


IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD:  BILLYBALL.
By Billy Martin with Phil Pepe. (Doubleday, $16.95.) Given the stormy reputation of its author, a former manager of the New York Yankees, this book is surprisingly mild in tone and substance.
The stated purpose of the volume is to present Billy Martin's views on managerial strategy and tactics.


THE FEW, THE RICH, PININFARINA
LEAD: IF there is one word that sets fire to the soul of a true car buff, it is the word Italian.

DAI RAKUDA KAN'S THEATER OF RAW IMAGES
LEAD: DAI RAKUDA KAN, FOUNDED and directed by Akaji Maro, was the first company to introduce Japan's Butoh dance-theater on a large scale to the United States.
It is true that earlier, Japanese dancers who had been influenced by Butoh had performed as individuals in New York.
But significantly, their work was not seen in the context of the still-unfamiliar fusion of German dance expressionism and Japanese experimentation that became

MUSIC: JUILLARD QUARTET AND HAYDN
LEAD: ONE of Haydn's most fully characteristic works - therefore unique, original and lacking ostentation - is the series of slow instrumental ''sonatas'' on the seven last words of Christ.
The cycle was composed about 1786, and later published in arrangements, including one for string quartet that the Juilliard Quartet has often performed.


Robinson's Days: Sweet Memories
LEAD:  To the Sports Editor:


MUSIC: 'PLANCTUS MARIAE'
LEAD: THE ''Planctus Mariae,'' as offered at the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine Good Friday afternoon, re-enacts the lamentations of the three Marys at the foot of Jesus's cross.
This modern version of a 14th-century church drama has been realized by W. L. Smolden and uses four players - the Virgin, Mary Jacobi, Mary Magdalen and John.


A TREE FOR WINE
LEAD: IT'S just the sort of thing that might make a serious enophile quake with trepidation: a wall-hung vertical rack from which cantilevered wine bottles protrude.
But it only looks precarious.

LEAD: The engagement of Dorothy Caeser Chanock to Robert Owen McCabe, the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Aloysius B. McCabe of Washington and Wellfleet, Mass., has been announced by Martha Johnson Caeser of New Haven, mother of the bride-to-be.

Teicher On His Role
LEAD: The New York Times Magazine recently published two articles that inaccurately and unfairly report about my role on the staff of the National Security Council.


Comings and Goings
LEAD: THE road back to the major leagues begins in Miami for the former Baltimore Oriole and Montreal Expo pitcher, Dennis Martinez.
A free agent who had a 3-6 record and a 4.59 earned-run average with the Expos last year, Martinez has signed a two-week contract with the Class A Miami Marlins in an attempt to get in shape for a possible comeback with the Expos when he becomes eligible to rejoin them May 1.


A Landmark With an Unwanted Status
LEAD: DEPENDING on your point of view, it is either an architectural mishmash or a masterful example of scientific eclecticism.
But the Methodist Church of St.
Paul and St.
Andrew on the Upper West Side, everyone agrees, has become one of New York's enduring real-estate controversies.
After landmark designation in 1981 stalled a plan to demolish most of the church at West 86th Street and West End


HOW BIG A PROBLEM IS RACISM IS SPORTS?
LEAD: We need more courageous people like Branch Rickey, people who aren't afraid to take risks.

HERR SLAMS METS IN 10TH
LEAD: On a night that will haunt their memories, the Mets blew a five-run lead in the fourth inning and a pair of one-run leads in the ninth and 10th innings tonight.
And then they blew the entire evening when Tommy Herr of the St.
Louis Cardinals whaled a grand slam off Jesse Orosco that buried the Mets once and for all, 12-8.


Candidates are Striving to Establish THE Image
LEAD: THIS is the period known as ''the invisible primary,'' the stage of the Presidential campaign when candidates run almost no television commercials and receive no votes.
It is the time for battling for staff, struggling for campaign money and skirmishing for the hearts and hands of the party activists who do the unheralded work of democracy.


In the Shadows Of Watergate
LEAD: LEGAL fallout from the Watergate scandal continued to flutter down last month, nearly 15 years after the affair began.

But nobody has praised the drama coach who gave King back his game face.


F.D.A. Finds Diluted Caffeine Lessens Danger
LEAD: Some bone defects seen in the fetuses carried by rats that had been given large amounts of caffeine appear to reverse themselves after birth, a finding scientists say may lessen concerns about effects of the stimulant on human fetuses.


The TV Evangelists Thrive on Skepticism
LEAD:  To the Editor:


FORGET FLIPPER - HERE'S THE NEWS
LEAD: CREATIVE programming used to be a foreign concept to Spanish-language television stations.
They were the only game in town, so they made do with a few crudely produced variety shows, occasional bullfights or dubbed episodes of Flipper, and anything else that Univision, the main supplier of Spanish programming, brought in from


Richmond Battles to Control Swollen James River
LEAD: National Guardsmen helped patrol the city's streets today and huge pumps that drain the James River were sandbagged to protect them as the swollen river threatened Richmond.

SAN DIEGO HAS EDGE FOR NEXT CUP RACE
LEAD: The next venue for the America's Cup could be any of at least 12 cities across the United States.
But one place has the edge - San Diego, the California city whose sailing team beat Australia for yachting's best-known trophy.


GOOD BUYS DOWN UNDER
LEAD: As Australia rises in popularity as a place for Americans to visit, the land Down Under has become -coincidentally - a better and cheaper place for shopping.
The attractive prices on Australian-made goods, which until a few years ago were not particulary valued, is a result of the Australian Labor Government's devaluation of the Australian dollar.


Patrick John Barry Plans Wedding to Mary K. Nutt
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
David Tysen Nutt of Scotch Plains, N.J., have announced the engagement of their daughter Mary Katharine Nutt to Patrick John Barry, a son of Mr. and Mrs.

MUSIC: FAYRUZ SINGS
LEAD: FAYRUZ, a singer whose music has become a symbol of Lebanese unity, performed to an adoring reception Wednesday at Avery Fisher Hall.
In the Middle East, where she has been performing for three decades, Fayruz is a superstar, appealing to Christian and Moslem audiences alike; she even appeared on a Lebanese postage stamp.


Myth Making
LEAD: In his article ''Ten Myths About the Reagan Debacle'' (March 22), I found William Safire's observations to be shrewd and surprisingly objective, as I confess to anticipating an impassioned apologia for the Reagan Administration's indefensible operational blunders.


An Older Father
LEAD: In his article ''A Fulfillment'' (About Men, March 29), Richard Taylor states, ''My thoughts are free to focus entirely on my wife and baby,'' now that he is an older father and no longer burdened with career, status, income and the many other necessities that take up our ''normal'' child-rearing years.


HOW BIG A PROBLEM IS RACISM IS SPORTS?
LEAD: Al Campanis only voiced what many others in decision-making positions in sports believe and practice.
The ''old boy'' network that can always find another assignment for a white manager with a less-than-outstanding record has historically had nothing but a deaf ear to the entreaties of the aspiring black manager.


Anne Keesee To Be Wed Next June 20
LEAD: Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas Woodfin Keesee Jr. of Mount Kisco, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Anne Hartford Keesee, to Thomas Michael Niemann, a son of Mr. and Mrs.
John Oscar Niemann of St.
Louis.


Fear and the Feerick Commission
LEAD: To win funding for his new Commission on Government Integrity from the New York Legislature, Governor Cuomo went along with the sacrifice of his choice for chairman, Joseph Califano.
That was a heavy price; Mr.
Cuomo recovers it with interest by naming John Feerick, dean of the Fordham Law School, as chairman and Cyrus Vance, former Secretary of


COMMISSION ON HOMELESS EXPLORES HOUSING OPTIONS
LEAD: WESTCHESTER is in danger of providing nothing but emergency housing for the homeless instead of building permanent, moderate-priced housing for them, the Rev.
John P. Duffell, pastor of St.
Peter's Roman Catholic Church in Yonkers, has warned the County Commission on the Homeless.


A New Measure Of Indecency
LEAD: Howard Stern, the radio morning-show host, had agreed not to say any of the seven words banned from the airwaves for the last decade.
But still the complaints came, about Mr.
Stern and about other sexually explicit programs and telephone services.
And so the Federal Communications Commission decided that seven words were not enough.


It's Better To Build
LEAD: World Airlines has been traversing the globe for 40 years, and should be ''flying over the North Atlantic for a good many more.'' So, given rising rents in Nassau County, L.I., and a 15-year lease that was on the verge of expiring, Mr.
Roney, systems and budget manager for Sabena, thought it would make sense for the company to build its North American corporate headquarters.


NEW JERSEY GUIDE

TROUBLE IN RIVER CITY, RIGHT HERE IN BEIJING

Jazz
LEAD: Oliver Jones did not undertake a full-time jazz career until 1980, when he was 46 years old.

Canada: Grants for New Talent or Established Artists?
LEAD: FROM REMOVING FIG LEAVES on Italian masterpieces to censoring films in Hong Kong to protecting antiquities in Israel, culture the world over provokes heated debate.


MAKING OLD WOOD NEW AGAIN WITH CHEMICAL PAINT STRIPPER
LEAD: STRIPPING paint or varnish from a valued piece of wood furniture is a time-consuming, tedious job no matter what method is used.
However, in many cases it is the only way to restore the original beauty of the natural wood, and it is an essential preparatory step before you can stain or bleach the wood.


'47 Footnote
LEAD:  To the Sports Editor:


IN SHORT: NONFICTION
LEAD:  MIND TOOLS: The Five Levels of Mathematical Reality.
By Rudy Rucker. (Houghton Mifflin, $17.95.) For those who gave up college mathematics for what seemed more liberal arts, Rudy Rucker's new book, ''Mind Tools,'' is a dazzling refresher course.
As in past works, like ''The Fourth Dimension,'' he rekindles the wonder that can come from contemplating logarithms, exponential curves and transcendental numbers.


HOPES FOR SATURN RETURN TO EARTH
LEAD: IT is perhaps the most famous car never sold.
The first commercial Saturn, General Motors's high-technology gamble designed to compete with Japanese manufacturers, will not roll off an assembly line until the 1990's.
Yet, for more than two years, the car has been the subject of more speculation, hype and hope than almost any other product in the

Gooden Case: Sharing Blame
LEAD: Two different statements by two Times reporters on Dwight Gooden's drug problems point up the challenge professional sports face in curbing drug use.

Spending Habits
LEAD:  To the Editor:


RECIPES TO KEEP IN HAND FOR THOSE TASTY ASPARAGUS SPEARS
LEAD: IN April and May asparagus is cheap and plentiful.
It comes in many sizes, from thin as a pencil to almost as thick as sugar cane.
All sizes are good - whether you like your asparagus served hot with melted butter and lemon juice or cold with a vinaigrette.
But after awhile, I like to be more adventurous, and serve asparagus with a puree of red peppers sprinkled with fresh tarragon or, as the Italians do, with Parmesan cheese and baked in a hot oven.


ONE OF THOSE DAYS? IT'S BETTER NOT TO PLAY
LEAD: WHAT do you do on a day when you have an awful premonition that things are going to go wrong?
Don't play.
Yes, that's right - don't play.
Because a feeling like that is invariably a valid foreboding, no matter whether it originates in unsynchronized biorhythms or any other way of being out of sorts.

AWAITING MY TURN ON A NIGHT OF STARS
LEAD: I'VE rehearsed my acceptance speech a thousand times.
It's a mix of humility, awe and gratitude, laced with professionalism and childish innocence.
It's still your basic ''I'd like to thank the members of the Academy who voted for me, my producer, my director, and my mother'' - with a focus on the film I was privileged to star in, the cast, the crew and, of course, the caterer.


Traveling With The Pack
LEAD: IT ISN'T OFTEN THAT THE COSMETICS industry thinks in purely practical terms.
But with the proliferation of makeup, hair-care and skin-treatment products that are small, lightweight and ideal for travel, it seems that common sense has at last pervaded the business.

LEAD: South African security forces fired on a group of blacks setting fire to homes in a black township near Durban, killing one man, the Government's Bureau for Information said today.


THE PALESTINIAN CAMPUS
LEAD: IT WAS THE WEEK BEFORE STUDENT-COUNCIL elections at Bir Zeit University, on the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Rival factions were trying to wrest control of the council from a coalition backing Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The campus was plastered with campaign posters depicting Jerusalem surrounded by barbed wire; fat Jews eating skinny Palestinians with forks and knives; grenades, fists and guns embedded in the map of Israel.


PARTISANSHIP'S PART IN LOCAL ELECTIONS
LEAD: Upon reading the story on the political impact - or its lack - of Westchester's recent village election  [ ''Assessing the Impact of Village Elections,'' March 29 ] , a few questions came to mind.

LEAD: Each spring, just as the crocuses wilt, the Pentagon's printing presses churn out a tulip-red broadsheet entitled ''Soviet Military Power.''

Easter, With Music, in the Park
LEAD: The woman jogger was humming ''Jesus Christ, Superstar'' as they ran down the West Road in Central Park. ''Why not, it's Easter,'' she said.

Heaven Can Wait
LEAD: If there's a heaven on earth for football coaches, Roger (Dutch) Ouderkirk may have found it not far from the Arctic Circle.
Ouderkirk, a 62-year-old assistant in charge of running backs at St.
John's, enjoys relaxed summertime employment, a certain local acclaim and the life of Riley, all in the town of Hyvinkaa, Finland.


Promoting 7-Eleven's Changes
LEAD: THE growing number of convenience stores has led 7-Eleven, the leader, to lower some of its premium prices and introduce new products and services to keep ahead of the competition.

BUSINESS DIGEST: MONDAY, APRIL 20, 1987
LEAD: COMPANIES  Dome Petroleum said it had accepted a bid by Amoco, prompting a political storm in Canada over how such a move would increase the already dominant position of U.S. companies in the Canadian oil and gas industry. [ Page D1. ] NASA's renewal of a Morton Thiokol contract was criticized by Congress and rival rocket manufacturers.


THE SEVENTH, THE EIGHT AND THE DECIDING GAME
LEAD: IT was hockey, but as the skaters skimmed slowly into quadruple overtime, the scene resembled the gradual disintegration of a marathon dance contest.
The pace slowed, and the progression up and down the ice toward goals that suddenly loomed imposing as brick walls looked almost surreal.
Even the ice seemed to respire, as if in weariness, and long glaring puddles formed at random on its surface.


CELTICS GET HOME-COURT EDGE
LEAD: It's not the ordinary home-court advantage.
That's why it was so important that Atlanta get it.


BROOKLYN MINISTER IS FOUND SLAIN IN HIS ROOM AT STOREFRONT CHURCH

THE STAGE: 'PLAIN BROWN WRAPPER'
LEAD: KEITH REDDIN, who made a splash a couple of seasons ago with ''Rum and Coke,'' has taken to concocting watered drinks.
His ''Plain Brown Wrapper,'' now being served up on the stage of the Nat Horne Theater, consists of five skits that together take about an hour.
Their main ingredient is sex of a one-liner sort; they don't deliver much of a kick.


Giant Pandas Arrive For Bronx Zoo Visit
LEAD: Two giant pandas arrived safely in New York City this weekend after a flight of more than 20 hours from China.


GIANTS WIN 8TH 1-RUN GAME
LEAD: Glenn Hubbard's fielding error at second base with two out in the ninth inning enabled Chris Brown to score from third and give the San Francisco Giants a 4-3 victory over the Atlanta Braves today.

LEAD:  ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL


A Frequent Flyer Explains the Thrill
LEAD: The mail has brought the news from XYZ Airlines that my 30,000-odd miles of travel last year qualifies me for ''premier'' status in its Frequent Flyer program (or at least I think it does: my newspaper also brought the news that the airlines have recently upped the ante in mileage requirements).
The details, however, are less important than my reaction to the honor:


Ad Industry Battling Proposed Florida Tax
LEAD: In Florida the State Senate and House of Representatives passed bills last week authorizing a new tax package that would include a 5 percent sales tax on advertising in all media.
Today a conference committee will try to iron out differences between the two versions.

LEAD: HIGH above the main auditorium of the Brooklyn Academy of Music is a handsome loft called the Lepercq Space.

A Matter of Measurement
LEAD: This will not begin with the phrase ''the long and short of it.'' Nor will there be any references to ''lofty ambitions'' or ''measuring up.''

NEWS SUMMARY: MONDAY, APRIL 20, 1987
LEAD:  International A3-9


Nothing Like a Vacation And Some Distance To Lift the Spirits
LEAD: Maybe getting away from Washington had something to do with it.
Or maybe it was just the passage of time.
Or perhaps it was the new approach to running the White House that began earlier, back in the capital, with a new management team in place.


MARK HOWE IS SKATING A STEADY COURSE
LEAD: FROM where Mark Howe sees it in the deep end of the ice where he smoothly gathers up the puck, bodies are usually flying around in front of him, someone is usually falling over someone else, and maybe, someone is throwing a punch.
Then he starts out.

WHIFFENPOOFS: 'GENTLMEN SONGSTERS' STILL
LEAD: If all goes as planned, at midnight tonight the 14 members of the 1987 Whiffenpoofs will assemble at Harkness Tower for ''Tap Night.'' With crowds of observers in pursuit they will run through the Yale University campus, stopping at the rooms of the students who have been selected to be next year's Whiffenpoofs, the fabled a capella group.


Small-Claims Attitude
LEAD: To the Editor:


Submerged Ship on Register
LEAD: The C.S.S.
Georgia, a 10-gun ironclad that helped guard Savannah from the Union Navy during the Civil War, has been added to the National Register of Historic Places even though the vessel lies 30 feet underwater.

CONCERT: 2 MASSES AT CARNEGIE HALL
LEAD: TWO masses at Carnegie Hall Saturday evening commemorated perhaps the darkest moment of the Christian year - the night before Christ's Resurrection.
As sung and played by the Gachinger Kantorei of Stuttgart and the National Arts Center Orchestra of Canada, Haydn's ''Lord Nelson'' and the Mozart ''Requiem'' offered - at least superficially - two very similar faces.


AMOCO BID FOR DOME IS ACCEPTED
LEAD: A political storm developed in Canada today after debt-ridden Dome Petroleum Ltd. announced its acceptance of a takeover bid by the Amoco Corporation of Chicago.
The transaction, worth $5.1 billion Canadian ($3.85 billion United States), would increase the already dominant position of American companies in the


Question Box
LEAD: QUESTION: Bo Jackson's sensational start this season revived memories of another running back from a college in the South who had to choose between baseball and football, Charley Trippi.
How much success did Trippi have in pro football?
Did he ever play in the major leagues in baseball?
Trippi never played in the majors after he chose football over baseball and he never regretted it because he made it to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1968, 13 years after he retired.


Stop the Espionage Race
LEAD: The medium-range missile treaty is all but wrapped up; short-range missile reduction is a sweetener just tossed in the deal; a space exploration treaty awaits signing at a summit; the old ABM treaty will be saved in the next year when a new treaty is agreed on to permit space-shield testing.


How Young &amp; Rubicam Extols Express Mail
LEAD: Cynthia Beck is a recent arrival at Young &amp; Rubicam, where she is a vice president and associate creative director.

U.S. Cautions South Korea
LEAD: Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige warned South Korea today that it must open its markets to prevent a tougher American attitude from developing over a flood of imports.


THE STAGE: 'ALL THE KING'S MEN' IN PROVIDENCE
LEAD: On its most immediate level, Robert Penn Warren's novel ''All the King's Men'' follows the rise and fall of the populist demagogue Willie Stark, the fictional equivalent of Huey Long.

He was 78 years old.
Mr.

DERBY PICTURE MUDDIER THAN EVER
LEAD: At offices and taverns around the country during the next two weeks, people who usually pay no attention to horse racing will be asked to cough up a dollar or two and pick from a hat the name of one of this year's Kentucky Derby entrants.


Egypt Oil Plan Draws Drillers
LEAD: American and West European companies will participate in a new tender by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation for oil exploration in Egypt's western desert.


THE LATE, LATE SHOW
LEAD: SO there was Harry Lime, clawing his way up the sewer stairs for the millionth time, but it was time to press the remote-control gadget and get back to the real life-and-death struggle, not in war-ravaged Vienna but in hockey-crazed Maryland.


The Editorial Notebook; New York's Old, and Fat, Constitution
LEAD: Instead of celebrating this 200th year of the United States Constitution, scholars and legal experts are ''cerebrating.'' Meanwhile, the New York State Constitution, which is older and longer - at times unfathomably longer - doesn't even warrant a public seminar on its 210th birthday, which happens to be today.


KRISHNA CONVICT FILES LAWSUIT
LEAD: A Hare Krishna follower who is serving a life prison term for the murder of another member of the sect has sued state prison officials, asserting that they have denied him the right to worship according to his religion.


Lucky Stores Chooses Grey
LEAD: Grey Advertising, Los Angeles, which until recently had the $15 million Vons Grocery Company account, has been named agency for both the Northern Food and Southern Food divisions of California's Lucky Stores Inc.
The account should bill around $30 million, the agency said.


In Arms Control, a Quiet Success
LEAD: After four years of secret talks, the United States and six allies have put a new obstacle in the path of proliferating nuclear capabilities.
They agreed to strong controls on the export of missiles and missile technologies that can be used to deliver nuclear weapons.
This is a real arms control achievement at a critical time.


GORBACHEV REMARKS ARE DENIED
LEAD: United States and Soviet officials denied today that Mikhail S. Gorbachev seriously suggested to visiting American legislators that the United States set up separate areas for blacks and other minorities.


DUGOUT MISHAP FELLS TUDOR
LEAD: John Tudor was sitting in the St.
Louis Cardinals' dugout, minding his own business today when Barry Lyons, the rookie catcher for the Mets, came running over, chasing a foul pop fly.
That led to a bizarre accident that disabled Tudor for three months or more.
It was the kind of accident that sometimes alters careers and championships.


Hotel Cuts Use of Kitchens In Ohio Poisoning Outbreak
LEAD: The Dayton Marriott Hotel closed most of its kitchens for the weekend to try to stop an outbreak of food poisoning.


FROM BOTH PARTIES, SUPPORT FOR JERSEY'S 'WORKFARE'
LEAD: When Governor Kean proposed last winter that all able-bodied welfare recipients in New Jersey be forced to go to school and seek employment, he expected sharp criticism.


WHY MYSIFY THE BUDGET?
LEAD: What's a cut in a Federal program?
What's an increase?
If you put these two questions to the average person, they probably would tell you that a cut is when some program is to get less money this year than it got last year.
Or, in the case of an increase, more money this year than last year.
If you pressed the person, he or she might adjust these numbers for inflation - that is, a cut or an increase in real terms compared to last year.


CONCERT: BERNSTEIN'S 'MASS'
LEAD: IT often happens that musical works requiring unusually large (or simply unusual) performing forces must be scaled down in order to circulate beyond the big institutions and special occasions for which they are made.
Wagner's music dramas are given all the time with reduced orchestrations; big Parisian operas were routinely cut to workable lengths for other audiences.


PRICES OF METALS RISE AMID FEARS OF INFLATION
LEAD: These are the times that swell the hearts and fill the pockets of gold bugs, that hardy band of investors in precious metals who thrive on economic misery.
While Wall Street may mock gold as a ''sterile investment'' or ''barbaric relic,'' the recent sharp rise in gold and silver prices has given investors in stocks and bonds much to worry about.

BALLET THEATER OPENING AMID GLAMOUR AND BUSTLE
LEAD: Big season openings have a special magic, and American Ballet Theater's eight-week spring engagement at the Metropolitan Opera House is one of the biggest of the dance year.

Last-minute worries and triumphs will preoccupy those who put the ballet on the stage.


PRIVATE AMERICAN-ART MUSEUM TO OPEN IN ILLINOIS
LEAD: For a cultural institution, the Terra Museum of American Art has had a meteoric career.

SMOKING CURBS POSE CHALLENGE FOR BUSINESSES

What Will Bonn Do?
LEAD: For some time, a feeling has been growing in the Reagan Administration that West Germany will probably not allow the extradition of a Lebanese, Mohammed Ali Hamadei, to this country to face charges of air piracy and murder in connection with the hijacking of an airliner to Beirut in 1985 and the death of a United States Navy diver who was among the passengers.


Business and the Law; Legal Ties With China

Barge Called a Hazard To the Gulf of Mexico
LEAD: Although the owners of a barge loaded with 3,100 tons of industrial waste from Islip, L.I., have agreed to move it from an oil rig where it was moored, the vessel will be a hazard as long as it's in the Gulf of Mexico, the Mayor of a barrier island said yesterday.


INDIANS END SLIDE
LEAD: Pat Tabler drove in three runs with a pair of singles and a bases-loaded walk to help the Indians to an 8-7 victory over the Orioles and a douleheader sweep today.
Cleveland won the first game, 3-0, on Greg Swindell's six-hitter.


TOP-OF-THE-LINE CHICKEN SOUP
LEAD: It wasn't as momentous as the splitting of the atom, but the world should note that a contest to acclaim the best chicken soup was held the other day.
No lives were lost.
No governments fell.
The sun also rose the next morning.

DANCE: 'INCEST' AT EDEN'S EXPRESSWAY
LEAD: THREE years ago, Wendy Yuni Hoffman began to have memories of having been molested as a child by members of her family.

MUSIC: BACH'S 'ST. MATTHEW PASSION'
LEAD: HELMUT RILLING'S Gachinger Kantorei delivered a stirring, expertly sung and deeply felt traversal of the ''St.
Matthew Passion'' on Sunday at Carnegie Hall.
The choir's richness and beauty of tone, and the fervency with which it gave the wide spectrum of dynamics and articulation Mr.
Rilling demanded, put to rest all the various questions that swirl around modern


China Assails U.S. on Trade
LEAD: The Chinese Government accused Washington today of delaying approval of the sale of technology products to China and said that, as a result of this policy, the United States was missing out on export opportunities.

File Now - or Pay Later
LEAD: Most Americans have now calculated their 1986 taxes, but many have not yet calculated how much 1987 tax should be withheld from their pay.

Dow Drops by 5.39 on Inflation Fears

FILM: 'EXTREME PREJUDICE'
LEAD: ACTORS get leaner and meaner when they work for Walter Hill.
The sun shines down with an angrier glare.
The gunfire is sharper, the insults more ambitious, and the only gentle sounds are those of womenfolk, as they (vainly) importune their tough guys to stay.
In this hard-boiled universe, nothing is too nasty: not a bomb inside a bunny rabbit, or a point-blank surprise shot to someone's forehead, followed by the off-handed comment ''I liked him, too.

The Star Wars Chip: Use It or Lose It
LEAD: President Reagan is fond of saying that the Russians are tough bargainers.
They are, and thus they must see what's happening to Star Wars, his key bargaining chip in the strategic arms talks.
He's on the verge of losing it.
Mr.
Reagan's vision of a Strategic Defense Initiative may never be achievable in space but it has packed a powerful diplomatic punch.

4.3% G.N.P. GROWTH DRAWS FEW CHEERS
LEAD: The economy grew at a 4.3 percent rate in the first quarter, the best performance since 1984.
Still, the news had economists scowling rather than cheering.
They say the increase came mainly from a buildup in inventories that could cause manufacturing to slow, dragging down future growth.
Most of the sectors that make up the G.N.P.


STARGAZERS
LEAD: The edge of change is the natural habitat for the leaders in any field.
They mnake it their business to know, before the rest of us, who is likely to touch our lives.

The Editorial Notebook; Crime Peril? Or Paranoia?
LEAD: After Bernhard Goetz pulled a gun and shot down four young men he believed were about to mug him on a subway train on Dec. 22, 1984, his case quickly evolved into a Rorschach test.

Q and A
LEAD:  Security Deposit  Question: We recently bought a building in Brooklyn with a commercial space on the ground floor that we are using and two rental apartments above.

New Look at 'Star Wars': Back In the Future?

Last week, a panel of leading American physicists disputed that forecast, saying it will take at least a decade of testing just to determine whether the weapons will work.

Dominican Capital
LEAD: To the Editor: On April 12 the Travel section, under the heading Dominican Republic, listed Ciudad Trujillo.

LEAD:  TRUST ME  By John Updike. 302 pp.

On no good grounds I imagine this as meaning that suburbs will grow new, then raw, and will then recede; that surgeons and scientists will daily master the use of cruder instruments; that every life will be shadowed by the inevitable onset of callowness, childhood and dreaded infancy.


STAGE: 'EXTENDED WINGS' USES FLIGHT AS A METAPHOR
LEAD: ''THERE are things about the world I can learn only from 5,000 feet above it,'' writes Diane Ackerman in ''On Extended Wings,'' her poetic memoir about learning to fly an airplane.

By Lucy Irvine. (Random House, $18.95.) Very early in Lucy Irvine's account of how she dropped out of schools and into communes, hitched rides through Britain, Western Europe and the Middle East, scrounged meals and relied on the kindness of strangers, this reader got the uncomfortable feeling that hers was less the tale of an adventuresome young woman than that of a disturbed adolescent.

BUILDERS THREATEN SUIT OVER NORTH SALEM ZONING
LEAD: NORTH SALEM'S month-old zoning code, which reduces the number of potential multifamily units by half and raises thousands of acres to four-acre residential zoning from two acre, is the most restrictive code in the state, a coalition of builders charged recently, as they announced they would sue to have the code overturned.

COXING HER WAY TO VICTORY
LEAD: I LAY THERE, THINKING ABOUT HOW MY boat was going to lose.
For two weeks, as May turned to June, the Harvard crews trained on the Thames River in Connecticut for the annual races against Yale.
This was the 14th morning I had woken up with a pain in my stomach, knowing my junior-varsity boat would practice with the varsity, that no matter how well we raced we would trail behind a superior crew.

He said one of the workers was crushed by the crane, which was being dismantled when it fell.


CASTING A WARY EYE ON WASHINGTON
LEAD: WALL STREET may not think much of the way business is done in Washington, but their comments - at least in public - tend to be diplomatic.
If tact befits players in a politically regulated industry, nobody seems to have sold the idea to Mark L. Melcher.
The 47-year-old native Iowan, first vice president and director of Washington research for Prudential-Bache Securities, writes an acerbic Potomac Perspective column advising clients of what's afoot in the political realm that could affect their investments.


PUTTING ONE'S HOUSE AND LIFE IN ORDER
LEAD: I AM beginning to think that selling a home is an unsettling experience in every sense.
About two years ago I mentioned to my children that when I reached 55, I would sell our house and make a few changes in my life.
I had been a widow for a number of years; they had established themselves out-of-town, and it seemed wasteful to be taking up so much space by myself.

FALLING AWAY, HERE AT HOME
LEAD: ''WHAT'S next?'' my daughter asks.
Her soft, expressive face has that wooden look I have seen once, or twice, in the last few months when she has spoken of her own death, so I know that she is asking me: Is this the place we have come to, now?
It is.
She is 23.
She has adrenal cancer.
Adrenocortical carcinoma is rare, with only about 150 cases a year.


IN THE WINGS, 'NOH, NOH, NANETTE'?
LEAD: THE FABULOUS EAST HAS CAP-tivated American audiences for more than a hundred years - often through the most blithely fanciful presentations.
This season, several revivals recall milestones in this long affair with Orientalia. ''The Mikado,'' the English import that triggered the craze in 1885, is currently on Broadway (this time imported from Stratford, Ontario); it features such merry anomalies as a British patter song sung by kimono-clad officials and a Japanese tea ceremony using Victorian tea service.

THE FUTURE LOOKS FAMILIAR
LEAD: A speculative foreigner in the city, in the second half of the 1980's, I stand on the deck of the ferry, at the top of the skyscraper, in the green of the park, in the melee of the midtown street, and looking around at the tumultuous presence of New York, I think it can never have been New Yorkier than it is today.


IN SEARCH OF A DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE
LEAD: WHEN prospective employees are interviewed at Simmonds Precision in Tarrytown, they are asked to take a drug test.

LEAD: THE REWARDS for the Super Bowl champions were great: parades, celebrations, parties, appearances, endorsements, commercials, autograph parties, dinners, autobiographies and more.


A Gloomy Report About Robberies
LEAD: At first the news sounds hopeful: From 1973 through 1984, the national robbery rate declined by 15 percent.
This, however, was because of a decline in unsuccessful attempts, in which a robber accosted a victim but failed to get any loot.
The rate of successful robberies remained unchanged.
Altogether, there were on average 1.2 million incidents a year.


Paying The Devil
LEAD: With push-button phones, I no longer ''dial a number,'' I ''mash'' it.

A Dream Come True
LEAD: WHEN BUSINESSMAN Eugene M. Lang delivered the commencement address nearly six years ago to the sixth graders at his former grammar school, and spontaneously promised to pay their college tuitions, he didn't know what he was getting into.

STUDY CHARTS MOTIVES FOR CHARITABLE GIVING
LEAD: Historically, many American foundations began small and were nurtured by their benefactors until they grew into sturdy institutions.
But that ''acorn theory of philanthropy'' may no longer hold, according to a new study that sees worrisome implications for the future.


UPDATING THE BARD WITH FALSTAFF IN PIN STRIPES AT THE OLD VIC


NEW YORK'S SPINNING LITERARY CIRCLES
LEAD: A writer's life may be one of dreary solitude, but the Literary Life - ah, the Literary Life promises glamour, fame, a seat next to Hemingway as he scribbles immortal prose in a Paris cafe.
The myth is so alluring it can survive even the most scaled-down atmosphere.
On a typical New York night, for instance, David Leavitt, Meg Wolitzer and Gary Glickman - all novelists in their 20's and the best of friends - are likely to be having dinner at their favorite restaurant, a dingy, hole in the wall in the West Village.


Representative Ford Indicted
LEAD: The Butcher brothers, the financiers whose now collapsed empire once included 27 financial institutions in Tennessee and Kentucky, never hesitated to think big.
Neither, according to Federal prosecutors, did Representative Harold E. Ford, a Memphis Democrat.


MAY DAY SURPRISES FOR FREE AGENTS
LEAD: THE first day of May means different celebrations to different people.

A CASE SEDUCTION BY THE BROOK
LEAD: IN 1959 CHRISTOPHER HAMPTON, 13 years old, shammed his way into an adult movie theater in which the adult movie was Roger Vadim's adaptation of ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' a bomb forgotten by nearly everyone who saw it except, of course, Christopher Hampton, for whom it became a sort of obsession.

Hunt was convicted murdering Ronald Levin, a Beverly Hills man who duped him in a business deal.
Mr.
Levin's body has not been found.


CONCERT: MUSICA SACRA OFFERS MODERN PROGRAM
LEAD: FEW organizations with the reputation of Musica Sacra would dream of devoting an evening entirely to works composed within the past 25 years.
This chorus could easily have sold out Avery Fisher Hall Friday night with music by Bach or Handel - maybe even Carl Orff or Charles Ives - but opted instead for the more difficult task of fighting for the music of our own time, with a correlative drop in attendance.


A PILGRIMAGE OF TASTES AND SIGHTS
LEAD: Siculus coquus et Sicula mensa - a Sicilian cook and a Sicilian table -was a proverbial aspiration of the gourmet in classical Rome, and throughout subsequent centuries travelers to Sicily have lavished praise on the island's food, but it is not always easy for the contemporary tourist to understand why.


HONG KONG
LEAD: May and June are bad months for sea monsters in Hong Kong, but not so bad for humans.
The dragon boat races are a lavish spectacle designed to scare away local sea monsters and fish, but they lure tourists and Hong Kong residents to the harbor.
The boat races are among Hong Kong's endearing anomalies, a reminder that the territory has not lost its soul in the process of building a financial district and a subway that works.

HOW AUTO-FOCUSING WORKS
LEAD: CANON EOS, Minolta Maxxum, Nikon N2020, Olympus OM77-AF, Pentax SF1 and Yashica 230-AF; these are the SLR cameras that represent the vanguard of auto-focusing technology.

DAVID BOWIE MINGLES GLAMOUR AND GLOOM
LEAD: EVERY FEW YEARS, DAVID Bowie turns up in a new guise -Ziggy Stardust the glitter-rocker, the jaded Thin White Duke, the stateless recluse of '' 'Heroes.' '' He writes songs that fans and waves of imitators take to heart; at the same time, he's openly theatrical, self-consciously conjuring with appearances and artifice, a series of shifty ''I's.


Concern About Inflation Rises
LEAD: Two important measures of the economic condition reported hefty increases last week.
One, a 4.3 percent expansion in the nation's output of goods in services for the first three months of the year, was quickly discounted by most analysts.
The other, a four-tenths of 1 percent increase in consumer prices in March, was more heavily weighed.


Paying The Devil
LEAD: Douglas Starr is all at sea when it comes to cats in bags (''Paying the Devil,'' On Language, March 22).
In days gone by, country yokels would buy ''a pig in a poke'' and would find to their dismay that instead of a piglet in the bag, there was a cat.
Sometimes this scam would come unstuck because someone ''let the cat out of the bag.

The Curse of Memory
LEAD: One of the bad things about getting old is that you start living in the past.
You keep remembering homey little luncheonettes where gross corporate towers now loom.
You remember buying the morning papers in midtown on the way home from a show.

A NEW CHANCE FOR 'TENDER LAND'
LEAD: THE NEW PRODUCTION OF Aaron Copland's opera ''The Tender Land,'' opening Friday at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, is more than a revival.
There have been only a few scattered productions of a revised version made by Mr.
Copland and his librettist, Erik Johns, since the premiere of the original version in 1954, so the reputation of ''The Tender Land'' rests wholly on critical reviews of the first performances, which were mixed.


FRESH SHAD MIGRATES INTO THE MARKET FROM COASTAL RIVERS
LEAD: FRESH shad, which began to appear in local markets about four weeks ago, is a sure sign of spring.

Our Fascination With Baby M
LEAD: Perhaps the saddest point of the whole Baby M case is that, in wanting to keep Baby M, Mrs.

INJURED ATHLETE, 17, RETURNS TO COMPETITION

Could this be Lester Bowie, trumpeter with the Art Ensemble of Chicago, erstwhile standardbearer of the avant-garde?

STOCKPILING LAND FOR WASTE DISPOSAL
LEAD: The March 29 letter to the editor in response to my Long Island Opinion article, ''We'll Drown in Garbage, Unless...,'' on March 1 is a melange of facts and fantasy.
It is easily demonstrable that the facts in that letter support my proposal that we stockpile land for solid waste facilities.

LEAD: SOMEONE MENTIONS sending back wine at a restaurant, and I think of a fearsome editor to whom I once was indentured.

CLARA SCHUMANN AND HER PUPILS
LEAD: CLARA SCHUMANN - THE widow of Robert, friend and spiritual mentor to Johannes Brahms, expert and often eloquent minor composer and, by all accounts, a great pianist and teacher - was one of the most remarkable women of the 19th century.

RECORDS FROM THE ROADHOUSE
LEAD: ROCK-AND-ROLL IS MORE than 30 years old as a popular phenomenon, and it's astonishing how little we really know about where it came from and how it grew.

Meanwhile, in England and Europe, the recent flood of reissued recordings from rock's early years shows no signs of abating.

THE FRAGMENTED FACTIONS THAT MAKE POLICY IN JAPAN
LEAD: PRIME Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone visits Washington this week to try to defuse the latest trade crisis.

CABARET: DORY PREVIN SINGS A POP BILL
LEAD: WHEN Dory Previn emerged onto the pop scene in the early 1970's at the height of the singer-songwriter movement, she stood out as an intriguing oddball.

HARD ROAD FOR NATIVE CONDUCTORS
LEAD: ALTHOUGH THE AMERICAN SYMPHONY OR-chestra as an institution is nearly 150 years old, it has produced remarkably few conductors of the first rank.

SCOTTISH CASTLES, MEDIEVAL AIR
LEAD: High on a promontory, overlooking the Firth of Forth as it runs into the North Sea, sits the ruin of Tantallon Castle, the 14th-century home of the Earl of Douglas.

Classical Music
LEAD: Sunday's schedule is rich in concerts that will recommend themselves to admirers of the artists involved, but my pick of the bunch is the Boston Early Music Festival Orchestra under Nicholas McGegan at Tully Hall at 8 P.M.
This group, associated with the leading festival of its kind in the Western Hemisphere, is what you've been waiting for if you assume that ''early instrument'' orchestras are either sterile or inexpert or both.

HAVE YOU HEARD THE ONE ABOUT 'PUNCHLINE'?
LEAD: EVER SINCE THE FIRST COURT jester stood before the throne and delivered a one-liner for the king, the stand-up comic has been making his uphill way in the world.
It is a calling whose heroes are mostly unsung, whose practitioners are always endangered by the threat of laughless listeners.
Comedians rank with actors and other cultural heroes, such as Sergeant York, Emile Zola and Bernadette, when it comes to being immortalized in movies, but the stand-up has been left standing, off-screen.

FADED GLORY, VANISHED HOPES By John Logue. 230 pp. Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Company. $16.95.    DREAMS of bygone glory dominate the lives of a diverse group of Alabamians in John Logue's intriguing novel, set in the capital city of Montgomery in 1967. The populist Governor, Jesse Stuart, recalls his youthful hopes that his gifts as a baseball hero would lift his family from rural poverty. A cynical newsman, Jack Harris, yearns for the passion and commitment that had distinguished his coverage of the famous bus boycott. A black clergyman, James Boone Jr., guiltily regrets his loss of faith; his parishioner, Arabella Jackson, whose son has died in Vietnam, wants to bury him on a beloved hillside, now annexed to the city's whites-only cemetery. In covering this dramatic story, Jack Harris runs into an even more explosive one: the Governor is secretly selling criminal pardons to secure his family's fortune before news of his mortal illness becomes public.   There is material here for several novels. Mr. Logue, who is the creative director of Southern Living magazine, nicely catches the inky ambiance of the newsroom before the computer terminal took over, and he has created a persuasive narrative voice for Jack Harris, the editor-narrator. Yet the author allows Harris to tell only portions of the story, disconcertingly shifting in and out of third-person narration in ways that sever the dramatic links his complicated tale requires. Moreover, perhaps his experience as the author of three mystery novels has led Mr. Logue to take technical shortcuts in which violent action substitutes for acuity in characterization.   The story is set precisely in January 1967, yet the mood of the novel seems distinctly late 1970's. Harris walks in front of Martin Luther King Jr.'s church on Dexter Avenue, musing about ''a movement now as forgotten as the river,'' without mentioning the great Selma march past that very spot not two years before. Boone complains that the burial of a black soldier shouldn't cause an uproar because ''nobody here wants to think about this war anymore,'' a sentiment that seems totally wrong for Alabama in 1967. Similarly, the police are stern with the surprisingly small number of redneck opponents of the soldier's burial and astonishingly courteous to the black mourners.   As the soldier's family watches his internment, an angry white family scrambles in the clay to remove a coffin from the adjacent plot. Having failed to rouse a violent protest, they have obtained a court order allowing them to open the grave rather than allow their mother to be buried near a Negro. Despite the historical discontinuities of the mood, Mr. Logue has written a powerful epitaph for the social conflict that still gripped Alabama in 1967.

FLY MIMICS ATTAKCING SPIDER TO SAVE ITS SKIN
LEAD: A PRINCETON University biologist was watching one of nature's predator-prey dramas unfold in the desert of Arizona.
A jumping spider stalked a fruit fly on a leaf.
As the spider shifted its back legs for the pounce, the fly spread its wings and flapped them up and down.
The spider froze, waved its legs at the fly and then beat a retreat.


Pilot in Angola Identified
LEAD: The State Department said today that the American whose private plane was shot down recently by Angolan Government forces had been identified as Joseph F. Longo of Greensburg, Pa.

BUSINESS DIGEST: TUESDAY, APRIL 28, 1987
LEAD: MARKETS  The dollar rebounded in hectic North American trading, after being pummeled in Asian and European dealings.

Some analysts predicted near-term stability for the dollar, although many remain bearish for the longer haul.
