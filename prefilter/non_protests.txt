June 2014, down around 39% from the same period last year. During the month of June
2014, the Group‟s total sales volume in China market was 25,613 units, an increase of
around 1% from the same period last year. The total sales volume in the first half of 2014
was 187,186 units, down about 29% from the same period last year and achieving 32% of
the full year sales volume target of 580,000 units in 2014.
The Spokesman of Geely Automobile said, “During the month of June 2014, the
sales volume of the Group‟s best-selling model „Emgrand EC7‟ was 10,475 units, a
decrease of about 25% over the same period last year. The aggregate sales volume of
„GX7‟ and „SX7‟, the Group‟s Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) was 5,504 units in June 2014, an

Seeking Alpha: Brazil - Samba Energy

Euan Mearns In Brazil (2013), 29% of all energy consumed and 69% of electricity consumed came from hydroelectric power. Biofuel and other renewables contributed a further 10% to renewable energy consumption bringing the renewables total to 39% making Brazil one of the world leaders in renewable energy. Since 1965, energy consumption has always run slightly ahead of energy production making Brazil a net importer of energy – oil, gas and coal. The aspiration to become an oil exporting nation suffered a set back in 2012 and 2013 with oil production falling and consumption rising. Energy independence still seems a way off. Brazil’s energy consumption has proceeded in lock step with indigenous energy production which together have provided the engine for economic and population growth. Herein lies a risk to the economy. Should Brazil fail to grow energy production in future the economy may either stagnate or the country will have to import more energy placing trade balance and currency at risk. [The post is written in a style where the Figure captions are an integral part of the text. Data sources are detailed at the end of the post. I intended to have this post on Brazil written in time for the start of the World Cup. Better late than never. ] (click to enlarge) Figure 1 Brazil is a significant oil producer with 2.1 million barrels per day (mbpd) in 2013, but for such a large country with vast off shore areas this is not an unduly large amount. It is one of the few countries in the world where liquid biofuel production is significant and stood at 317,000 bpd in 2013. In 2006, the discovery of vast oil resources in the sub-salt strata of the Santos Basin generated huge excitement. But ultra deep water and sub-salt setting has created enormous technical challenges that translate to high costs and the new play has yet to deliver to expectations. Gas production in Brazil is low compared with oil, which is unusual since the two normally go hand in hand. It is possible that gas is being flared. Brazil has very little indigenous coal production. Brazil has two nuclear reactors at a site called Angra with a third under construction. At present, nuclear provides an insignificant 1% of primary energy. Hydroelectric power is massive in Brazil and capacity has grown steadily since 1965. However, in 2012 and 2013, hydro production was also down owing to late and light rains that caused somewhat of a national emergency. No doubt some may wish to attribute this to climate change but there seems little reason to not attribute this to natural cyclical variability in climatic patterns. If the reservoirs are dry in a decade’s time, I may have to eat my words. The combined impacts of reduced oil and hydro production resulted in Brazil sucking in more oil, gas and coal imports (Figure 4) and this had a knock on adverse impact on the country’s trade balance (Figures 9 & 10). Figure 2 The raw power of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam in Brazil. Image from Rasheeds World. (click to enlarge) Figure 3 The energy consumption profile in Brazil looks similar to the production profile (Figure 1). But sharp eyes will spot that the consumption is running slightly ahead of production resulting in energy imports as shown in Figure 4. As we will see in this post and have seen in a number of earlier posts (link list at the end of this article), economic growth is dependent upon energy consumption, especially in developing nations. In maintaining a dynamic equilibrium between indigenous energy production and consumption, Brazil has allowed indigenous energy production to control the pace of economic development. This is a prudent course to follow but is radically less ambitious than the courses followed by Japan, S Korea and Germany that have forced economic expansion with imported energy paid for by exporting manufactured goods. (click to enlarge) Figure 4 Brazil imports oil, gas and coal. For the time being, ambitions to become an oil exporter have been dashed by declining production and rising consumption. Petrobras (PBR) are a world class semi-national oil company, but they may have met a major challenge to produce the ultra deep water, sub-salt fields though sub-salt production passed 500,000 bpd in June this year. But with total production of over 2 million bpd, and declines likely of the order 10%, Brazil will need to bring on over 200,000 bpd per year to just maintain production at current levels. Energy imports comprise about 17% of total energy consumed and Brazil’s energy budget remains pegged to indigenous supplies. (click to enlarge) Figure 5 Electricity generation is dominated by hydroelectric power supplemented by coal and gas. Transportation is dominated by oil significantly supplemented by biofuel (sugar cane ethanol). Unlike North European and North American countries, Brazil probably has little need for space heating where natural gas plays a major role in cold climates. But it probably has a major need for air conditioning in commerce, industry and wealthy citizens and this burden will fall to electricity that appears to account for about 50% of national energy consumption. Electricity (click to enlarge) Figure 6 The dominance of hydroelectric power in Brazil’s electricity generation is plane to see although the proportion of electricity from renewable sources has been declining since the 1990′s. Conventional thermal means coal+gas+nuclear generation. The other renewable category is the residual left after deducting solar and wind from the renewable generation reported by BP. It may comprise geothermal and biomass (timber). If Brazil’s economic growth is to continue based on indigenous energy production then they are either going to have to expand hydroelectric power, discover more gas or build more nuclear power stations. Or perhaps do all three. (click to enlarge) Figure 7 79% of electricity generation in Brazil comes from renewable sources. Hydro dominates but other renewables – presumably biomass – make a significant contribution. Brazil has insignificant solar and wind generation. Presumably the government has decided they have better renewables options else where. Population, economy and energy (click to enlarge) Figure 8 Since 1970, Brazil’s population has doubled and now stands at 200 million. There are definite signs that the rate of population growth is slowing. In the same time frame, GDP (constant $2005) has more than quadrupled. Population growth is one factor underpinning GDP growth. (click to enlarge) Figure 9 Brazil has enjoyed strong growth in bilateral trade that has over time fluctuated between surplus and deficit. The balance since 1970 is a manageable cumulative deficit of $398 billion, 35% of 2012 GDP. (click to enlarge) Figure 10 The cyclical nature of Brazil’s trade balance is clearly influenced by the energy balance. Herein lies a significant risk for the Brazilian economy. Since economic growth is based upon growth in indigenous energy supplies, should the country fail to continue to grow its energy base then the only alternative will be to import increasing amounts of energy to the detriment of trade balance and currency. Brazil either needs to work vigorously to expand energy production or devise a means of converting more energy consumption to exports. I dare say that hosting the World Cup may in the short term distort the trade figures. (click to enlarge) Figure 11 Developing countries need energy to produce GDP and growth in energy to provide GDP growth. Brazil is no exception. Note how per capita energy consumption has grown more rapidly than per capita GDP (Figure 12). (click to enlarge) Figure 12 Cross plotting the data from Figure 11 shows the clear connection between GDP and energy consumption. Somewhat worryingly for Brazil, cheap energy in 1970 produced over $6000 per capita in GDP per toe consumed while in 2012 with expensive energy the figure had fallen to below $4000. I suspect the underlying cause is larger numbers of people having access to energy for comfort, security and leisure purposes that does not gear into producing wealth. GNI PPP data shown in Figure 13 provide a somewhat modified picture. (click to enlarge) Figure 13 Summary plot of the 14 countries I have looked at in this series so far plotting similar data as in Figure 12 but this time using GNI PPP data from the World Bank in international $, money of the day. Each data set is a time series beginning in 1985 (bottom) and ending in 2012. Click on chart to get a large exploded view. The data for Brazil lies on a very similar trend to Egypt, Algeria and Turkey which are all developing nations that should be viewed as succeeding. A major problem faced by Brazil, and all of these countries, is the unequal participation of the population in creating and enjoying the fruits of economic activity. Note the total failure of Nigeria. On a per capita basis, Brazil is not yet wealthy and, like China, economic strength comes from the large population. Note how China uses significantly more energy to produce the equivalent GNI. This in part may be due to geography; energy intensive infrastructure projects; energy intensive industries and poor energy efficiency, especially in power generation.

Options Calling GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has been undergoing some significant restructuring over the recent past in a bid to cement its position in various core operations. The company has formed key partnerships in the production of various drugs, as it seeks to establish vibrant access to emerging markets and regions of East Asia. GSK's recently approved Anoro Ellipta seems to set the stage for more approvals of some of the company's respiratory products, as Japan paints a green light for the product in prospective markets. Glaxo's recent performance appeared muted, and its return on investment YTD has not been the most impressive. However, its high dividend yield makes a lucrative cushion for the failure to deliver capital gains in tandem with industry peers. Swapping Oncology for Vaccines makes sense GSK recently announced a strategic agreement with Novartis (NVS), which is aimed at swapping key assets that would result in vital business benefits, including concentrating its operation in areas that it seeks to dominate in the coming years. The company would be swapping its Oncology business with Novartis' vaccines business in a bid to strengthen its presence in the vaccines market. The deal between GSK and Novartis will form a new world-leading consumer healthcare business with 2013 pro forma revenues of over $11 billion. GSK will have majority control with an equity interest of 63.5%. GSK Chief Executive Officer Sir Andrew Witty discussed the positive benefits to shareholders and for the company: "This proposed 3-part transaction accelerates our strategy to generate sustainable, broadly sourced sales growth and improve long-term earnings. Opportunities to build greater scale and combine high quality assets in Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare are scarce. With this transaction we will substantially strengthen two of our core businesses and create significant new options to increase value for shareholders. We also expect to return £4 billion to shareholders following completion of this transaction, whilst maintaining a strong capital base and our commitment to increasing dividends." The proposed deal is expected to increase GSK's annual revenues by $2.2 billion split across the divisions; Pharmaceuticals 62%, Consumer Healthcare 24% and Vaccines 14%. Now, there are crucial benefits associated with this move. While the company is set to bring on board an unprofitable unit from Novartis, it is giving away a profitable oncology business. One would wonder what GSK sees in Novartis' underperforming vaccines business. It's simple; the company is focused on long-term benefits. Key Strategic Highlights GSK is acquiring Novartis' vaccines business for $5.25 billion. It will be paying a royalty fee of 10% on a selection of vaccine products, and has agreed to pay a contingent of $1.8 billion. On the other hand, Novartis has agreed to pay a contingent of $1.5 billion for GSK's Oncology R&D business, which it has acquired at $14.5 billion. Note that GSK's vaccines business has been doing well and the company is a force to be reckoned with in the market. Therefore, by acquiring Novartis' underperforming vaccines business, GSK will be able to leverage this deal that would result in long-term benefits for shareholders at an affordable rate. Upon completion of the deal, around 70% of GSK's revenues will be focused around four key franchises, which are Respiratory, HIV, Vaccines, and Consumer Healthcare. GSK will become a global leader in Consumer Healthcare, with over $12 billion in revenue in 2013. Upon the completion, GSK expects to be an industry leader in over-the-counter categories, including Wellness, Oral Health, Nutrition and Skin Health. Further, within the Wellness category, GSK is adding over $6 billion in complementary portfolio assets to become the world's largest OTC business with leading positions in over 35 countries. Considering the rising trends in both risk and upfront capital involved in bringing new drugs to market, pharmaceutical companies will begin to concentrate on a smaller portion of therapeutic areas in order to maximize efficiency. Fitch Ratings points out that GSK's move to dispose of its cancer drug portfolio is seen as a net positive, as the company did not have the scale to compete within the specific industry. Furthermore, the acquisition of Novartis' vaccines business will strengthen GSK's ability to focus on its higher performing areas with its research and development pipeline that includes vaccines and respiratory drugs. Fitch further discussed how the deal will effect the credit rating and its impact on GSK's financial ratios: We do not expect the transaction to affect either company's credit rating, [and further] will little impact on GSK's financial ratios, given that a large portion of the proceeds will be passed through to shareholders via extraordinary share buybacks, but we expect some margin benefit in the long term from cost savings. The group's business profile would benefit from becoming the global leader in the vaccines segment in addition to the improved position in consumer healthcare. This creates a more stable growth platform with still sufficient diversification. The fact that Novartis' vaccines business has been underperforming over the recent past means the valuation has gone down, all be it theoretically, because once GSK fits it into its own vaccines business, the long-term benefits are incremental. GSK will be inheriting a recently approved vaccine against meningitis B, first of its kind, named Bexsero. Bexsero was approved by European Health Officials in 2013, and has been given the go ahead by regulators in Canada, Australia, and partial approval in the U.S. to stop the outbreaks of meningitis across select university campuses. Now, one interesting fact about GSK's move to focus on vaccines is that this is bound to generate predictable revenues for the company with marginal benefits in the long term from cost savings. GSK estimates that total annual cost savings over $1.5 billion, 80% coming from contributions of Consumer Healthcare and Vaccines, and 20% from savings associated with the divestment of the company's oncology portfolio. The potential savings will be generated from reductions in selling and administrative overhead, removal of infrastructure overlaps and a reduction of third party contracting. GSK will divest its Oncology portfolio and related R&D activities for a lucrative aggregate cash sale of up to $16 billion to Novartis which has the opportunity to leverage its global scale and experience in this specific therapy area. GSK is looking to reshape what has been an underwhelming performance over the recent past, as highlighted in recent results. Recent results offer little to impress GSK released its Q1 2014 results in April 2014, which saw the overall revenue decline 2% after adjusting for currency translation. The pharmaceutical business declined by 10% in the US due to high competition in the respiratory drugs market. The growth remained moderate elsewhere - with Europe pegged at 3%, Emerging markets 2%, and Japan 13%. The vaccines business was up 3%, while the consumer healthcare business grew by 6% in rest of the world (excluding US and Europe). The company's operating margin shed some 270bps from Q1 2013 to 27.3%. The net profit (excluding adjustments for restructuring) edged 20% lower to £1.07 billion. The company's guidance for FY 2014 remains muted, as it expects sales growth to face headwinds due to various factors, including Lovazo losing its exclusivity, ongoing restructuring and supply problems in the US. Nonetheless, the company expects core EPS to grow by 4-8% in 2014, with analysts optimistic of a $3.49 EPS for the current year. GSK may not be the ideal income stock for the moment The company's return on investment YTD stands at a paltry 2.50%, which is significantly below the sector average of 9.45%. This is particularly unconvincing to investors considering the fact that key industry rivals like Merck (MRK) and Novartis have enjoyed better returns at 18.28% and 13.75%, respectively. Source: Yahoo Finance Nonetheless, GSK's performance is not the worst in the industry with the giant Pharma company, Pfizer (PFE), which recently failed in a bid to acquire U.K's AstraZeneca (AZN), returning (-0.33%). However, GSK's impressive 5-year average dividend yield of 4.90% is likely to provide the necessary cushion for low capital gains. The Q1 2014 dividend increased by 6% and the company is planning a further £1-2 billion in share buyback. GSK product pipeline Looking at the company's stage pipeline for pharma drugs, GSK appears to be strategically focusing on respiratory and HIV segments in 2014. Breo and Anoro have already received approvals in various markets while Incruse, which has been approved for use in the US, is awaiting release this year. However, one of the most significant and recent developments in the product involves the approval of Anoro Ellipta in Japan. Anoro Ellipta enters Japan, as GSK product pipeline continues to turn green On July 4, GSK and Theravance (THRX) announced that their respiratory drug Anoro Ellipta has been cleared by Japanese Health authorities for use to relief symptoms of airway obstruction in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases [COPD]. This approval came after positive data from eight studies in a population of ~6,000 patients. Now, based on these developments and considering the population involved in the study, Anoro Ellipta seems set for bigger things. This opens the stage for the drug as the company seeks to have it approved in other markets. The drug is also approved for use in the US and Europe. The approval of the drug for use in Japan could not have come at a better time considering the double-digit growth (13%) in the company's business in the country in the most recent quarter. David Baker, Senior Vice President and Head of GSK Global Respiratory Franchise, discussed the importance of Anoro Ellipta in Japan and how this is a huge milestone for GSK: "There are many people living with COPD in Japan whose ability to breathe is compromised by their condition. Our goal at GSK is to provide physicians with an expanded range of COPD medicines which enable a patient-centric approach to treatment, as recommended by global guidelines. We are delighted that Anoro Ellipta is now approved in Japan, making it the first GSK COPD treatment to gain Japanese regulatory approval in five years, and we believe it will be an important new once-daily dual bronchodilator treatment option for appropriate COPD patients." Meeting the Japanese guidelines brings hope to investors, as GSK may have figured out the appropriate means that will allow for further approval of the company's products. Six respiratory drugs are in the last stage pipeline, 40 NMEs in Phase II/III stage and 2 new US filings planned this year. Anoro Ellipta's successful approval for use in Japan could soon be followed by several other approvals in the coming quarters, as the company seeks to revamp its aging product pipeline with new exclusive products. In addition, the company's diabetes drug Tanzeum has obtained FDA approval and is planned for launch in Q3 2014. Conclusion GSK's restructuring is on course to reshaping the company's recent performances. The ultimate change may not happen tomorrow or by the end of this year, as this a long-term strategy aimed at changing the company's big picture. The pharmaceuticals market has been undergoing a paradigm shift in the recent past, as companies have sought to move from the traditional "jack of all trades" to specialist manufacturers. GSK has not been left behind and its latest move to swap its oncology business with vaccines outlines a key milestone. Theoretically, the company may not be the best in terms of return on investment, which also justifies its consensus hold rating by Deutsche Bank and Piper Jaffray, among other leading analysts. However, as mentioned, its high dividend yield has been a welcome cushion for underwhelming capital gains in the current year. The bottom line is that GSK's restructuring is likely to put it in a position in which incremental revenues would be highly predictable thereby boosting its valuation metrics. However, for now, the stock is only a buy for long-term investors who would be willing to swap capital gains for dividends, as the company continues to revamp its product pipeline.

Seeking Alpha: Anoro Ellipta cleared in Japan

Seeking Alpha The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approves GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Theravance's (THRX) Anoro Ellipta (umeclidinium/vilanterol) for the relief of various symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases in patients who require the concurrent use of a long-acting inhaled muscarinic antagonist and a long-acting inhaled beta2 agonist. Anoro is a once-daily treatment comprised of two broncodilators. Umeclidinium is the muscarinic antagonist and vilanterol is the beta2 agonist. Under the terms of the companies' 2002 collaboration agreement, Theravance is obligated to pay Glaxo a milestone payment of $10M based on Japanese regulatory approval.

House Ethics Committee Backtracks On Reporting Trips on Annual Forms

 
House Ethics Committee Backtracks On Reporting Trips on Annual
Forms
 
By Kenneth P. Doyle 
     July 7 (BNA) -- The House Ethics Committee reversed a
decision to drop reporting requirements for privately sponsored
travel from annual financial disclosure forms filed by House
members, leaders of the committee said in a July 3 statement.
     The decision follows a flap over the change in disclosure
policy, which was implemented by the committee without a public
announcement. The change was first reported June 30 in National
Journal.
     Ethics Committee Chairman Michael Conaway (R-Texas) and
ranking member Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) said eliminating the
travel reporting requirement from the annual forms—on which
lawmakers report assets and outside income—was justified. They
said privately sponsored trips also are disclosed through a
separate, special reporting process, and these travel reports are
stored in an online database.
 
                          News Stories
 
     News stories about the recent change, however, said that
many reporters and watchdog groups in the past have examined the
annual financial disclosure forms to find out about travel.
Eliminating this reporting requirement was condemned by watchdogs
and some House members, including House Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.).
     In response, the July 3 statement from Conaway and Sanchez
said: “We wish to take this opportunity to explain what the
Committee actually changed in its financial disclosure guidance
and why the Committee's nonpartisan staff recommended the change,
remind the House community about public disclosure of privately
sponsored travel, and announce that the Committee will return to
using its prior guidance regarding reporting of these trips on
financial disclosure reports.”
 
               Committee: Annual Disclosure Slower
 
     The statement said that disclosure of trips on the annual
forms is slower and less detailed than what is available through
the special travel-reporting system. In addition, no substantive
changes in the rules for congressional travel were made when the
requirement for including trips on the annual forms was dropped,
Conaway and Sanchez said.
     The return to earlier guidance on travel disclosure “will
not result in any additional substantive disclosure about
privately sponsored travel or any faster disclosure, and will
apply only to Members and the limited number of staff who file
financial disclosure reports,” the statement said. “Accordingly,
we encourage anyone who is looking for information about
privately sponsored travel to use the searchable online database
of detailed post-travel filings on the [House] Clerk's Web site.
The public, the media, and outside groups have used this valuable
resource for years and we anticipate that they will continue to
do so.”

FDA Releases Several Policy Documents On Its Expectations for Drug Compounders

 
FDA Releases Several Policy Documents On Its Expectations for
Drug Compounders
 
By Bronwyn Mixter 
     FDA's Oversight of Drug Compounding
     Development: FDA releases policy documents to implement drug
compounding provisions of Drug Quality and Security Act,
including proposed rule, final guidance, draft interim guidance
and two revised requests for nominations for bulk drug substances
lists.
     Next Steps: Comments on proposed rule and draft interim
guidance due Sept. 2; nominations for bulk drug substances lists
due Sept. 30.
     July 1 (BNA) -- The Food and Drug Administration July 1
issued several policy documents as part of its continuing effort
to implement the compounding provisions of the Drug Quality and
Security Act (DQSA).
     The policy documents include a proposed rule, a final
guidance, a draft interim guidance and two revised requests for
nominations for the bulk drug substances lists.
     The DQSA (Pub. L. No. 113-54), which was signed into law in
November 2013 , distinguishes between compounders engaged in the
traditional pharmacy practice of making customized drugs for
specific patient needs from those making large volumes of
compounded drugs without individual prescriptions. Compounders
outside the scope of traditional pharmacy practice can
voluntarily register with the FDA as “outsourcing facilities” and
become subject to federal oversight like traditional drug
manufacturers.
     “Providing clarity to the compounding industry on the
agency's expectations for these unapproved drug products is a
priority for the agency,” Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.
“These actions are essential next steps in providing the
compounding industry with the appropriate tools to comply with
the law and advancing the FDA's efforts to continue protecting
patients.”
 
                          Proposed Rule
 
     The proposed rule (RIN 0910-AH10) would revise the list of
drug products that may not be compounded under the exemptions
provided by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)
because the drug products have been withdrawn or removed from the
market after they were found to be unsafe or not effective, the
agency said. Specifically, the proposed rule would add 25 drug
products to this list and modify the description of one drug
product on the list to add an exception.
     The FDA said the list in the proposed rule would apply to
both compounders and outsourcing facilities seeking to compound
drugs for human use under sections 503A and 503B of the FD&C Act,
respectively. Section 503A governs traditional compounding
facilities, and Section 503B governs outsourcing facilities.
     Examples of drugs that are being added to the list include:
• alatrofloxacin mesylate, formerly marketed as Trovan injection,
which was associated with serious liver injury;
• cisapride, formerly marketed as Propulsid tablets and
suspension, which was associated with serious cardiac arrhythmias
and death; and
• methoxyflurane, formerly marketed as Penthrane inhalation
liquid, 99.9 percent, which was associated with serious,
irreversible and even fatal nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in
humans.
     The FDA said it is making revisions to the list because new
information has come to its attention since March 8, 1999, when
the FDA published the original list as a final rule. The agency
said it also is withdrawing the previous proposed rule regarding
additions to this list, which was published Jan. 4, 2000, in the
Federal Register (65 Fed. Reg. 256).
     The agency said it may propose at a later date to add to the
list other drug products that have been withdrawn or removed from
the market.
     Comments on the proposed rule, identified by Docket No.
FDA-1999-N-0194, are due Sept. 2.
 
                         Final Guidance
 
     The final guidance describes how the agency intends to
regulate entities that compound drugs under Section 503A now that
the FD&C Act has been amended by the DQSA.
     The guidance generally restates the provisions of Section
503A, describes the FDA's interim policies with respect to
specific provisions that require implementing regulations or
other actions and contains a non-exhaustive list of potential
enforcement actions against individuals or pharmacies that
compound human drug products in violation of the FD&C Act, the
agency said.
     The draft version of the guidance was published in the Dec.
4, 2013, Federal Register (78 Fed. Reg. 72,901). The FDA said
many of the comments that it received on the draft guidance
raised issues that the agency intends to address in other policy
documents and weren't directly related to the topics addressed in
this guidance.
     Comments on the final guidance may be submitted at any time.
 
                     Draft Interim Guidance
 
     The draft interim guidance describes the FDA's current
expectations regarding compliance with current good manufacturing
practice (cGMP) requirements for facilities that compound human
drugs and register with the agency as outsourcing facilities, the
agency said. The guidance focuses on cGMP requirements related to
sterility assurance of sterile drug products and the general
safety of compounded drugs.
     “This draft guidance reflects FDA's intent to recognize the
differences between compounding outsourcing facilities and
conventional drug manufacturers, and to tailor cGMP requirements
to the nature of the specific compounding operations conducted by
outsourcing facilities while maintaining the minimum standards
necessary to protect patients from the risks of contaminated or
otherwise substandard drug products,” the agency said.
     The FDA said it intends to focus its inspection and
enforcement efforts on compounding operations that pose the
highest risk to patient safety.
     The agency said it also is soliciting public input on
specific potential alternative approaches regarding certain cGMP
requirements. The potential alternative approaches are explained
in detail in the draft guidance.
     Comments on the draft guidance, identified by Docket No.
FDA-2014-D-0779, are due Sept. 2.
 
                    Requests for Nominations
 
     The FDA also is publishing two notices that reopen the
nomination process for two lists of bulk drug substances (active
pharmaceutical ingredients) that may be used to compound drug
products.
     One list is for drug products compounded in accordance with
Section 503A; the other list is for drug products compounded in
accordance with Section 503B, the agency said.
     The FDA first published requests for nominations in December
2013. The agency said that in response to the December 2013
requests, it received nominations that weren't for bulk
substances used in compounding and that didn't provide sufficient
information to justify inclusion on the lists.
     The FDA said it is providing more detail on what information
is needed to evaluate the nominations for placement on the lists.
     Nominations are due Sept. 30. The docket number for
nominations of bulk substances for the 503A list is
FDA-2013-N-1525; the docket number for the 503B list is
FDA-2013-N-1524.
 
                     Drug Compounders React
 
     The International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists (IACP)
said in a statement that it is “reviewing each of the new
guidance documents which were released today to determine whether
there is any adverse impact on the availability of customized
prescription medications for patients.”
     “The Academy is surprised, however, that at no time during a
stakeholders session held by the FDA last Thursday did the agency
mention that it was about to release new guidance documents to
the community,” the IACP said.

Pharma. Law & Industry Report: Highlights


The following is the latest issue of the Bloomberg BNA 
Pharmaceutical Law & Industry Report:

HIGHLIGHTS AND CONTENTS

1. FDA Releases Policy Documents on Expectations for Drug 
Compounders
     The FDA issues several policy documents as part of its 
continuing effort to implement the compounding provisions of 
the Drug Quality and Security Act. The policy documents include 
a proposed rule, a final guidance, a draft interim guidance and 
two revised requests for nominations for the bulk drug 
substances lists. An FDA official says that providing clarity 
to compounders “on the agency's expectations for these 
unapproved drug products is a priority for the agency.” {FIFW 
NSN N81Z2O3H0JK0<GO>} 

2. AbbVie's Patents Asserted Against Centocor's Stelara Ruled 
Invalid
     The Federal Circuit affirms a jury finding that AbbVie's 
patents on interleukin 12 antibodies are invalid for inadequate 
written description. AbbVie had sued Centocor, alleging patent 
infringement by Centocor's Stelara psoriasis treatment. Key to 
the case is that Centocor's loss in a PTO interference 
proceeding didn't estop additional invalidity arguments in 
litigation. {FIFW NSN N81WY33H0JK0<GO>} 

3. Novartis Loses as District Court Says Generic Exelon Patch 
Won't Infringe
     A federal trial court grants generic drugmaker Alvogen 
summary judgment of noninfringement in a patent lawsuit filed 
by Novartis over the Exelon patch, its branded Alzheimer's 
disease treatment. The decision for Alvogen follows a recent 
ruling in Novartis's favor involving the Exelon product. {FIFW 
NSN N7UFFC3H65TS<GO>} 

4. SPECIAL REPORT: FDA Warns That Social Media Data Can Be 
Reportable
     Drug companies are increasingly mining social media data 
for insights into drug safety and patient behavior, but an FDA 
spokeswoman tells Bloomberg BNA they need to follow reporting 
requirements about information culled from  third-party 
Internet sites. {FIFW NSN N7UIQP3H65TS<GO>} 

5. PTO's Mayo/Myriad Eligibility Guidance May Chill New Drugs, 
Diagnostics
     Development of new biotech drugs and diagnostics may be 
hindered by the PTO's guidance on eligibility based on two 
recent Supreme Court decisions, panelists tell a biotech 
conference, but they express hope for some relief because the 
agency continues to seek comments on the document. {FIFW NSN 
N802073H0JK0<GO>} 

6. FDA Releases Draft Strategic Priorities to Guide Agency 
Through 2018
     The FDA is seeking public comment on its draft strategic 
priorities document for fiscal years 2014-2018. The document 
identifies five cross-cutting strategic priorities—including 
regulatory science and globalization—and four core mission 
goals. {FIFW NSN N7ZU3C3H0JK0<GO>} 

7. Massachusetts Lawmakers Pass Bill to Toughen Rules for 
Compounders
     Massachusetts lawmakers approve a bill that would grant 
sweeping new authority to the state to regulate compounding 
pharmacies. The bill is headed to Gov. Deval Patrick (D), who 
has voiced support for tougher regulation of compounders. {FIFW 
NSN N81Z2S3H0JK0<GO>} 

8. PATENTS
     The Supreme Court receives initial briefing in a case 
challenging the Federal Circuit's de novo review of claim 
construction. {FIFW NSN N7QZZ63H65TS<GO>} 

9. PRODUCT LIABILITY
     The Supreme Court won't review two cases involving pain 
relievers that raised a CAFA jurisdiction issue. {FIFW NSN 
N7ZU353H0JK0<GO>} 

10. NEW PRODUCTS
     An FDA advisory panel votes against accelerated approval 
of AstraZeneca's olaparib. {FIFW NSN N7UFFU3H65TS<GO>} 

11. PRODUCT LIABILITY
     The Supreme Court seeks the government's opinion in a case 
allowing “failure-to-update” claims. {FIFW NSN 
N7ZYYZ3H0JK0<GO>} 

12. GENERICS
     Indian companies form a coalition to promote access to 
generic pharmaceuticals. {FIFW NSN N7UFFW3H65TS<GO>}

ADM Said to Near $3.4 Billion Deal to Purchase Wild Flavors (2)


     (Updates with closing stock price in last paragraph.)

By Aaron Kirchfeld, Manuel Baigorri and Elena Popina
     July 3 (Bloomberg) -- Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. is nearing
an agreement to buy Wild Flavors GmbH, a maker of natural food
ingredients backed by KKR & Co., for about 2.5 billion euros
($3.4 billion), people familiar with the matter said.
     ADM outbid Japanese rival Ajinomoto Co. for the privately
owned maker of the Capri Sun juice drink and natural flavorings
for beverage and food, the people said, asking not to be named
as the matter isn’t public. While a deal may get announced in
coming days, a final decision hasn’t been made, they said.
     The takeover would help the world’s top corn crusher
diversify away from grain processing and gain a bigger foothold
in overseas markets for food and beverages made with more
natural raw materials. It would be the biggest acquisition ever
for ADM, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
     Wild Flavors, which competes with Germany’s Symrise AG and
Switzerland’s Givaudan SA, has manufacturing sites across
Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Americas. In 1951, the
Zug, Switzerland-based company introduced Libella, the first
carbonated juice drink in Germany based only on natural
ingredients.
     Wild Flavors had sales of 838 million euros in 2012,
according to its website. New York-based KKR, run by Henry
Kravis and George Roberts, bought a stake in 2010 and now owns
35 percent, according to KKR’s website. Hans-Peter Wild, son of
founder Rudolf Wild, owns the rest.

                          Cargill Deal

     In 2012, Wild Flavors bought the juice blends business of
Cargill Inc., adding more than $200 million to its annual sales
and a platform to grow in Asia and North America.
     ADM, based in Decatur, Illinois, plans to invest more than
60 percent of its capital expenditures into assets outside the
U.S., president and Chief Operating Officer Juan Luciano said in
Lausanne, Switzerland in April.
     “We are still underrepresented in the rest of the world,”
he said then.
     Jackie Anderson, a spokeswoman for ADM, declined to comment
on the offer. Representatives for Wild Flavors and KKR couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment.
     ADM rose 1 percent to $45.77 at the close in New York
today, the highest since April 2008. That values the company at
about $30 billion.

Deutsche Bank : DB Today - Global/Macro : Wednesday 02nd July 2014: Wednesday 02nd July 2014

Synopsis:
  *

   
 
   *Global Strategy - Global Strategy Flash - Dominic Konstam
 
   U.S. Rates: We believe that we have established a new lower range of 2.40% 
to 2.60% in 10y Treasury yields. The risk is more likely that we break through 
the lower end toward, say, 2.25% rather than break back above towards 2.75% or 
3%, at least over the next month or so. That suggests to us that investors 
ought to use setbacks to cover shorts and protect against downside risks in 
yields, especially if it carries elements of risk-off either geopolitical or 
further disappointment in the US/global growth outlook. Details on page 8
 
   *Credit Strategy - Early Morning Reid - Jim Reid
 
   Tuesday’s US data docket was probably supportive of the theme that the 
economic recovery is a slow and steady one. Case in point was the US ISM which 
was basically unchanged at 55.3 for the month of June (vs 55.4 prior month). 
This was one of the higher readings of the last few years, but was below 
expectations of 55.9. The prices paid subcomponent printed at 58.0 which is 
broadly in the same range as it has been over the last six months. Consistent 
with the neither-hawkish-or-dovish feel of the ISM, construction spending 
growth of +0.1% was below expectations of +0.5% but this was offset by large 
upward revisions to April’s data. One of the stronger data points came from US 
vehicle sales for June which beat consensus across GM, Ford, Chrysler and 
Nissan. The total rate of sales increased to 16.98m (vs 16.70m previous and 
16.38m expected) and this marked a post financial crisis high, despite a lower 
number of selling days this June compared to a year earlier. This prompted a 
sharp rally in GM stock yesterday (+3.35%). 10yr UST yields closed about 3.5bp 
higher at 2.565%, though most of that move occurred before the data flow. 
Details on page 9
 
   *FX Strategy - FX Daily - Henrik Gullberg
 
   Two European central banks facing a similar dilemma will today (Poland’s 
NBP) and tomorrow (Sweden’s Riksbank) decide on whether to reduce rates 
further. In both cases the real economy is growing at a decent clip, but spot 
CPI has fallen to levels making central bank board members uncomfortable. In 
both cases job growth is ticking up nicely, but without much of a feed through 
to wage inflation. In both cases the rates market is priced for another 25bp 
rate cut, plus an additional 10-15bps over the next 6 months, and rates not 
seen meaningfully (25bps) higher than current levels until the very end of 
2015/beginning of 2016. Details on page 10

One NSA Superpower Actually Not Being Abused, Panel Finds: View

By The Editors

July 2 (Bloomberg View) -- The National Security Agency has come in for a lot
of criticism in the past year, some of it justified, as news has leaked out
about its colossal global espionage operations. There was news of a different
sort yesterday: The NSA has a power that actually isn't being abused. The
challenge now is how to keep the agency on the straight and narrow.

The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an independent executive
agency, found that the NSA has legally and effectively used its authority
under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. That section allows the NSA to
monitor electronic communications -- including the content of phone calls and
e-mails -- in search of foreign intelligence. The catch is that it has to
reasonably believe that its targets are non-Americans and outside the U.S.

The NSA’s Gigantic Haystack

Under this authority, the NSA gathers more than 250 million Internet
communications a year. It can intercept information on 193 countries. In 2013
alone, it targeted nearly 90,000 foreign groups and individuals for
surveillance.

That's the kind of thing that infuriates U.S. allies. But it's legal, and much
of it has proven quite valuable: The board found 20 cases in which such
surveillance aided counterterrorism investigations, and 30 in which it
identified previously unknown terrorists or plots. More than 100 people have
been arrested as a result.

The board also found no "evidence of bad faith or misconduct" in using the
program.

That's not to say it's without problems. Sometimes the communications of
innocent U.S. persons -- a term of art that includes U.S. citizens, companies
and permanent residents -- also get swept up, whether accidentally or because
they were in contact with a foreign target.

A lot of regulations cover the use of these data. But the NSA asserts that,
once collected, it can be lawfully searched by its agents and others. The
Central Intelligence Agency conducted about 1,900 queries of such information
in 2013. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, alarmingly, says it doesn't
track how often it accesses the communications of Americans gathered under
this program but "believes the number of queries is substantial."

In fact, the report says that the government has no idea how much data it
collects on Americans, and it notes that the rules "potentially allow a great
deal of private information about U.S. persons to be acquired."

The board was split on exactly how to treat that information, an issue that
gets pretty complicated. But the bottom line is this: If intelligence agencies
are intentionally sifting through these data for the content of specific
Americans' communications, they should get a warrant -- except in emergencies
-- just as the Constitution requires in all other cases. This was the standard
recommended by the president's NSA review panel in December. And it's the
standard the House of Representatives voted to affirm last month. The Senate
should do the same.

The board offered a few other suggestions, which it says are "designed to push
the program more comfortably into the sphere of reasonableness." That's a
phrase only a panel of lawyers could love, but their reforms are mostly
thoughtful and measured, designed to mitigate gaps in oversight and
compliance. They also recommend clarifying when spies can target foreigners --
a step that may, someday, help soothe the ire of U.S. allies.

Section 702, as the panel's report shows, gives the NSA a lot of power. Making
sure it's only used against the right people will require a lot of vigilance,
too.

Tinder Suit for Sexual Harassment Reinforces Boys’ Club Image


By Alex Barinka
     July 3 (Bloomberg) -- A lawsuit filed by a female executive
alleging harassment and discrimination at a popular dating
startup is reinforcing concerns that the technology industry is
still a boys’ club that’s unwelcoming to women.
     Whitney Wolfe, former vice president of marketing for
Tinder Inc. who described herself as a co-founder, said in a
lawsuit filed June 30 that co-founder Justin Mateen verbally
disparaged her and that company executives ignored her
complaints and didn’t publicly recognize her as a co-founder
because she’s a “girl.”
     Tinder’s Chief Executive Officer Sean Rad said in an
internal memo to employees obtained by Bloomberg News and
confirmed by the company that the allegations are “full of
factual inaccuracies and omissions.” Rad and the company, as
well as parent IAC/InterActiveCorp, which was also named in the
lawsuit, haven’t yet responded in court.
     The allegations raised in the complaint underscore the
perception of the U.S. technology industry as a male-dominated
culture unfriendly to women, according to Scott Kessler, an
analyst at S&P Capital IQ in New York.
     “Although it is tempting to describe the conduct of
Tinder’s senior executives as ‘frat-like,’ it was in fact much
worse -- representing the worst of the misogynist, alpha-male
stereotype too often associated with technology startups,”
Wolfe said in her complaint against Tinder, filed in state court
in Los Angeles.

                         Gender Equality

     Rad, 28, said in his memo that the startup “did not
discriminate against Whitney because of her age or gender” and
takes gender equality very seriously.
     Rosette Pambakian, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based
Tinder, declined to comment beyond Rad’s memo.
     Tinder was hatched two years ago during a hack-a-thon at an
incubator backed by billionaire Barry Diller’s IAC. Though Wolfe
was with the company from the onset and had been recognized as a
co-founder, Rad stripped her of the title when she was 24,
according to her complaint.
     Wolfe said in her lawsuit that she was subjected to sexist
comments, e-mails and text messages from Chief Marketing Officer
Mateen, 28, and that her complaints were ignored by CEO Rad. She
said she was forced to resign and is seeking compensatory
damages including back pay and equity.
     Mateen was suspended upon the receipt of Wolfe’s
allegations, pending an ongoing internal investigation, said
Matthew Traub, a spokesman for IAC.

                     ‘Unequivocally Condemn’

     “Through that process, it has become clear that Mr. Mateen
sent private messages to Ms. Wolfe containing inappropriate
content,” Traub said in an e-mail. “We unequivocally condemn
these messages, but believe that Ms. Wolfe’s allegations with
respect to Tinder and its management are unfounded.”
     Mateen didn’t respond to an e-mail sent to his work address
seeking comment on Wolfe’s lawsuit.
     The allegations could have an impact on IAC’s plans for
Tinder, according to Kessler.
     Tinder is part of IAC’s Match Group, a business segment
that was separated into its own unit in December, potentially
setting the stage for a spinoff of the dating services.
     “Given what’s going on at Tinder, I would assume that
probably would cause IAC and Match to think a little bit longer
and harder about pursuing that at this juncture,” Kessler said.
     Even as the technology industry’s glass ceiling is being
shattered by high-profile executives like Facebook Inc.’s Sheryl
Sandberg and Yahoo! Inc.’s Marissa Mayer, complaints about
gender equality persist.

                    Underrepresented Females

     Technology companies Google Inc. and Facebook have recently
acknowledged that women make up 30 percent and 31 percent of
their workforces, respectively, ramping up pressure on Silicon
Valley to hire more women and minorities.
     Facebook and Twitter Inc. were criticized leading up to
their initial public offerings for not having any female
directors, and 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and
mathematical occupations last year were men, according to the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
     Snapchat Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel apologized in May for
profanity-laced e-mails he sent during his fraternity days at
Stanford University that celebrated getting drunk and convincing
sorority women to perform sexual acts.
     In March 2013, Adria Richards received threats of violence
and was fired from her software job at startup SendGrid Inc.
after she posted an image online of male programmers she accused
of making inappropriate innuendos at a programming event in
Santa Clara, California. Critics said Richards mishandled the
offense and defenders said her dismissal will discourage
standing up to misconduct.

                        Sexual Harassment

     Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &
Byers, sued the venture-capital firm in 2012 alleging it treated
female employees unfairly by promoting and compensating them
less than men. She said she faced retaliation after she
complained about sexual harassment. Kleiner, which tried
unsuccessfully to move Pao’s claims to arbitration, has denied
the allegations.
     “Unfortunately, it seems like these types of issues have
surfaced at a number of technology companies and startups over
the years,” Kessler said.
     The case is Wolfe v. Tinder, BC550105, California Superior
Court (Los Angeles).

Airports Serving U.S. Tighten Checks on Stealth-Bomb Threat (2)


     (Updates with comments from U.K. Prime Minister Cameron in
seventh paragraph.)

By Chris Jasper
     July 3 (Bloomberg) -- Airports including London Heathrow,
Europe’s busiest, stepped up security checks with unspecified
measures in response to U.S. warnings amid concern that a new
generation of bombs could evade existing scans.
     A number of overseas airports with direct flights to the
U.S. have been asked to implement enhanced security checks in
coming days, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a
statement last night. U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said
the threat could prove to be a long-term one.
     Scrutiny is being heightened as spiraling conflict in the
Middle East prompts an increased flow of western jihadists.
Newspapers including the London-based Times cited U.S. officials
and security sources as saying the latest threat concerns an
alliance of al-Qaeda-inspired terrorists in Syria and Yemen
equipped with hard-to-detect “stealth” bombs.
     “We have taken the decision to step up some of our
aviation security measures,” the U.K. Department for Transport
said in a statement today. “For obvious reasons we will not be
commenting in detail on those changes.”

                        ‘Substantial’ Threat

     British Airways, the biggest carrier at London Heathrow
with almost 800 weekly services to and from 24 U.S. airports,
said that while it’s operating as normal the tighter checks
mean travelers must arrive in good time for flights both at
check-in booths and boarding gates. The airline works closely
with airports and governments around to world on safety and
security issues, it said in an e-mailed statement.
     Discount carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle AS, which started
flying from London Gatwick airport to the U.S. this week, is
aware of the security situation, Chief Executive Officer Bjoern
Kjos said in an interview. The carrier commenced Gatwick-Los
Angeles services yesterday and added New York flights today,
with trips to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, following tomorrow.
     British Prime Minister David Cameron’s office said people
should continue to fly as usual, and that while there is “an
evolving threat to the U.K. and to other countries,” the
official threat level has not been raised from “substantial.”
    That’s the third rung in a five-grade system and indicates
that there is “a strong possibility” of an attack, according
the website of the U.K. Security Service or MI5.
     Passengers should not experience significant disruption
from the extra checks, according to the DfT. Steps could include
measures aimed at finding non-metallic explosive devices able to
evade detection by current equipment.
     Heathrow Airport Ltd. said it doesn’t comment on security
measures and that security levels are a matter for the DfT.
     Travelers will probably have to endure “another layer” of
security for some time, Deputy Prime Minister Clegg said on
London’s LBC Radio, adding: “I don’t think we should expect
this to be a one off temporary thing.”

Payrolls Jumped as U.S. Jobless Rate Fell to 6.1% in June (3)


     (Updates with stocks in fifth paragraph.)

By Shobhana Chandra
     July 3 (Bloomberg) -- Job creation surged beyond
expectations in June and the unemployment rate fell to an almost
six-year low of 6.1 percent, underscoring the strength of a U.S. 
labor market that will help spur a rebound in growth.
     The addition of 288,000 jobs followed a 224,000 gain the
prior month that was bigger than previously estimated, Labor
Department figures showed today in Washington. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a
215,000 advance. The number of long-term unemployed Americans
fell to 3.1 million, showing they’re having greater success
finding work.
     A rebound in the economy after a first-quarter slump is
encouraging companies such as Ford Motor Co. to add to staffing
levels, laying the groundwork for a pickup in wages needed to
further propel consumer spending. More employment opportunities
will probably keep Federal Reserve policy makers on the path to
reduce monetary stimulus.
     “The improvement in the labor market is accelerating,”
said Robert Stein, deputy chief economist at First Trust
Portfolios LP in Wheaton, Illinois, and the top forecaster of
payrolls the past two years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. “We’re seeing a self-sustaining recovery where
production growth leads to job growth, which leads to
consumption growth.”
     Stocks rose after the report, with the Dow Jones Industrial
Average climbing above 17,000 for the first time. The Dow
climbed 0.3 percent to 17,030.08 at 9:32 a.m. in New York. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index also advanced 0.3 percent to a
record. Equities markets close at 1 p.m. today before the
Independence Day holiday.

                       Service Employment

     Factories took on the most workers in four months, while
payrolls at private service providers climbed by the most since
October 2012. An index gauging the breadth of private-industry
hiring in June climbed to 64.8 from 62.9 a month earlier.
     The number of people out of work for 27 weeks or longer --
the so-called long-term unemployed -- decreased as a percentage
of all jobless to 32.8 percent, the lowest since June 2009.
     Payroll estimates of 94 economists in the Bloomberg survey
ranged from gains of 145,000 to 290,000 after a previously
reported 217,000 advance. The unemployment rate, which is
derived from a separate Labor Department survey of households,
fell to the lowest since September 2008. It was projected to
hold at 6.3 percent, according to the survey median.
     Revisions to prior reports added a total of 29,000 jobs to
overall payrolls in the previous two months.

                         Jobless Claims

     A separate report from the Labor Department today showed
little change in the number of Americans filing applications for
unemployment benefits last week, a sign that employers are
limiting dismissals.
     Jobless claims rose by 2,000 to 315,000 in the week ended
June 28. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for 313,000 claims. Economists’ estimates ranged from
305,000 to 325,000 after an initially reported 312,000 in the
week ended June 21.
     In June, applications for jobless benefits ranged from
313,000 to 318,000. Fewer firings typically foreshadow an
acceleration of job growth.
     Figures from the Commerce Department showed the U.S. trade
deficit narrowed 5.6 percent in May to $44.4 billion, helped by
record exports. The value of petroleum imports was the smallest
since November 2010.

                       Private Employment

     Today’s payrolls report showed that private employment,
which excludes government agencies, rose by 262,000 in June
after a 224,000 gain the prior month.
     Paige Sims, 33, said a networking event helped her get
hired as a product safety engineer at General Electric Co. She
started work on June 30 after searching for about four months.
     “It was a little easier” to find employment given her
work experience of almost 10 years and her location in
Greenville, South Carolina, a growing, highly industrial city
with many large manufacturing facilities, she said.
     “The labor market is growing for technical people like
engineers and scientists, and may be a little more sluggish for
those who’re in other fields,” said Sims.
     The so-called participation rate, which indicates the share
of the working-age people in the labor force, held at 62.8
percent.

                         Help Wanted

     Help-wanted signs at concrete company Kent Cos. is one
indication of an improving labor market. Warren Buffett’s BNSF
Railway Co. plans to grow by 2,100 positions in 2014. SolarCity
Corp. is adding 400 people a month at the rooftop power-system
installer. At Ford Motor Co., hiring is so strong that the
automaker predicts it may beat a 2011 plan to bring on 12,000
new workers by 2015.
     That’s because of stronger demand for automobiles. Cars and
light trucks sold at a 16.9 million pace in June, the strongest
since July 2006, after a 16.7 million rate in May, based on data
from Ward’s Automotive Group. Deliveries at General Motors Co.
and Ford, the two largest U.S. automakers, exceeded analysts’
estimates.
     Recent strides in the labor market underscore the economy’s
snapback from a first-quarter contraction. The economy shrank at
a 2.9 percent annualized rate from January through March, the
biggest drop-off since the first quarter of 2009, the Commerce
Department reported last month. Consumer purchases grew at the
weakest pace in five years.

                        Second Quarter

     Gross domestic product probably bounced back in the second
quarter and will expand at an average 3.1 percent rate in the
remaining two quarters of 2014, according to the median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey conducted June 6 to June 11. Household
purchases are also expected to improve, it showed.
     Recent data are consistent with the outlook. Factories,
propelled by the strongest orders of the year, sustained gains
in June and are poised to be part of the rebound, the Institute
for Supply Management’s manufacturing report showed this week.
     Businesses paring their workforce include Key Technology
Inc., a Walla Walla, Washington-based maker of food and material
processing automation equipment. The company said it will reduce
about 8 percent of its global staff as it remains “vulnerable”
to ups and downs in its markets.
     Today’s Labor Department’s payrolls report also showed
factory hiring increased by 16,000 in June. Employment at
private service-providers jumped 236,000. Retailers took on
40,200 employees.

                        Hourly Earnings

     Average hourly earnings rose by 0.2 percent for a second
month, to $24.45 in June from the prior month, and increased 2
percent over the past 12 months. The average work week for all
workers held at 34.5 hours.
     Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last month that she expects
consumer spending will continue to grow at a “healthy rate,”
in part as bigger income gains materialize.
     “My own expectation is that as the labor market begins to
tighten, we will see wage growth pick up some,” Yellen told
reporters on June 18 after the Fed’s policy meeting. “If we
were to fail to see that, frankly I would worry about downside
risk to consumer spending.”
     Yellen’s dashboard of job market progress spans nine
measures, including payrolls, the jobless rate, underemployment,
labor force participation, and the share of long-term unemployed
workers. It also monitors the job openings rate, layoffs and
discharges, the hires rate, and the quits rate.

Mongolia Passes Mining Changes to Boost Exploration (Correct)


     (Corrects information in third paragraph to show that
Mongolia’s parliament voted to block government investment in
the Tsagaan Suvarga project.)

By Michael Kohn
     July 2 (Bloomberg) -- Mongolia’s parliament yesterday
approved changes to the nation’s 2006 Minerals Law, a
development that may spur renewed investment in the flagging
economy.
     Passage of the amendments was announced on the Great
Hural’s website. The legislature, which ended its spring session
today, also passed a new law on energy to help expand that
sector.
     In another vote, parliament blocked government investment
in the Tsagaan Suvarga copper and molybdenum project, according
to Otgochuluu Chuluuntseren, director general of the Ministry of
Mining’s department of strategic policy and planning.
     The flurry of activity comes amid Prime Minister
Altankhuyag Norov’s 100-day push to jump start the economy after
more than two years of slowing growth and plunging foreign
investment. FDI fell 52 percent last year and dropped 64 percent
in the first five months of 2014, due in part to plunging coal
prices and disputes with key investors, including Rio Tinto
Group.
     Drafts of the Minerals Law amendments included the creation
of a National Geological Survey and the formation of a Policy
Council to oversee legal changes in the mining industry. The
final version of the changes hasn’t yet been made public.

                           Mining Area

     Mining law amendments will increase the proportion of
Mongolia’s area available to mining and exploration to 20
percent from about 8 percent, by lifting a 2010 ban on new
licenses, according to comments made in May by Mining Vice
Minister Erdenebulgan Oyun. The period of exploration will also
increase to 12 years from nine years, he said.
     Passage of the amendments may also lead to a resolution to
last year’s cancellation of 106 mining licenses, according to
Otgochuluu.
     “Uncertainty that has been hanging over the mining and
exploration sector for quite some time has been finally resolved
with minimal amendments,” Dale Choi, head of the consultant
Independent Mongolian Metals & Mining Research, said by e-mail
today. Investors should “be content that major parties can
agree at the last minute on some major issues.”
     The Ministry of Mining said in May that the government
intended to buy a 34 percent stake in Tsagaan Suvarga, a project
owned by Ulaanbaatar-based Mongolyn Alt LLC. The ministry’s
Erdenebulgan said Mongolia would sell bonds to pay for its
purchase of the mine stake.
     In May, Erdenebulgan said passage of the mining and energy
laws may lead to $1 billion in new investments. Replacing
Mongolia’s 1991 Petroleum Law could expand investment
opportunities to include different types of contracts between
parties and regulate new energy sources including Mongolia’s
nascent oil shale industry, he said.

Richter's Q1 results were slightly positive - Instant Earnings Comment from Concorde Securities Ltd. (Hungary)

Gedeon Richter - Instant Earnings Comment
Recommendation: Underweight (unch.)
Target price: HUF 4,080 (unch.)
Current share price: HUF 3,730
 
 
Main points:
 
 
- Richter's Q1 clean EBIT beat the consensus estimate. (HUF 10.3bn vs. HUF
8.8bn)
 
 
- Q1 clean net income also were better than the consesnus estimate (HUF 9.3bn
vs. HUF 7.9bn) 
 
 
- Total revenues came to HUF 89bn (+3% YoY) vs. the consensus estimate of HUF
86bn
 
 
- Clean EBIT margin averaged at 11.6% vs. consensus estimate of 10.2%
 
 
- Gross margins at 62.7% were also higher than the consensus estimate of 60.9%
 
  
- Q1 results were broadly in line with our full year earnings estimate
 
 
-  We maintain our annual operating and net results forecasts and reiterate our
eoy TP as well as Underweight rating on the share 
 
 
 
Gedeon Richter (GR) provided first quarter clean EBIT of HUF 10.3 bn (-13% YoY),
which was 17% and 16% ahead of the consensus and our estimate, respectively.
Clean net income came to HUF 9.3 bn (-41% YoY) exceeding both the consensus as
well as our prediction by 18 %. (Positive)
 
 
 
Reported EBIT plummeted 33% YoY, albeit from a high base, which was supported by
milestone income of as much as HUF 3.4 bn received from Forrest Labs. Reported
net income was also significantly lower than a year ago (-51% YoY) because of
worse operating performance and financial losses. The latter was primarily
caused by unrealized losses on certain FX items (primarily due to the weakness
in the RUB).
 
 
 
 
GR earned HUF 89 bn in total revenue, an increase of 3% in HUF terms (-1% in EUR
terms), beating the consensus estimate of HUF 86 bn and coming in line with our
estimate. Exports represented 89% of total revenue and rose 3% in HUF, while
dropping 1% in EUR.
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmaceutical sales represented 88% of revenue and grew 2% YoY in HUF, while
female healthcare medicines, mostly propelled by sales in WEU and new markets
(China and LATAM), went up by 17% YoY in HUF and accounted for 35% of
pharmaceutical sales, up from 31% in the same period last year.
 
 
 
Sales in WEU caught us by a positive surprise, while revenue from Russia (-11%
YoY in HUF) fell short of our estimate reflecting the weakness in RUB and
difficulties in distribution. Polish sales remained weak (-11% YoY in HUF),
whereas other CEE countries including Hungary performed very well (+10% in HUF),
as expected. US sales appear to have been bottoming out shored up by Plan B
OneStep after FDA's approval to market the emergency OC product for use w/o a
prescription by woman 15 years of age and older.
 
 
 
Gross margin fell from 64% to 62.7% primarily due to the weakness in RUB as a
combined result of higher CIS and US sales. Underlying EBIT margin was 220 bps
worse on the year (11.6% vs. 13.8%).
 
 
 
 
Although Q1 results were somewhat better than our estimates, they were broadly
in line with our annual earnings estimates. We keep therefore our annual
operating and net earnings forecasts unchanged.
 
 
 
 
Richter's current valuation still looks stretched at a P/E of 19.5x and an
EV/EBITDA of 9.5x based on our 2014 earnings estimates. EV/EBITDA multiple is
about 10% higher than its historical average. Note that, RUB depreciation aside
the current year's earnings are also highly burdened by the elevated costs of
R&D spent on original products, as well as S&M spending devoted to promote new
product launches in WEU, LATAM, China and the CIS countries.
 
 
 
 
We maintain our eoy PT at HUF 4,080 per share, leaving a 9% upside from the
current share price that we think is still not enough to compensated for the
elevated risks of the worsening revenue and margin outlook in Russia and
Ukraine. We reiterate our Underweight on GR, noting that the somewhat better
than expected Q1 results could temporarily incite some enthusiasm for the share.

Richter - Further cut in profits and TP on the weak outlook in Russia and Ukraine - Earnings Revision from Concorde Securities

Gedeon Richter - Earnings Revision
Recommendation: Underweight (unch.)
 
Target price: HUF 3,900 (prev. HUF 4,080)
 
Current share price: HUF 3,790
 
 
 
 
Richter has warned again that its FY2014 Russian sales (c.22% of total revenue
in Q1 2014 vs. 28% in the same period of last year) may plunge 20% in EUR terms
mostly because of currency pressure. The RUB has depreciated around 15% YoY vs.
the HUF from a RUBHUF exch. rate of 7.3x early May 2013 to 6.2x as of today.
Although Q1 EBIT margin averaged surprisingly at around 11.6%, the Richter's CEO
admitted that FY2014 EBIT margin could stay around 11% compared to the
management's previous guidance of 12-13%, indicating further erosion in the
remaining of the year. CEO added that the prospects for growth in Russia and
Ukraine are clearly worrisome.
 
 
 
 
Previously, CEO had said the RUB's steep depreciation against the EUR, if
sustained throughout this year, could slash the value of Richter's exports to
Russia by up to EUR 66 million in 2014 compared to 2013, a view with which we
fully agree. Currency depreciation is reflected in profit, and the company
anticipates that every 1 percent fall in the value of RUB vs. the HUF cuts
profit by about HUF 550 mln (1.4% of EBIT for FY2014 on our old earnings
estimates).
 
 
 
 
Although we have already been wary of Richter's Russian and Ukrainian outlook
for the forthcoming years, the second profit warning for 2014 in a row pointing
out that Richter is grappling desperately with difficulties mounting in Russia,
as we have already warned on it, and that it will take quite a long time until
the company will be able to stabilize its sales (see our report on Richter
published on 5 February 2014). As a result, we feel it appropriate to reduce our
FY2014 revenue estimate further (by EUR 36 mln or 3.1%) to EUR 1.13 bn, which
indicates a 4.3% decline on 2013. Accordingly, we cut our full-year EBIT
estimate from HUF 39.6 bn to HUF 36.4 bn, and our EBIT margin forecast with it
from 11.7% to 11%. We prudently trim our EBIT estimates for the coming years as
well, as we see little chance of a recovery in the Russian and Ukrainian revenue
growth rates. Positive developments on the approval of Cariprazine could result
in milestone income to the tune of USD 15 mln in the last quarter, on which we
do not count presently.
 
 
 
 
Richter hopes that its healthy product portfolio and widespread sales network
provide opportunities for growth once the crisis subsides, while expansion in
Western Europe, China and LATAM would also help diversify its revenue exposure
(including increasingly high-margin female products) and compensate for
shortfall in revenue in its traditional markets.
 
 
 
 
Richter's current valuation looks stretched at a P/E of 21.6x and an EV/EBITDA
of 9.9x based on our new 2014 earnings estimates. EV/EBITDA multiple is about
10% higher than its historical average.
 
 
 
We cut our eoy TP from HUF 4,080 to HUF 3,900. We maintain our Underweight
rating on the stock. We are of the view that Richter's earnings outlook remains
dreary for a while, particularly in the light of the recent weakness in RUB, and
an escalation of political turmoil in Ukraine taking a toll on earnings already.
5-yr EPS CAGR is expected at 9% in HUF on our calculation. Having said that, the
weaker HUF vs. the EUR and USD may shore up revenue as well as margins should it
remain permanent.

                             Q1 2014 Earnings Call

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION

  Operator:
  Good day and welcome to the Richter First Quarter Conference Call. Today's 
  conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the 
  conference over to Mr. Erik Bogsch, Managing Director. Please go ahead, sir.

  Erik Bogsch:
  Thank you very much. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and good afternoon 
  to - in the U.S. or Canada. Well, I would like to give you the summary of Q1 
  of this year, and I'll talk about sales and then I will pass it onto Katalin,
  our head of Investor Relations who is also participating in the call. And 
  then later - and then, she will talk about the margins. And then Dr. Gbor 
  Gulcsi, our CFO, he will talk about the financials and then I will update you
  on our forecast and maybe I will make some comments about Russia and Ukraine 
  and where we stand.
  So on Q1, I think that as indicated the guidance in Ukraine is obviously 
  hitting hard, not just our sales in Ukraine but also having a sort of 
  indirect effect because of the weakening of the ruble in Russia. So that has 
  been basically very negative - it has a very negative impact on our sales in 
  these two countries. And we managed to creating some additional sales and 
  indicating nice growth in the EU15 countries and also in other CIS republics.
  As far as the profits are concerned, obviously this is a big drop compared to
  last year's first quarter. I would like to add that it's important that there
  were no milestones in this quarter whereas there was a milestone in last year
  in the first quarter, and obviously the exchange rates weakening, not just 
  euro or ruble, but also the Hungarian forint/ruble has a very negative impact
  on our profit, and of course, the financials are negative this year.
  So talking about sales and markets, first of all, I would like to mention 
  that in Hungary, it seems that the situation has stabilized. We managed to 
  increase our sales not just in local currency, but equally in euro terms, 
  that's basically thanks to introducing some new products and I think this 
  quarter [indiscernible] (2:48) of our medical representatives also been 
  managed to have good sales in products that - across the board. As far as 
  [indiscernible] (3:00) except Hungary that we achieved EUR255 million, which 
  is slightly lower,  1.3% lower than last year, but specially CIS was lower, 
  15.2%. And if you talk about Russia, and of course, I am talking just on the 
  pharmaceutical sales then in ruble terms is 5.6% lower than the last year but
  because of the ruble/euro exchange rate, which has weakened substantially 
  16.4%. Altogether that means that our sales in translative to euro, of course
  the invoice all in ruble, it was minus 21.7%.
  In Ukraine, the invoice is $19.5 million, which is 20.7% lower than last 
  year. In the EU, we sold EUR83.8 million and sales in Poland were weaker, 
  which is mainly due to, we have one product which is used in the flu and 
  there was no real flu in Poland, so Groprinosin sales are much slower, other 
  products reasonably good, some of them even higher than last year in the 
  first quarter. And [indiscernible] (4:37) our sales, especially in the 
  emergency contraceptives and oral contraceptives. In Romania, there was a 
  slight increase and there was also increase of the sales in euro terms in the
  EU10 and especially nice increase, of course, a bit low base and is just 
  talking one quarter, but nevertheless nice sales in the EU15, EUR37 million, 
  which is more than 20% higher than last year.
  And now EU15 accounts for 44% of our total EU sales that you may recall, 
  earlier it was just one-third, so that means that EU15 is really growing 
  nicely.
  In U.S., we are slightly higher than last year, mainly [indiscernible] (5:28)
  higher. China, a bit of growth and we indicated first in Latin America, 
  though this year or maybe in the coming year or two, it's not going to be 
  substantial, but we would like to move into more sales in Latin America 
  that's what we thought, especially indicating in special item.
  And of course for us as you may remember Female Healthcare is very important 
  in our business. We managed this first quarter to achieve EUR87 million, 
  which is 12% higher. Ex-Grnenthal [indiscernible] (6:14) oral contraceptive 
  [ph] which we bought to the portfolio (6:16) Grunenthal were stable and 
  slightly higher and our new product, original product, Esmya sales were at 
  EUR6.6 million, which we are making progress not just in numbers, but also in
  the extension of the label we achieved that the doctors can use for two 
  cycles and not just one cycle that means three months and then two months 
  rest or break and then another three months or flat three months, it can be 
  used.
  And we are also making progress in the clinical study and we hope to apply 
  for the extension, additional extension of the label in Q3 for so-called 
  long-term on-off which hopefully will indicate that maybe who likes to avoid 
  surgery can use this product, original product of ours, even more times than 
  is necessary. So that is basically was a quick update and then I'll pass it 
  on to Katalin.

  Katalin rdg:
  Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to give you a brief overview of some of our 
  financial items.
  The group reported HUF55.5 billion gross profit in the reported period, which
  represents a 1.1% year-on-year increase when compared to the HUF54.9 billion 
  gross profit, which was the recorded figure in the base period, so we can say
  that the gross profit remains virtually unchanged year-on-year. The group's 
  gross margin was 62.7% when compared to the 64% gross margin, which was the 
  recorded figure in the base period. The negative impact of the decline in 
  sales both in Russia and in Ukraine and also the devaluation of the ruble 
  exchange rate and a higher than average increase of wholesale and retail 
  sales [indiscernible] (8:33-8:38) by the positive impact of the increasing 
  sales in the EU15 countries and the U.S. and in other CIS region, and also 
  the weakening of the forint-euro exchange rate.
  Sales and marketing costs increased slightly by 1.7% year-on-year that 
  represented 30.7% of sales in the reported period. Amortization of the 
  acquired oral contraceptive portfolio represented 1.2% of sales. Therefore, 
  the adjusted sales and marketing costs were about 29.5% of sales level.
  Administrative and general expenses decreased by 5.9% on a year-on-year, 
  primarily due to the cost cutting measures implemented in late 2013.
  Research and development costs increased by 6.8% year-on-year and represented
  13.3% of sales in the reported period. Other income and other expenses 
  decreased to an expense of HUF1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2014, 
  compared to an income of HUF3.1 billion in the first quarter of 2013. A 
  cariprazine related milestone payment was received in the base period while 
  we have not received any milestone payment during the reported period. The 
  other income and other expense item includes claw-back related liabilities in
  the value of HUF671 million with respect to the claw-back regime effective in
  Germany and France and in Spain.
  The group reported HUF10.3 billion operating profit in the first quarter of 
  2014, which represents a substantial 32.5% year-on-year decline when compared
  to the HUF15.2 billion operating profit, which was the recorded figure in the
  base period. The significant year-on-year decline was due to the decreasing 
  gross margins, the lack of any milestone payments, also the negative balance 
  of other income and other expense lines and the increasing R&D expenses.
  The group reported 11.6% operating margin in the reported period when 
  compared to the 17.7% operating margin, which was the recorded figure in the 
  base period.
  Thank you very much for your attention, and I pass it over to Dr. Gbor Gulcsi
  and he is going to talk about the financials.

  Gbor Gulcsi:
  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The next financial result in the first 
  quarter 2014 amounted to have loss of HUF1.2 billion reflecting a decrease of
  HUF5.8 billion when compared to the net financial income of HUF4.6 billion 
  reported in the same period of 2013.
  According to our usual classification, the net financial results can be 
  divided into two parts. Let's start with financial items, which are realized 
  in the cash flow too. Altogether HUF2.8 billion financial gain was accounted 
  on the realized items.
  The net interest income in the first quarter of 2014 amounted to HUF0.6 
  billion as the balance of interest income on our bank deposits and interest 
  expense paid in our respect of our credit facilities. We have also realized 
  HUF2.3 billion exchange gains on trade receivable, trade payables and 
  conversions.
  The other group of the financial items are the items, which are the results 
  of the period and revaluations of the financial assets and liabilities and 
  which are not realized in the cash flow. We accounted HUF4 billion loss on 
  these unrealized items.
  At the end of the first quarter of 2014, we had to book HUF1.6 billion 
  financial loss on the reassessment of the currency-related trade receivables 
  and payables due to the considerable weakening of the Russian ruble. We had 
  to account HUF2 billion financial loss on the revaluation of our 
  euro-denominated borrowings due to the weakening of Hungarian forint that 
  compared to euro.
  And, we had HUF3 billion financial loss on the revaluation of other 
  currency-related items mainly due to the reevaluation of the currency-related
  deferred payments in relation with the PregLem, Chinese, and Mexican 
  acquisitions.
  Finally, at the end of the first quarter, we also revaluated the so-called 
  time value of the remaining deferred payments, liabilities in respect of 
  PregLem, Chinese and Mexican acquisitions and we had to book HUF0.2 billion 
  for financial expense.
  Let me make some remarks on the taxation. In Hungary, we've considered tax 
  allowances into our R&D activities. Five members of the group are subject to 
  the general tax regulation effective in the respective companies. Our 
  guidances for 2014 are the followings.
  Regarding the corporate tax, we expect around 5% effective tax rate because 
  of the mentioned R&D allowance at the parent company. Regarding the sum of 
  the local business tax and innovation fee, we expect that this amount will 
  remain flat or will be only slightly increasing.
  Finally let me explain, why the income and deferred tax item was not a 
  [indiscernible] (14:53) increasing item in this quarter. This is due to the 
  change of the balance sheet of the accounted deferred taxation and 
  liabilities. In this period, the change of the balance sheet of the deferred 
  taxes, assets and liabilities improved the profit by HUF1.1 billion, more 
  than compensating, the customary income tax expenses among amounted HUF0.4 
  billion. This change of the balance sheet was the consequence of the increase
  of the inventories supplied by the parent companies to the subsidiaries and 
  yet not sold to the third parties.
  In the consolidation process, we had to eliminate the so-called intermediate 
  result arrived on the inventories - on these inventories and together with 
  the elimination of this intermediate result, we had to account an opposite 
  movement in the deferred tax item and improvement in the deferred tax balance
  sheet; however, this positive impact on the net results will be only a 
  [indiscernible] (16:21) and when the surplus inventories, as the 
  subsidiaries, will be sold to the third parties, this impact will be 
  [indiscernible] (16:31).
  Let me pass the phone back to Mr. Bogsch.

  Erik Bogsch:
  Thank you very much. So then if I may come back to the forecast, a revision 
  of our forecast which we gave in early February. So in Hungary, no change in 
  the forecast. We expect the sales to be around to same level as last year, so
  no change in it. In Poland, the forecasting sale to 5% growth, because of 
  weak first quarter, our forecast is minus 5% to 0% in local currency in zloty
  terms.
  In Romania, we expect more or less the same level in local currency terms as 
  last year, [indiscernible] (17:24) obviously forecast for our pharmaceutical 
  sales, not including the wholesale and business, which we have especially in 
  Romania where we expect maybe a little bit of growth.
  In the EU9, which is now with addition of Croatia EU10, we expect sales 
  around - to be around the same level as last year. In EU15, the annual 
  forecast that is to say this year is growth 10% to 15% in euro terms. In 
  Russia, in ruble terms, our forecast was 0% to 5% growth. Now our forecast is
  minus 5% in ruble terms. And then I would like to make some comments.
  So we have checked those numbers that available are not, I would say, very 
  reliable but still currently in the first quarter, the Russian market for 
  pharmaceutical was lower than in ruble terms, of course even more so in euro 
  terms, but let's stick to the ruble, so lower than the last year. Maybe there
  was lack of flu season or maybe stocks at the pharmacy levels were high and 
  it seems that it was lower than last year. So in that sense, we may say that 
  - and according to the data that we have, our market share has even improved,
  that is to say there was bigger drop of sales than our [indiscernible] 
  (19:13) as you may remember 5.6%.
  Nevertheless, we felt that the chances of improving, that is to stay why we 
  stick to the minus 5% in ruble terms as everyone asking knows that the GDP 
  came almost close to zero, so that means that most likely that we had an 
  effect on the purchasing power. And we feel nevertheless that the ruble will 
  stabilize at around RUB50 to EUR1. The devaluation was anyway substantial 
  compared to last year, so we expect that this will be stable.
  Nevertheless, that if we translate to our figures that means that in euro 
  terms, it's more than EUR60 million less, even slightly more than that. So 
  that means definitely, that has an effect on our figures as far as, of 
  course, the profit is concerned. I would like to add that we had no payment 
  problems and the [indiscernible] (20:38) the money more or less on time. So 
  that's about Russia.
  Now on Ukraine, as the situation was very shaky already in February, we 
  thought that it's too early to give a forecast. Nevertheless, by end of 
  February or early March, we thought that the situation has got much worse and
  the changes on the political scene can happen pretty fast. When it comes to 
  economy, this is a much more step by step, but definitely [indiscernible] 
  (21:18). Therefore, we passed and of course, at that stage one could see that
  there will be an impact on other companies mainly on Russia, which is 
  practically the exchange rate and the GDP growth.
  So, currently, hryvnia, Ukrainian currency, which is linked to the U.S. 
  dollar, is around 30% lower than it was in early part of this year. And 
  honestly, we fear that most likely there would be additional devaluation, 
  when and to what extent of course that's very difficult to foresee. This very
  uncertain environment had a very negative impact of this high uncertainty on 
  all involved in the chain, that is to say be it the wholesalers or the 
  pharmacies. And of course, the purchasing power is decreasing as the prices 
  are increasing in the local currency terms. So that's why our forecast 
  currently is minus 35% in dollar terms in Ukraine, and though there are low 
  stocks at the wholesalers and even some shortage at the pharmacy levels 
  because most of the pharmacies have to pay in advance to get goods from the 
  wholesaler, but nevertheless we fear that this environment is not going to 
  change in the coming month even probably this year.
  We have to also consider that we deliver only goods so that we have avoid 
  shortages. The Hungarian agency, who was giving us some sort of insurance, 
  have stopped continuing this insurance on our [indiscernible] (23:27) from 
  the 20th of February [indiscernible] (23:31) before obviously we still have 
  their insurance and in some - in most cases - we have some bank guarantees in
  Ukrainian banks, but therefore our exposure in the [indiscernible] 
  (23:41-23:47), but to what extent this can be if necessary materialized, it's
  a bit questionable.
  Never [ph] drastic (23:57) more than I think. So therefore we feel that this 
  year and maybe in the coming year depending of course on outcome of the 
  political situation including the election [indiscernible] (24:11) elections,
  it's simply too early to make a comment on that. So continuing on the latest 
  about the forecast on the other CIS republics, we expect 5% to 10% growth in 
  dollar terms.
  In the U.S. still - for the full year, we expect 10% to 15% drop in dollar, 
  of course in dollar term, we do not expect any change that rest of the world.
  In China, we expect some growth. Our forecast is 40 million for this year. 
  And of course talking about our Female Healthcare, we expect that portfolio 
  of oral contraceptive both on Grnenthal will be around the same level as last
  year and Esmya as we indicated, no change. It should be around 30 million for
  the full year.
  If we talk about the margins then I would like to mention that of course - 
  sorry, that means that, all together, of course especially indicating the 
  drop in euro terms in Russia is substantial. All together, we expect that in 
  euro terms the sales will be about 5% to 6% lower than last year. Of course, 
  a lot will depend on the exchange rate between the different currencies. But 
  after all the [ph] duty cost (25:52) and local currency in euro 
  [indiscernible] (25:54), I think because euro is more important for 
  [indiscernible] (25:57).
  Then, of course, we have to see what we can do on this sharp drop - about a 
  sharp drop in, maybe let's talk about the operating profits. So obviously, as
  far as the sales are concerned, here we have to try to do everything to 
  minimize the drop of sales industry in Ukraine. I think our sales force is 
  working hard, but if necessary some cuts will be there, be it personnel or 
  cuts in the salaries. We shall try to also lower the costs [ph] relating 
  (26:48) to sales and marketing. Equally in some parts of Central Eastern 
  Europe, we are looking for some cuts in almost every country. And of course 
  on the positive side, we have to push more increasing sales in the EU15 and 
  in the new markets, be it China or - not probably this year, but later, Latin
  America, that is to say try to diversify little bit of our sales [ph] as far 
  as (27:23) geographically is concerned.
  Coming back of course that we have to try to cut expenses across almost in 
  every area, I mentioned already the sales and marketing that there we have to
  cut. Some of the cuts, they're effective and I think these are already seen 
  in the first quarter where our sales and marketing was 30.7%, which is 
  slightly lower than our forecast, which was 31.5%. We hope that it should be 
  below the 31% for the full year. Of course, it does depend on the top line 
  too, because it's the percentage of the top line cost. But overall, we have 
  to cut those expenses year-on-year to come to a lower figure step-by-step. 
  And in some areas of course, we may have to take some drastic action.
  As far as the R&D is concerned, in the first quarter, we were 13.3%; our 
  forecast was 13%. Definitely, we have some ongoing clinical trials, which we 
  [ph] chart (28:38) depending our forecast for this year, it's 13%, but 
  definitely we are looking how to cut that and not very likely it's going to 
  happen because as I said ongoing clinical trials, which we have to finish 
  that hopefully by next year.
  So we are also evaluating some of the processes that we have, how we can 
  achieve on cost cutting in several areas. So that means that as I mentioned 
  our forecast for this year is similar or slightly lower because of sales 
  figures than originally planned, which is 11%, [ph] that earlier it was 
  (29:31) 12% to 13%. So our forecast for the full year operating margin is 
  currently 11%.
  So that was a bit of about the forecast and some of the action steps we are -
  we have taken and we shall take in the future. And now we are ready for 
  questions.

Q&A

  Operator:
  We will now take our first question from Jamie Clark of Bank of America. 
  Please go ahead, your line is open.

  <Q - Jamie D. Clark>: Hey, good afternoon. Three questions, please. Firstly 
  on the U.S. sales, first quarter 2013 was a low base, which has driven very 
  high growth in the first quarter this year, what are you expecting? You are 
  still expecting sales to be flat to down over the course of the year? I mean,
  is there a possibility that you have faster growth in timely ones which can 
  more than offset this [indiscernible] (30:42) reductions.
  And secondly on your Latin American business, you haven't given a forecast 
  there for the full year. Can you just give us an idea about where you expect 
  that to go and what the long-term potential of that could be please?
  And then thirdly just on your gross margin. I'm not sure if you said where 
  you're expecting your gross margin to be for the full year, [indiscernible] 
  (31:02) you could tell us. Thank you.

  <A - Erik Bogsch>: As far as the gross margin is concerned, we should be 
  around the same figure, as we indicated, 62%, I have - sorry, I haven't 
  repeated that, there is no change from the current [indiscernible] (31:20), 
  so actually about 61% to 62%, [indiscernible] (31:23).
  Now, as far as the U.S. is concerned, we still stick to the minus 10% to 15%,
  because I think that there will be more competition on the emergency pill, 
  there seems to be a more competition on Plan B OneStep, which means that this
  - the first quarter probably was better than the coming quarter. Of course, 
  it's a bit too early to say.
  As far as the U.S. is concerned, I would like to add cariprazine situation. 
  Of course, there are restrictions that I'm sure you understand because of - 
  our partner is Forest. Nevertheless, we feel that there was already a 
  discussion, a meeting with the FDA. We feel that Forest people and the 
  experts and our people [ph] attempted (32:21) reasonably well our case and 
  there is a strong likelihood that there will be no additional clinical trials
  expected from us.
  That does not mean that the ongoing clinical trials and the launch we had, we
  do not need to present more [ph] feedback (32:41), which I'm sure that Forest
  is doing its best. And I think it's reasonable to expect that those data can 
  be presented in the last quarter, that is to say Q4 of this year, which [ph] 
  would be (32:57) in the best case scenario in middle of next year. There is a
  chance, [indiscernible] (33:03), there is a chance that for the two 
  indications, that is the schizophrenia and the bipolar mania that there is a 
  chance that FDA may grant the approval for cariprazine.
  So then, there was a question on Latin America. I think currently the sales 
  are simply too small for this year. So I would not like to give you a 
  forecast at this stage. As far as in the coming years are concerned, of 
  course, it's going to be a step-by-step process. We shall keep you updated. 
  And if you depend mainly on how we can - [ph] let them build, let me 
  architect that those (33:46) to some of those countries, but we shall keep 
  you updated.

  <Q - Jamie D. Clark>: Okay. Thank you.

  Operator:
  We will now take our next question from Vladimira Urbankova of Erste Bank. 
  Please go ahead. Your line is open.

  <Q - Vladimira Urbankova>: Thank you very much. Congratulations to results in
  very difficult environment. I would have two basic questions. As far as 
  cariprazine concerns, I would like to get updated on the ongoing trials for 
  the intended EU approval. How far you are and what is the expected timeline? 
  Because, right now, it is somehow linked to the U.S., so maybe if you can 
  give me some first indications when potentially the product could be in 
  market if you're still planning to partner, is there any development on this 
  side?
  Also on that R&D side, if - when we will hear maybe some more news on 
  [indiscernible] (34:42)? When I looked into from old historical records, I 
  noticed that it's about time to announce, maybe some first clinical trials to
  be initiated this year.
  And then thirdly, if I am looking at Russian situation, how does that affect 
  your plans to expand your manufacturing presence there? How [indiscernible] 
  (35:06), and yeah some more update about your investments?

  <A - Erik Bogsch>: Yes. May I start first with Russia, that on the 
  investments we are about to finish during the course of this year, that means
  that we can more than double, make it triple our production. I think it is 
  very, very likelihood that there will be advantages for the local 
  manufacturing, I think, in this current environment to what extent and which 
  type of product most likely, of course if [ph] we're doing the standard 
  (35:48) business. So, I think it's important that we increase our 
  manufacturing unit and that does not require now any addition, substantially 
  it's in our expense. But, if necessary, of course we can even expand more if 
  things could go in that direction.
  But we feel that already the local sales are increasing - local sorry meaning
  that manufactured product, which we manufacture locally because of - there is
  more product, which have advantages manufactured locally or more channels to 
  say. On [indiscernible] (36:33) and EU, yes there is a long-term study 
  required by the European team. We hope that it will be finished probably 
  first quarter of next quarter. And that will enable us to present either in 
  Q1 of 2016, or very, very late of next year. But I would rather say Q1 of 
  2016 for the Europe and also it is. There is also trial ongoing for the 
  differentiation of the product compared to others, which is linked to the 
  so-called negative symptoms. That is we expect to be finished equally around 
  the first quarter or second quarter of next year.
  So with the data that we generated and the trials at the stage, we may 
  consider look for a partner in EU, but currently there is a - we haven't 
  really started that, it may start in the coming months and we should see 
  whether - we can achieve some reasonably good conditions. But there is no 
  hurry because that means that even if you present in the Q1, products, you 
  will not be able to put to the market before early 2017 that situation. On 
  the biosimilars, yes, we started some clinical trials on PEG-G-CSF that's 
  ongoing that may take a year-and-half, so that means that we hope to have 
  some results in the middle of next year, which is to say, 2015. And on the 
  others, we are also preparing for - to start clinical trials most likely, 
  late this year or early next year.

  <Q - Vladimira Urbankova>: Thank you.

  <A - Erik Bogsch>: Thank you.

  Operator:
  We will now take our next question from Simon Mather of Barclays. Please go 
  ahead, your line is open.

  <Q - Simon Mather>: Hi. Thanks. I have got four questions or so, please if I 
  could. Just on, firstly on the R&D expenses, you've talked about potential 
  cost cutting, you've given guidance for this year for R&D expense 
  [indiscernible] (39:23) sales. We've also laid out the plans for these trials
  ending Q1 and Q2 next year and then biosimilars kicking in. I mean you are in
  a position to potentially give us any longer-term guidance for where we 
  should be modeling R&D expenses as a percentage of sales going forward or 
  even on an absolute level, should we expect a decline in absolute terms, all 
  staying steady? That's the first question.
  Second question on sales and marketing expenses. I think I remember full-year
  results, you discussed the requirement to increase sales force in Russia to 
  try and grow ahead of the market there and then now today, you've talked 
  about looking for potentially cost cutting in Russia or be it headcounts or 
  lowering the wages. I'm just wondering what potential impact you believe that
  could have in longer term and if this is really the way to go, or whether or 
  not you believe in hindsight increasing of the sales force in Russia was 
  probably not the correct thing to do. I am just wondering if you could give 
  an update on the status of the long term on and off trial when we should 
  expect that to read out potential filing of that data, please. The fourth, 
  just on biosimilar R&D expense, can you just help to remind me as how much is
  going to be financed? Is it going to be you spending in R&D expenses 
  yourself?
  Are you going to be sharing with STADA? Could you just remind us that? And 
  then I guess the final question is, given the slowdown in the top line and 
  the dynamics currently in the marketplace, I mean, are you potentially 
  looking at utilizing the balance sheet to try and acquire products and 
  companies in the near term and if so what areas are you potentially looking? 
  Thank you.

  <A - Erik Bogsch>: Yes. Let's start with the last one. Yes, we are obviously 
  looking forward to acquire product, first of all for the gynecological area 
  in the Female Healthcare. That is absolute top priority of ours, try to 
  acquire products or projects at the late stage. On the biosimilars in some 
  products, yes there is a agreement with STADA which means that we can pay 
  some royalty or some milestones depending on the progress that something and 
  anyway partnering is important, be it on biosimilars or equally on some other
  projects that we may have.
  On Esmya, the forecast hasn't changed as we expect to apply during the Q3 or 
  this year for the long-term on-off. And in the best case - and most likely, I
  think the best case scenario that we may get approval in Q2 of next year, 
  which we mean that we can launch, not a launch [indiscernible] (42:21) that 
  from then, it means of course 60 days, that could mean Q3, but that we mean 
  also that we have to negotiate with the price with also in some countries, in
  most of the countries I would say.
  In the sales and marketing, yes, we expected that we shall increase the sales
  force. We are not going to extend the sales force. We should stay where we 
  are, currently that means that there is no additional expense on that. And of
  course, we do not forget that though the ruble was - has been ruble versus 
  the euro, that means that our marketing expenses are all in ruble in Russia. 
  That means they are also in ruble, so in that sense that has to be deducted 
  if I may say from the sales index sense, which is around 27% or 28% of our 
  sales in Russia.
  On the R&D expense part, the point is that as far as if you take out the 
  clinical trials, we have not increased the expenses, even we cut here and 
  there of the expense for the clinical trials, which are - had to be finished 
  [indiscernible] (43:51) on not only this year, but maybe for - at least for 
  the first part of next year as far as the [ph] cost-cutting (44:00) is 
  concerned and the biosimilars will kick in probably next year more than this 
  year. So we are looking how to partner that is to say how we can bring down 
  the R&D expense to the level, it should be around 12%. That is our aim and 
  not to exceed the 12% in two years, three years' time maximum.

  <Q - Simon Mather>: Okay. All right. Thank you.

  <A - Erik Bogsch>: Thanks.

  Operator:
  We will now take our next question from Akos Kuti of Equilor Investment Ltd. 
  Please go ahead, your line is open.

  <Q - Akos Kuti>: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Just a 
  quick one regarding Forest, we heard that it has been recently acquired by 
  Actavis and I'm wondering if there has been any approach from Actavis to you 
  regarding the cariprazine developments. Will the situation remain as it is or
  do you expect any change in the cooperation with Forest, Actavis in upcoming 
  months?

  <A - Erik Bogsch>: We are sure that we've have very good contacts with 
  Actavis too that whenever it happens and that is approved and Actavis take 
  over Forest, then there will be no change and they will do, I mean, the group
  and the people there will do their best to continue the same way as they are 
  doing now. I think I may say that cariprazine is one of the top priorities. 
  So we are not concerned that there is going to be any change.

  <Q - Akos Kuti>: Okay. Thank you very much.

  Operator:
  We will now take our next question from Guillaume Van Renterghem of UBS. 
  Please go ahead, your line is open.

  <Q - Guillaume T. Van Renterghem>: Yeah. How are you? Guillaume Van 
  Renterghem from UBS. Three quick questions, the first one is on - in the U.S.
  I'm just wondering if your partner [indiscernible] (46:01) is about to start 
  a Phase III in, I mean, a long term study or they are just doing there one of
  the three months and other three months again? So second question is on the 
  as you know the FDA issued a few days ago the guidance against going for 
  surgery for uterine fibroids.
  I am just wondering if you are aware of any discussion on the [indiscernible]
  (46:24) to issue a similar guidance. And I'm just wondering as well on tag 
  pricing in the US, you said that you're pretty sure that you wouldn't need 
  [indiscernible] (46:35) but Forest was very clear and they clearly said on 
  their call that they don't need that they will file actually without an 
  additional trial by the end of the year. So can you confirm that? Thank you.

  <A - Erik Bogsch>: I only can confirm that all the data by Forest most likely
  presented in the last quarter. As far the Esmya is concerned, our partner is 
  Actavis and they're moving ahead with the trial, that's all I can say. And 
  sorry I didn't catch exactly your second point about uterine fibroids.

  <Q - Guillaume T. Van Renterghem>: Yeah. On 17th of March - no, sorry, 17th 
  of April, the FDA issued a guidance for uterine fibroid advising against 
  going for surgery because actually with the specific technique actually 
  because of the risk of increased cancer, uterine cancer, if the European EMEA
  is talking about that or not?

  <A - Erik Bogsch>: That honestly what EMEA is doing, we have no knowledge. We
  are aware of what you mentioned about FDA. But I think that that's lead to 
  the [indiscernible] (47:49) if they take action.

  <Q - Guillaume T. Van Renterghem>: Okay. Thank you.

  <A - Erik Bogsch>: And we have time for one more question.

  Operator:
  There are no further questions in the queue at this time sir.

  Erik Bogsch:
  Okay. Thanks very much. Then I would like to thank you all for participating 
  in today's conference call. And obviously if you have any additional 
  questions, feel free to contact Katalin Ordog and she will try to give you 
  the proper answer. So thanks very much for participating and all the best to 
  you. Thanks very much. Bye, bye.

  Operator:
  Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you 
  for your participation, you may now disconnect.

Wire: Perspektiva (PRS) Date: May 7 2014  10:11:43
PERSPEKTIVA Research: Notes from the LJSE Investment Conference

LKPG:
Composite margin across all segments remains stable and may even
slightly increase with the new capacities in the TEU terminal as
the TEU margin is the highest among all segments. 1Q14 results
were above expectations, however company’s forecast sticks with
a plan. The dredging project is still underway and the new
deadline for completion is the end of the year. Expected 2014
CAPEX is EUR 40m and will be mainly used for dredging project,
new cranes and the extension of docking pier on TEU terminal.
Once completed, the capacity will be up to 1 mio TEUs per year
from current 750k. The railway connection with hinterland is
still not fully electrified after February’s ice storm. Diesel
trains are used instead and no bottlenecks appear atm. It is
expected that the railway electrification will be fixed in six
months. The company expects no additional write-offs in real
estate and other investments as they have been revalued in the
past to fair values. Rather than impairments, we can expect some
positive news from the sale of these investments (sale of the
stake in Romanian port of Arad may be completed soon). 
 
ZVTG:
Expectations on 2014 GWP in SLO are to stay flat, while
predictions for the SEE region is slight growth. On poor
performing CZK unit ZVTG is still deciding what to do, either to
change business model and be a niche player or to pull out from
the market. In CRO, the government lifted regulated insurance
margins, which has caused new erosion of market margins
especially on the vehicle segment. Management proposed dividend
EUR 1,1 or 30% payout ratio. On the potential Serbian DDOR
insurance purchase, there is no activity at the moment. 
 
PETG:
Geoplin 33% stake is evaluated @ EUR 98m. The Geoplin operations
are considered to be stable even after renewal of the long term
supply contracts with lower prices. The potential agreement
between AUT and RUS on new gas route avoiding SLO may be
negative for Geoplin’s future growth prospects, but current
operations as main wholesale gas supplier should be stabile. The
expected liberalization of margins is delayed after SLO
political crisis and after there were progressive talks with the
government to lift regulation. If margin regulation is gone,
PETG expects 1,5c per liter which translates into EUR 18m on
EBITDA. Electricity division should grow additionally this year
from 5TWh to 8TWh. Currently electricity division has 33k retail
accounts. CRO operations as second biggest are expected to start
showing financial effects after completion of merger between
Petrol CRO and Europetrol. It is expected the company will add
EUR 2m each year in net income (now EUR 2,1m) for several years.
The supplementary goods sales growth has continued in CRO (1Q14:
15% YoY). The fast growing wholesale business is this year on
the same qty level as last year and a bit lower on margin. 
 
KRKG: 
In UKR the situation stays as before crises, but with no
guarantees for the future. The bulk of sales represent the
troubled eastern UKR. There are problems with one customer but
nothing irregular and there is a 5-6 days delay for EUR/UAH
conversion (before crisis this was done in 1 day). How the
potential EU sanctions would affect KRKG operations in RUS is
not clear. The very distant comparison is Iran where Krka had a
good growth rate, but sanctions were getting tighter and the
market eventually stagnated. FX loss in 1Q may be same as last
year as EUR/RUB depreciated further 10% in1Q14. Payment
discipline is roughly the same, but varies across market, with
the worst being in the SEE. In RUS client base is consolidating
and KRKG is trying to sell to biggest counterparties covering
all regions in the country. On CAPEX, the bulk substances
factory in SLO will be completed by the end of the year. The new
company is important for Krka in order to preserve the stability
of bulk substances supply especially as this market started to
be very volatile in recent years. Some bulk substance producers
have been forced to shut down due to US FDA requirements, while
some have been taken over by global drug companies, which makes
them difficult to sell bulk products on the market. 
 
GRVG:
EUR 20m of savings are expected after relocation of production.
EUR 5m have been showed in the 1Q14. The company will also need
less working capital due to better optimization of inventory.
The expected EBITDA is EUR 94m (last year EUR 78m). In UKR 1Q14
sales dropped significantly revealing no numbers (last year EUR
50m sales). The main sales region in EUR is troubled eastern
part. In RUS, sales continue to perform well, but the problem is
EUR/RUB depreciation hence prices are changed few times per
year. Some counter FX gains may come from the potential
depreciation of of  RSD to EUR as key Gorenje’s production for
RUS is based in Serbia, which also has trade union with RUS.
Gorenje has also reorganized its sales network, reduced FRA and
TUR team, moved SLK sales to CZE, and covering all Scandinavia
from DEN.

Krka: Results below our expectations as net profit was affected by FX differences.

Sales revenues increased by only 1.2% YoY however operating expenses stagnated
therefore operating margins actually expanded. EBITDA margin increased YoY and
QoQ in 1Q14 and amounted to 29.1%. On the other hand FX results deteriorated
overall picture. Namely net income dropped by 17.2% as a consequence. Management
commented they believe worst is over and we are for now keeping our 2014
estimates intact. With it target price and recommendation also remain intact.

[Delayed] Wood Flash - Krka: blowout quarter in Russia (+44% in RUB terms!)

This story was delayed by 20 days. See {WUCO<GO>} to subscribe to real-time
delivery.

Krka had a blowout first quarter in Russia, with sales rising 20% in EUR or 44%
in RUB terms, which boiled down to the advantages afforded by the new RUS II
production and logistics plant – a key part of our positive view on the
company – and its success in repricing drugs to offset the weaker RUB. This,
and efficiency measures taken in 1H13, helped to deliver a 21.1% EBIT margin, or
9.5ppts better than its peer Richter. 1Q sales excluding Russia contracted by 5%
– a reminder of how tough regional generics markets are – but we still
believe that this quarter again validates Krka’s vertically-integrated,
volume-driven business model. We are not changing our outlook for only
single-digit earnings growth this year (excluding the EUR 21m award from
AstraZenica that Krka won in April), but we still see upside from: 1) multiples
expansion as liquidity and free float among foreign investors is growing; 2) the
cancellation of c.7.4% treasury shares in July and the renewal of buybacks; with
optionality on 3) a M&A trigger (Krka’s balance sheet has been debt free from
3Q13). The stock trades at a 2014-15E PER of 10.7x and EV/EBITDA of 5.8x – 15%
and 30% discounts to its peers, respectively, and we are BUYers, with a PT of
EUR 77.5/share. 
Takeaways from the conference call 
Management cited several reasons for this quarter’s outstanding sales in
Russia, which boil down to the advantages afforded by the new RUS II
production/logistics plant and its success in repricing drugs:
Of the c.20% RUB devaluation since 1Q13, management says it has been able to
claw back half of this through higher RUB prices.
Starting this year, the price bonus for domestic producers in state tenders has
increased to 15% from 10% and, thanks to new production capacities, Krka is
increasing its tender sales.
Logistical advantages: the new logistics centre puts its products closer to its
customers and, especially during periods of peak demand, Krka can promise
deliveries to customers several days sooner than when it shipped directly from
Slovenia, for instance.
New sales teams covering pharmacies, new product launches.
Krka does not guide on individual markets, only to say that it expects slower
growth this year than the c.25% pace in 2012-13, but still growth (we expect 14%
growth in RUB terms, which is c.2% in EUR terms at the current exchange rate).
In Ukraine, management says the situation is pretty stable, Krka is receiving
and filling orders more or less as usual and, unless the situation deteriorates,
it does not expect a “substantial decrease” of sales yoy (we expect sales to
contract 5% in USD). The word back from its c.350 med reps is that lower
purchasing power is hurting demand for durables, but not for pharmaceuticals.
Exchanging payments in UAH for USD takes longer, but is still doable.
Margins benefited from efficiency measures (renegotiating raw material and
service contracts) implemented in 1H13 and so, to a large extent, are
sustainable (we expect the gross margin to fall 0.7% yoy and an EBIT margin of
17.5%).
Krka to book a c.EUR 21m award for damages and legal costs (c.10% of our FY
pre-tax profit) for the esomprazole case it won against AstraZeneca (in April)
later this year. This month, it lost a similar case vs. AstraZeneca in Norway
for c.EUR 1.9m, which was provisioned for in 4Q13.
M&A: despite suggestions in February to the contrary, Krka still cannot report
any success in finding a target to help it accelerate growth in overseas markets
or new drug indications (women’s health, oncology, or non-insulin adjunct
treatments for diabetes). Valuations are very demanding.
No comment on what the company will propose for its treasury shares (7.42% on 30
April) at this year’s AGM; it will publish its proposal on 2 June. We note
that its buyback authority (up to 10%) ends in July (we expect a proposal to
extend the buyback and – inasmuch as it seems no acquisitions are imminent –
to cancel existing treasury shares).
Of the EUR 14m FX loss in 1Q, about half (EUR 7-8m) has already been reversed.
1Q14 results review 
Krka’s 1Q net profit of EUR 42.5m beat our forecast by 14% thanks to an
excellent performance in Russia: sales in the company’s largest market grew
44% yoy in RUB terms, handily beating its regional peers (Richter -6%, Stada
+4%). The gross margin was a better-than-expected 59.7% (we had 58.3%), despite
the weak RUB and cold & flu season, and opex was 2% lower. The bottom line would
have been better if not for the EUR 14m financial loss (we expected EUR 7.2m)
driven by the RUB devaluation.
Russia/CIS (39% of sales): Krka delivered outstanding, 44%, growth in Russia (we
expected 10%) to RUB 4.03bn (+20% to EUR 84.6m), or c.30% of our full-year
target; wholesaler destocking, cited by its peers, apparently did not affect
Krka’s business after launching its new production and distribution centre
last autumn. In Ukraine, flat yoy sales (in USD terms) of EUR 13.2m validated
management’s confidence that its commercial team can manage the downturn in
that market.
Western Europe (c.20% of sales) fell 8% yoy to EUR 59.8m on the company’s
decision to reduce sales through third-party channels, mainly in France, Italy
and Germany; sales through its own subsidiaries, though, rose 29% yoy.
CEE sales (21% of total) declined 2% yoy to EUR 62.1m. Poland (c.50% of region)
grew by 4% (in PLN terms) to EUR 31.5m and was the only stable market for Krka
this quarter. Hungarian sales doubled yoy after key products lost reimbursement
last year; on the other hand, Czech sales collapsed c.70% on price cuts (the
main miss in our forecasts). Slovakia grew 26%, other markets contracted 9%.
Sales in Slovenia (7% of total) continue to fall; this quarter, by 9% to EUR
19.3m. Pharma sales contracted by 14% to EUR 12.4m, but revenues at heath
resorts have begun to stabilise (+5% at EUR 6.8m); Krka renovated several
resorts last spring.
SEE sales (11% of total) were flat yoy at EUR 34.2m: better-then-expected growth
in Romania (+8% yoy in RON) only just offset the declines in Croatia (-7% yoy in
HRK), the FYR and Bulgaria.
This quarter, Krka started reporting overseas markets as a separate line; sales
declined yoy by 36% to EUR 6.5m on a high comparative base and the restrictions
imposed on Iranian pharmaceutical importers (Iran being Krka’s largest Middle
East market).
OTC sales fell 9% yoy due to the weak cold & flu season; regardless, Russian OTC
sales managed 2% growth in EUR (+22% in RUB).
Opex was 2% lower than forecast on a 7% yoy drop in sales costs (24.8% of sales
vs. 27% in the base period); Krka has not cut headcount but benefited from lower
RUB wages for its Russian salesforce. This was partially offset by an increase
in admin costs (6.4% of sales vs. 5.8% in the base period); R&D spend as a share
of sales was flat yoy at 8.5%.
Net financial costs jumped to EUR 14m (vs. a EUR 2.2m gain in the base period)
on a negative EUR 14.2m FX revaluation, driven primarily by RUB devaluation.
About 50% of the loss was realised.

                         Interim Management Statement

 

Hong Kong, 19 November 2013 - Cathay International Holdings Ltd.  (LSE:CTI.L), 
an investment holding company and a leading investor in the growing healthcare
sector in the People's Republic of China ("PRC"), today announces its  Interim 
Management Statement for the period  from 1 July 2013  to 19 November 2013  in 
accordance with FSA Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4.3.

 

Mr. Lee  Jin-Yi,  CEO of  Cathay  International Holdings  Limited,  commented: 
"Cathay remains  focused  on  creating  synergies  across  the  Group  and  on 
expanding its product portfolio in key areas.  We are pleased with  inositol's 
recent progress and will continue to  advance and develop this programme.   We 
remain  positive   about  the   opportunities  within   the  growing   Chinese 
pharmaceutical and healthcare market and for the potential for inositol."

 

Business Update

 

During the period,  Lansen continued its  focus on marketing  and growing  the 
sales of Pafulin, Tuoshu and  Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) in the  rheumatology 
markets  and  has  also  started  to  widen  the  indications  of  Pafulin  in 
dermatology.   The  new  business  development  team  at  Lansen  is  actively 
reviewing a list of drug opportunities for the treatment of autoimmune related
diseases to expand its  current product portfolio.   During the last  quarter, 
Lansen entered into a plant extract supply agreement with Haotian,  continuing 
its strategy  to develop  its  plant extract  business  into a  medical  grade 
supplier of key ingredients for healthcare products, and successfully  secured 
a reliable supply of good quality  plant extract ingredients at a  competitive 
price for  its production  needs.  Lansen  has also  acquired the  misoprostol 
development project from Tianjin Longbai,  which represents an opportunity  to 
invest in the labor  induction market and adds  to its gynaecological  product 
portfolio.  The Company believes that  Lansen's transactions with Haotian  and 
Tianjin Longbai will create business synergies within the Group.

 

As reported in the first half, Haotian began working with corn fluid suppliers
to ensure  the smooth  and continued  supply of  raw materials.   In the  last 
quarter, Haotian has continued to work on improving corn fluid flow and is now
starting to implement the  improved process.  This, along  with the usual  low 
levels of phytin that can be extracted from corn fluid during new corn harvest
season, has affected our phytin yield and supply. Therefore, we have  adjusted 
our target inositol production run rate to 1200 tonnes per annum by the end of
this year.  As corn stem starts to dry, the phytin yield from corn fluid  will 
gradually increase and, coupled with  the implementation of the improved  corn 
fluid flow process, the inositol production run rate should reach 1500  tonnes

Sicorten Plus is used for certain types of skin disease, known as inflammatory skin disease specifically for triclosan-sensitive secondary infection and corticosteroid-responsive dermatitis and eczema diseases. Cathay holds a 50.56% stake in Lansen. Under the terms of an asset purchase agreement, the total cash consideration comprises an upfront payment of US$8.0 million, plus additional milestone payments of a total maximum US$1.5 million, linked to future sales of Sicorten Plus in the PRC achieved by Lansen. Lansen has paid Novartis the upfront payment, at completion on 28 March 2014, of US$8.0 million. Sicorten Plus is approved in the PRC for the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive skin diseases such as seborrheic dermatitis, localised neurodermatitis and nummular eczema. Sicorten Plus is established in the market and is well recognized by clinicians as a treatment for triclosan-sensitive secondary infection and corticosteroid-responsive dermatitis and eczema diseases. The acquisition of Sicorten Plus further strengthens Lansen's position in the dermatology field in the PRC, an area which offers significant growth potential and complements Lansen's leading position in the rheumatology market. The asset purchase agreement was completed after arm's length negotiations between Lansen and Novartis. Mr. Lee Jin-Yi, Chief Executive Officer of Cathay, commented:"Working with Novartis, a market leader and developer of some of the most innovative drugs in the industry, is another major step forward for us." Lansen's acquisition of this already successful product will complement and broaden Lansen's current dermatology product portfolio in the PRC, which has significant growth potential." -ENDS- For further enquiries, please contact: Cathay International Holdings Limited Eric Siu (Finance Director) Tel: +852 2828 9289 Patrick Sung (Director and Controller) Consilium Strategic Communications About Cathay Cathay International Holdings Limited (LSE: CTI.L), focused on the People's Republic of China ("PRC"), is an investment holding company and a leading investor in the growing healthcare sector in the PRC.

“EURO-MED Laboratories Philippines, Inc. said it is determined to hold on to
its market share lead in medical supplies amid expectations of growing demand
in the coming years.

On the sidelines of the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting yesterday,
Euro-Med Senior Vice-President Jose A. Emeterio said revenue in 2014 is
projected to increase by 4%, with net income growing 10%.

He said the company’s subsidiaries, Hemotek Renal Center, Inc. and CafeFrance
Corp., are expected to lead the growth.

. . . .

‘If we can have at least 5% of the projected 10% yearly increase in the demand
for IV fluids, that is enough,’ he said.

The firm recently sold its Mandaluyong plant and transferred all production to
an existing complex in Cavite.

With this move, it expect production capacity for large volume parenterals
solutions to increase by 20 million units to 74 million units.

Mr. Emeterio said among its products, IV fluids remain the biggest contributor
in terms of revenue with around 60%.

IV fluids for export also accounts for about 10-11% of total sales.

The company currently exports to member-countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, as well as some parts of South America.

Mr. Emeterio said the company is working on fully developing the market in
South America, while plans to enter the United Arab Emirates market are
underway.”

  With that said, now I am pleased to present, Mr. David Gao, Chairman and CEO 
  of China Biologic Products. David, please go ahead.

  David Xiaoying Gao, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:
  Thank you, Bill. Hello, everyone and welcome to China Biologic's first 
  quarter 2014 conference call. We're pleased to start off 2014 with a strong 
  first quarter. Total sales increased 4.1% to US$56.3 million, in spite of 
  strong financial performance in the prior year period as well as a temporary 
  production suspension of Guizhou Taibang's plasma production during this 
  period.
  During the quarter, our Shandong facility maintained strong sales growth 
  momentum, and our Guizhou facility experienced a 37% of sales decrease due to
  the production suspension, which was in line with our internal forecast. Our 
  plasma collection volume continued to grow as planned. Our operating margin 
  and net margin of the first quarter of 2014 reached 49.7% and 32.5% 
  respectively, representing a year-on-year improvement. This solid growth was 
  primarily attributable to strong market demand, especially for our human 
  albumin products, stable products pricing in a more profitable product mix, 
  improved plasma utilization efficiency, as Bill adds, effective cost control 
  measures. As we've stated in previous quarters, we had ongoing concerns about
  albumin import volume and its impact on product pricing. During the reporting
  quarter, we observed (inaudible) decline overall albumin import volume in 
  spite of generally strong market demand. Consequently, we experienced modest 
  growth in both price and sales volume of albumin for the reporting quarter.
  We continue to closely monitor market trends and we adjust our pricing and 
  the product shipment accordingly in coming quarters. During the reporting 
  quarter, human albumin products and IVIG products remained our two largest 
  sales contributors, while other products also experienced positive 
  developments. We experienced modest growth in both price and the sales volume
  of albumin products.
  For our higher-margin, hyper-immune products, in particular, human rabies 
  immunoglobulin products, our overall market share continues to grow and we 
  experienced strong growth (Technical Difficulty) immunoglobulin products 
  increased to 12% of total sales from 2% in the same quarter of 2013.
  We attribute this success to our R&D efforts in the last year, which improved
  vaccination practices on specialty plasma collection and production yields. 
  As a result, we increased the supply of rabies vaccinated plasma and expanded
  their production in our Shandong subsidiaries since the second half of 2013.
  Additionally, sales of human coagulation factor VIII continued to ramp up, 
  which further improved our plasma utilization efficiency. For our non-plasma 
  products, thanks to the recent remodeling of our placenta polypeptide 
  production line, sales volume of placenta polypeptide increased by 21% 
  year-over-year in the first quarter of 2014 and we expect production volume 
  to continue to rise in the coming quarters.
  As for our operational developments, Guizhou Taibang received GMP 
  certification for its placenta polypeptide production facility in January and
  GMP certification for its plasma production in March. Our Guizhou Taibang 
  facility has since resumed production with increased production capacity.
  We also began commercial production of human prothrombin complex concentrate 
  at Guizhou Taibang. With these updates, we expect more products available for
  sales in the second half of 2014. We are confident that we can enhance our 
  total sales and operating efficiency to meet growing market demand. We expect
  the growth momentum we saw in the first quarter to accelerate in the 
  following quarters.
  Finally, at the non-operational level, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of 
  common stock from Ms. Siu Ling Chan, an individual shareholder of the 
  company, at a total consideration of US$70 million in February 2014. Through 
  this action, we continue to enhance our shareholding structure and increase 
  shareholder value.
  I will now turn the call over to Ming Yang, our Vice President to review 
  fourth quarter financial results. Ming, please go ahead.

  Ming Yang, Chief Financial Officer:
  Thank you, David and hello, everyone. Let me first review key P&L items for 
  the first quarter 2014. Total sales were $56.3 million, an increase of 4.1% 
  from the same quarter of 2013. Excluding foreign exchange translation effect,
  the increase was primarily due to the increased sales at Shandong Taibang, 
  partially offset by the reduced sales at Guizhou Taibang due to its 
  production suspension during such period.
  During the first quarter, human albumin products and IVIG products remained 
  largest two sales contributors. While the sales volume of human albumin 
  products increased during the first quarter as a result of increased sales 
  volume at Shandong Taibang. The sales volume of IVIG products decreased 
  during this period primarily due to the planned production suspension at 
  Guizhou Taibang during such period.
  As a percentage of total sales, human albumin product revenue accounted for 
  42.3% while IVIG revenue accounted for 36.5%. In addition, during the 
  reporting period, sales of rabies immunoglobulin products grew significantly 
  accounting for 12% of total sales. Sales contribution from placenta 
  polypeptide products and human coagulation factor VIII products was 4.7% and 
  2% respectively. Gross profit was up by 3% reaching $38.6 million. Gross 
  margin remained relatively stable at a 68.5% and 69.2% for the first quarter 
  of 2014 and 2013 respectively. As stated earlier, our gross margin will face 
  pressure from increased plasma collection cost and we intend to support 
  future margin through increased sales of higher margin products and improve 
  the manufacturing efficiency.
  For the first quarter 2014, selling expenses increased by 24.3% to $2.3 
  million or 4.1% of total sales. The increase was primarily due to the 
  increased sales of placenta polypeptide product shipments, which have higher 
  selling expenses. G&A expenses decreased by 16.9% to $7.2 million or 12.8% of
  total sales. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in expenses 
  associated with share-based compensation as well as the absence of 
  amortization expenses in relation to GMP certificates with respect to the 
  2008 acquisition of Guizhou Taibang in the first quarter of 2014.
  G&A expenses as a percentage of total sales declined to 12.8%, up from 16.1% 
  from the same quarter of 2013. R&D expenses were $1.1 million in the first 
  quarter of 2014, representing an increase of 17.6% from the first quarter of 
  2013. The increase was primarily due to the expenditure paid for certain 
  clinical trial programs and the engagement of external experts for certain 
  pipeline products.
  As a percentage of total sales, R&D expenses accounted for 1.9% compared to 
  1.7% in the same quarter of 2013. Operating income was $28 million [ph], 
  representing an increase of 7.7% from the first quarter of 2013. Operating 
  margin increased to 49.7% from 48.1% in the first quarter of 2013.
  Net income attributable to the company increased by 22.5% to $18.3 million 
  resulting in net margin of 32.5%. Fully diluted net income per share was 
  $0.69. Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to the company was $19.1 
  million or $0.73 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted net income and diluted 
  earnings per share excluded $0.8 million of non-cash employee share-based 
  compensation expenses.
  Now, I would like to turn to the balance sheet and the cash flow items. We 
  ended the first quarter of 2014 with approximately $77.5 million in cash and 
  cash equivalents. Net cash provided by operating activities for the reporting
  period was $11.5 million as compared to $22 million for the same period of 
  2013. The decrease was primarily due to the increase of accounts receivable 
  and inventories and decrease in advance from customers for the first quarter 
  of 2014.
  The increase in accounts receivable was $6.4 million as compared to $3.3 
  million in the same period of 2013. This increase was primarily due to the 
  delay in our shipments of enhanced customers payments for certain batches of 
  products during the first quarter of 2014. This delay was a result of delayed
  inspection and approval by the National Institutes for the Food and Drug 
  Control of such products.
  Additionally, we incurred approximately $2.9 million increase in inventory 
  for the reporting quarter as compared to $0.6 million in the same period of 
  2013, mainly attributable to an increase of raw materials.
  Lastly, the decrease of advance from customers was $1.4 million for the three
  months ended March 31, 2014 as compared to the increase of $1.5 in the same 
  period of 2013. This decrease was primarily due to a lump sum pre-payment 
  made by 30 distributors in the first quarter of 2013 for certain 
  immunoglobulin products, a portion of these products were delivered during 
  the three months ended March 31, 2014, upon which the corresponding 
  prepayment was recognized as sales.
  Net cash provided by investing activities was $0.9 million, net cash used in 
  financing activity was $78.2 million. Our working capital on March 31, 2014 
  was $149 million [ph] and our current ratio was 2.84 [ph]. Total 
  shareholders' equity was $256 million as of March 31, 2014 compared with $304
  million as of December 31, 2013. We believe that the company has sufficient 
  cash on hand and can continue to generate positive cash inflow from existing 
  operations. We aim to optimize our balance sheet as we progress throughout 
  the year.
  And now to our financial forecast, our outlook for the remainder of the year 
  is strong and we reiterate our full-year financial guidance of total sales in
  the range of $230 million to $240 million and non-GAAP adjusted net income in
  the range $67 million to $69 million. This estimate assumes only organic 
  growth. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions. 
  Operator, we are ready to take questions.

  Operator:
  Moving to our prior year's quarter. We will find actually that SG&A expenses 
  averaged 4 to to.4 there are few reasons the 3rd quarter with particularly 
  helpful. The G&A savings a few factors. Number one is we actually these top 
  expenses share-based compensation expenses. Which was fully amortized by end 
  of this year. So this year we have that stands. Second, we have amortization 
  expense related to the acquisition we made in 2008 that has been fully 
  amortized as well. For the 4th quarter. So we were committed to improving 
  margins. That's what our card, but you know, you know, we can only assume 
  there is all strategies all the things can happen like last year, as you 
  know, we have legal expenses relating to the corporate, you know that defense
  takeover throughout. So we have a more incur more legal expenses. We have a, 
  the strategic litigation spend a lot of these legal expense. So if we sued 
  data expenses or not going to happen, which at this moment. It's hard to 
  predict. I guess we'll find the end of the year or the remaining quarters. We
  again we try to improve the margins, but we cannot tell in the current year 
  SG&A will be the benchmark for the year performance for especially for the 
  selling expenses 0.2, initially more of like promotion and the marketing 
  activities. You the new regions like South we disclosed in our 10-Q we our up
  with new agents Beijing and in Q1, so we might incur more marketing steps as 
  you know, penetrating through that. Hi, Mark. From gas perspective or certain
  more action the thanks. Funding as David just quickly, just what do you 
  expect going forward with the receivables and the inventory situation. Yeah, 
  I think for the

Questions And Answers

  Operator:
  Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator 
  Instructions) And our first question will come from Yi Chen of Aegis Capital.
  Please go ahead.

  Yi Chen, Analyst:
  Hi, thank you for taking my questions. My first question is, can you explain 
  the sales dynamics between human rabies immunoglobulin and IVIG and what the 
  sales numbers on these two products look likely going forward?

  David Xiaoying Gao, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:
  Okay. The IVIG and hyper-immune products such as rabies immunoglobulin belong
  to the one category of products or immunoglobulin products. The products -- 
  production volumes of our IVIG products depends primarily on the general 
  plasma supply. And secondly, on the allocation of production capacity among 
  human immunoglobulin products, which, including IVIG and other hyper-immune 
  products.
  The production volumes of our hyper-immune products, which, including the 
  human rabies immunoglobulin and human hepatitis B immunoglobulin and tetanus 
  immunoglobulin products are subject to the visibility of the specific 
  vaccinated plasma and our production capacity.
  The supply of these specific vaccinated plasma in general requires several 
  months of lead time. Our production facility currently can only accommodate 
  the production of one type of hyper-immune products at any given time. And we
  rotate the production of different types of hyper-immune products from time 
  to time in response to the market demand.
  And as such, the sales volume of any given type of hyper-immune product may 
  vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. As David mentioned early, in 
  2013, we made certain R&D incentives with collaborating and acquiring 
  external expertise to improve our vaccination practice on specialty plasma 
  collection. And accordingly, the production yields and accordingly, we 
  increased the supply of rabies vaccinated plasma and expanded the production 
  of (inaudible) in second half of 2013.
  And that's what in this quarter, our sales volume from the rabies 
  immunoglobulin increased significantly from last year's same period, 2% to 
  12% this period. And on the other hand, the IVIG production, given the 
  partial production was allocated to the immunoglobulin to the rabies 
  immunoglobulin products. That's why IVIG products in Q1 [ph] declined and I 
  guess your question for the following quarters as, we want to actually, we 
  want to actually further pursue our strategy to improving our rabies 
  immunoglobulin market share in the remaining of the year.
  And also, we want to actually monitor the market trends relating to the 
  overall rabies immunoglobulin supply volume and adjust our production and the
  pricing, you know, the strategy according to the market, you know, the 
  dynamics. So, I guess that answer your question, Yi.

  Yi Chen, Analyst:
  Okay, thanks. My second question is, can you give us -- can you give us some 
  color on the time frame of new product launch during this year and next year?

  David Xiaoying Gao, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:
  Yeah, I mean the -- as we disclosed in our 10-K in March, we just got the 
  production approval in Guizhou for the new product, prothrombin complex. So, 
  after the Guizhou being the GNP license, so we will start to produce the PCC 
  since April. And also our standalone subsidiary in the final stage of 
  applying for the production approval and the manufacturing license for the 
  same product, the PCC, hopefully we can get the CFDA approval by end of the 
  year. That remains the two subsidiary, will start to produce the same product
  by end of this year.
  So that's for 2014, and 2015, as we disclosed in our pipeline and we have our
  -- the hepatitis B immunoglobulin for the intravenous injection, their new 
  parts expect to launch in the 2013. And 2016, we are looking forward to the 
  another product, we are -- in the 2016, as we disclose in the 10-K, we also 
  have three new pipeline products early stage, in the early stage, we just 
  launched end of last year. So, hopefully, those products will be launched to 
  the market in the -- after 2016.

  Yi Chen, Analyst:
  Okay. My final question is in terms of growth in plasma collection volume, 
  what is the expected number this year and going forward?

  Ming Yang, Chief Financial Officer:
  You mean the actual collection volume?

  Yi Chen, Analyst:
  Yes, plasma collection volume?

  Ming Yang, Chief Financial Officer:
  Yeah, I mean, I hope you can appreciate, we don't typically disclose this 
  data, primarily for the competitive purpose, which is, is known for the new 
  -- for the few companies, we compete with in this sector in China. But we 
  enjoy a highly competitive comfortable position in the industry and that we 
  intend to grow our collection volume in double-digit percentage terms in this
  year. As you might remember, we put in our last press release in March, last 
  year, we had a 16% year-over-year gross in collection volume as a Group. 
  Hopefully, that answers your question.

  Yi Chen, Analyst:
  Okay, I see. Thank you.

  Operator:
  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our next question is from (inaudible) 
  of Bank of America. Please go ahead.

  Unidentified Participant:
  Yes, good evening Ming and David. I have two questions. My first question is 
  in relation to the competitive landscape. You'd mentioned price (Technical 
  Difficulty) during the third quarter with one of the large imported absence 
  in the market, which we understand due to the licensing issue. Given this 
  competitor has stated their recent results that they plant to return to China
  in the second quarter. What is your outlook for albumin pricing? And do you 
  think some of the market share that captured during the first quarter will 
  stay with China Biologic the several quarters?

  David Xiaoying Gao, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:
  Well, you know, Matt, I think, this will be tough question, but I will try to
  answer because I just want to give you a few numbers, because as you 
  mentioned, the importation volume decline during the reporting period. That 
  should, because we actually monitor that -- the similar trends because we -- 
  from the data we saw, there is about 5% of decline in the importation volume 
  as overall.
  And the -- but we are not sure whether the importation volume will pick up 
  from the second quarter or second half of 2014. But we can only assume, if 
  the importation trends continue and also the local produced albumin volumes 
  remains the same, the trend and probably the albumin market, the pricing 
  probably will stay in a very similar, the trend, but if the overall imported 
  albumin pick up, the volume in the second quarter or going forward in the 
  remainder of the year, I think it will be hard to predict whether we will 
  lose some market share because first of all, in this quarter, we (Technical 
  Difficulty) more albumin because definitely there is increased shortage 
  situation.
  But again, we have different channels and the different selling region. So, I
  think the China Biologic will primarily focus on the existing regions, which 
  has less competitive situation because like our Shandong in our (inaudible) 
  region, which all are, pretty much the sales is a direct sales to the 
  hospitals.
  So from that sense, we probably will face less pressure. But again, the -- 
  overall, the market condition, probably it's hard to predict at this moment.

  Unidentified Participant:
  Yes. I'm sorry for asking the question, but given the dynamic trend, I had to
  ask. If I can ask the second question, just in regards to our coverage, Hong 
  Kong China healthcare and the impact to the anti-bribery and corruption 
  campaign and investigation of the second half of last year. Do you think that
  that investigation by the government has had any slowdown effect on the 
  industry of plasma therapeutic in the fourth quarter or third quarter? And do
  you think we could see any improvement in industry growth over the course of 
  2014 or '15? Thank you.

  David Xiaoying Gao, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:
  Yes, that question, I guess, we -- it's kind of remote for, at least for 
  China Biologic or the plasma manufacturer in general because you might notice
  the average selling expenses rate for this industry is a single, low-single 
  digit. So as compared to the other, the drug companies spend fairly [ph] 30% 
  40%.
  So, I guess from that perspective, the overall, the plasma protein 
  therapeutics manufacturer might get less scrutiny as other, the chemical 
  drugs companies, which adapt 40% selling expense. So, I guess, you know, we 
  don't view much impact. So, I guess in the last year. So going forward, we 
  don't expect the (inaudible) or the more severe impact will impact our 
  industry.

  Unidentified Participant:
  Great. Thank you.

  Ming Yang, Chief Financial Officer:
  Thanks.

  Operator:
  (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Peter (inaudible), a 
  Private Investor. Please go ahead.

  Unidentified Participant:
  Hi, Ming, it's Peter (inaudible) Just very quickly a few questions. First is 
  on rabies immunoglobulin and placenta polypeptide where you cited growth in 
  the higher margins, are there price controls on those? Were there any stages 
  in those price controls?

  Ming Yang, Chief Financial Officer:
  Yes. For this rabies immunoglobulin products, as also the government has 
  price winning [ph] on this one.

  Unidentified Participant:
  And were there any changes recently between producers at higher margin or 
  they --?

  Ming Yang, Chief Financial Officer:
  No, actually, I guess the higher margin is because recently, we improved our 
  vaccination practice and also the production yields, because our research 
  efforts, we made out in 2013 to improve our yields and because of yields 
  higher and we have a higher margin.

  Unidentified Participant:
  Okay. And my next question is on acquisitions, you have several references to
  the organic growth for now, but also taking our potential acquisitions, could
  you explain what type of profile would be suitable if you were to make an 
  acquisition and also how do you we plan to find?

  Ming Yang, Chief Financial Officer:
  For that question, I -- let me try to answer because acquisition in this 
  industry, there is a -- I think plasma protein, it happen only one, there is 
  only one reason, the deal was last year as one of the Chinese plasma, the 
  public company acquired another private plasma acquisition, which has very 
  high PE and have more than 20 times PE. So, I think for us, we are trading 
  below 20 times.
  So I think the benchmark for us to acquire, do any acquisition, we -- first 
  of all, we want to make sure, it will be accretive to our -- to bottom line. 
  And also, definitely M&A will be important growth strategy for the company 
  and we will actively be monitoring the market for any suitable, the candid 
  and probably we will be focusing on the plasma protein business, which is our
  core business and will be easily for us to manage.

  Unidentified Participant:
  In terms of finance?

  Ming Yang, Chief Financial Officer:
  Yeah. If there is a more suitable or we have synergy to the existing 
  business, we are definitely looking to that direction.

  Unidentified Participant:
  Okay. And my final question is regarding the SG&A and operating expenses or 
  the percentage of revenues obviously, an improvement there. I am just 
  wondering, is that sustainable or should we expect to see then further 
  improvement, can you give us some outlook on that, please?

  Ming Yang, Chief Financial Officer:
  Yeah, I mean, that's, that question -- definitely this quarter, if you 
  actually look at our reported financials, definitely the G&A expenses was 
  one, it's actually the one line expense contributed the overall margin 
  improvement, but if you actually happen to look into our prior year's 
  quarterly results, you will find actually the SG&A expenses varies quarter by
  quarter. And there's few reasons and this quarter, we particularly have the 
  G&A savings from the -- a few factors. Number one is, we actually had less, 
  the ease [ph] of the expenses, which is the employee share-based compensation
  expenses, which was fully amortized by end of the year.
  So, this year, we have less of that expense. And second, we have less 
  amortization expense related to the acquisition we made in 2008, that has 
  been fully amortized as well.
  And for the following quarters, we were committed to improving margins. 
  That's what our priority, but we can only assume there is no any unexpected, 
  you know, the instance happened, like last year, we have large legal expenses
  related to the corporate, the defense, the takeover threat, so we have a more
  -- incurred more legal expenses. And also we have (inaudible) strategic 
  investors litigation there, spend a lot of the legal expense.
  So, if we assume that expenses are not going to happen, which at this moment 
  is hard to predict, I guess, by the end of the year or the remaining 
  quarters, we -- again we are trying to improve the margins, but we cannot 
  guarantee the current, the SG&A will be the benchmark for the year, the 
  following quarters.
  And additionally, for the selling expenses, we implement to -- trying to 
  initiate a more, like promotion and marketing activities with the new region 
  like we disclosed in our 10-Q, we recently signed up with new agent in 
  Beijing and in the Tier 1 cities.
  So, we might incur more marketing expense with penetrating through the 
  high-end market. So, from that perspective, our selling expense might 
  actually increase.

  Unidentified Participant:
  Understood. Thank you, Ming.

  Ming Yang, Chief Financial Officer:
  Thanks.

  Operator:
  Our next question is from (inaudible). Please go ahead.

  Unidentified Participant:
  Hi, Ming. Hi, David. Just quickly, just, what do you expect going forward 
  with receivables in the inventory situation, is this temporary?

  David Xiaoying Gao, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:
  I think, so the receivable situation that we disclosed in the press release 
  and 10-Q, that basically, what happened is, the products was supposed to 
  deliver in the early March and because of the inspection, the government 
  actually, the inspection results was delayed.
  So we had to ship those products to the hospital by end of the March. So, 
  because in general, our credit terms to the hospitals are within 30 days to 
  -- or less 30 -- distributors, probably less than 30 days hospitals are 
  between 15 days to 90 days, according to the credit rating of the different 
  hospitals. So, this quarter the accounts receivable situation definitely will
  improve in the following quarter unless we have such similar inspection 
  delay, that's for the receivables.
  But for the inventory of the Guizhou facility, as Guizhou facility start to 
  production back to our resumed production in April, all the inventory 
  collected, the raw plasma particular raw plasma collected during the last 
  nine months or 10 months, were going to the production. So, you will notice a
  certain level of raw material inventory depletion during the next few 
  quarters.
  And also for the inventories, again, overall, the inventory turnover days did
  not actually change a lot. So it basically remained comparable. So, from that
  perspective, the accounts receivable situation is not a significant issue 
  actually.

  Unidentified Participant:
  Okay. But with your inventory you were quite low at the end of December, 
  right. I imagine you already started sort of collecting in preparation for 
  the Guizhou plant to come back into production. So, why were they low at the 
  end of December and then certainly high at the end of March?

  Ming Yang, Chief Financial Officer:
  If you look at the inventory, you have to look into the different lines. We 
  have a raw material and work-in-process and the finished goods, right. So, if
  you look at overall combination of the three, yeah, it varies, but if you 
  look at the inventory of the, I guess, we will be actually moving from the 
  raw materials to the finished products and also because this quarter, the 
  collection volume growth won't contribute as raw plasma growth. Now was the 
  reason why raw materials increased.

  Unidentified Participant:
  Okay. Thank you.

  Ming Yang, Chief Financial Officer:
  Yes.

  Operator:
  I'm showing no further questions. This concludes our question-and-answer 
  session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any 
  closing remarks.

  David Xiaoying Gao, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:
  Thank you for your participation and ongoing support for China Biologic. Have
  a good day.

  Operator:
  The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's 
  presentation. You may now disconnect.

China Biologic Announces Favorable Reduction in Value Added Tax Rate

     China Biologic Announces Favorable Reduction in Value Added Tax Rate

PR Newswire

BEIJING, June 23, 2014

BEIJING, June 23, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- China Biologic Products, Inc. (NASDAQ:
CBPO, "China Biologic" or the "Company"), a leading plasma-based
biopharmaceutical company in China, today announced that on June 18, 2014, the
Ministry of Finance of China and the State Administration of Taxation of China
jointly published a notice to reduce and unify the value added tax ("VAT")
rate on sales of a wide range of products in China, which will take effect on
July 1, 2014. Pursuant to the notice, the VAT rate on sales of human blood and
blood component based biopharmaceutical products will be reduced from the
current rate of 6% to 3%. The Company believes that the reduction in VAT rate
will be applicable to and will have a favorable impact on the sales of all
plasma based products of its majority-owned subsidiaries Shandong Taibang
Biological Products Co., Ltd. and Guizhou Taibang Biological Products Co.,
Ltd. Although the Company is still assessing the quantitative impact of this
favorable VAT reduction on its future results of operation, the Company
expects that once implemented this reduction in the VAT rate will have a
positive impact on its sales and net income in the second half of 2014 and
onwards as its sales revenue is recognized as the invoiced value of products
sold minus VAT.

[Delayed] iKang Healthcare Group (KANG US): EPS & TP upgrades on better outlook; New TP USD21.30

This story was delayed by 8 days. See {CMHK<GO>} to subscribe to real-time
delivery.

1. Factoring in a stronger-than-expected FY13 results (Mar-YE
2014) and company growth guidance for FY14E, we adjusted up our
FY14E and FY15E EPS estimates by 4% and 6%, respectively.
2. We expect 44% EPS CAGR FY13-16E on 1) strong growth in number
of customer visits, 2) ASP uptrend, 3) strong growth of higher-
value-added Disease Screening business, and 4) M&A. 
3. Our key FY14E-16E financial estimates are revised up by 1-8%.
Our 12-month TP is lifted by 16% to USD21.30. Reiterate Buy
rating.

What’s new
iKang reported better-than-expected FY13 results that beat our
net profit estimate by 9% and revenue estimate by 5%, thanks to
stronger growth in customer visit volume and ASP. The net profit
beat would have been 12% on same-tax-rate basis. Actual 32%
effective tax rate was 2-ppt higher than our estimate. Greater
economies of scale and cost control helped improve OPM by 2-ppt
YoY. Higher-margin Disease Screening revenue grew 64% vs. 49%
for Medical Exam and 51% for total revenue. 

Implications/ Our views
Our revised model estimates have factored in management’s FY14E
growth guidance, which should be achievable given 1) solid M&A
progress where 7 of the target 12-15 new store additions have
been confirmed and there remain 9 months to Mar-YE 2015, 2) ASP
uptrend thanks to management’s new higher-priced product
strategy and greater sales marketing discipline, 3) continued
focus in cross-selling higher-value-added services to
individuals, and 4) customer volume growth thanks to continued
market share gain. 

Valuation/ Key risks
New TP USD21.30 is based on 1.0x FY14E PEG using 43% FY15E EPS
growth, discount to 1.2x for US-listed peers and 1.7x for Asia-
listed peers. Stock now trades at 25x FY15E PER, vs. expected
44% EPS CAGR FY13-16E. Key risks include new store/service
opening delays, M&A execution and integration, more intensified
competition.
